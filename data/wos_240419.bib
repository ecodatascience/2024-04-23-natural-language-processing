Title = {Missing ecology: integrating ecological perspectives with the
   social-ecological system framework},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE COMMONS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {7},

Pages = {432-453},
Abstract = {The social-ecological systems framework was designed to provide a common
   research tool for interdisciplinary investigations of social-ecological
   systems. However, its origin in institutional studies of the commons
   belies its interdisciplinary ambitions and highlights its relatively
   limited attention to ecology and natural scientific knowledge. This
   paper considers the biophysical components of the framework and its
   epistemological foundations as it relates to the incorporation of
   knowledge from the natural sciences. It finds that the mixture of
   inductive and deductive reasoning associated with socially-oriented
   investigations of these systems is lacking on the ecological side, which
   relies upon induction alone. As a result the paper proposes the addition
   of a seventh core sub-system to the social-ecological systems framework,
   ecological rules, which would allow scholars to explicitly incorporate
   knowledge from the natural sciences for deductive reasoning. The paper
   shows, through an instructive case study, how the addition of ecological
   rules can provide a more nuanced description of the factors that
   contribute to outcomes in social-ecological systems.},

Title = {Institutional fit and the sustainability of social-ecological systems},
Journal = {CURRENT OPINION IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {14},
Pages = {34-40},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The literature on institutional fit is developing rapidly within the
   broader discourse on sustainability which has resulted in a diverse, but
   sometimes inconsistent program of research. Therefore we review the
   recent literature on the fit between institutions and social-ecological
   systems to identify three general types of fit: namely, ecological fit,
   social fit and social-ecological system fit. Each of these draws
   attention to different dimensions of social-ecological systems, with
   their own unique set of evaluative criteria. Although diversity is
   generally beneficial for the production of knowledge, it can also pose
   immense challenges as scholars and practitioners seek to build
   theoretically rigorous and practically useful knowledge concerning the
   sustainability of social-ecological systems. Therefore we present a
   typology which defines and summarizes the three major types of fit and
   can be used to organize and advance systematic theoretical and policy
   relevant inquiry.},

Title = {Mapping social-ecological systems: Identifying `green-loop' and
   `red-loop' dynamics based on characteristic bundles of ecosystem service
   use},
Journal = {GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {34},
Pages = {218-226},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {We present an approach to identify and map social-ecological systems
   based on the direct use of ecosystem services by households. This
   approach builds on the premise that characteristic bundles of ecosystem
   service use represent integrated expressions of different underlying
   social-ecological systems. We test the approach in South Africa using
   national census data on the direct use of six provisioning services
   (freshwater from a natural source, firewood for cooking, firewood for
   heating, natural building materials, animal production, and crop
   production) at two different scales. Based on a cluster analysis, we
   identify three distinct ecosystem service bundles that represent
   social-ecological systems characterized by low, medium and high levels
   of direct ecosystem service use among households. We argue that these
   correspond to `green-loop', `transition' and `red-loop' systems as
   defined by Cumming et al. (2014). When mapped, these systems form
   coherent spatial units that differ from systems identified by additive
   combinations of separate social and biophysical datasets, the most
   common method of mapping social-ecological systems to date. The
   distribution of the systems we identified is mainly determined by social
   factors, such as household income, gender of the household head, and
   land tenure, and only partly determined by the supply of natural
   resources. An understanding of the location and characteristic resource
   use dynamics of different social-ecological systems allows for policies
   to be better targeted at the particular sustainability challenges faced
   in different areas. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Title = {The robustness mechanism of the rural social-ecological system in
   response to the impact of urbanization--Evidence from irrigation commons
   in China},
Journal = {WORLD DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {178},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Urbanization is essential for achieving rapid development. In this
   process, the labor outmigration from rural areas to cities caused by
   urbanization has diversified the impacts on the robustness of the rural
   social-ecological system. However, existing research has rarely
   discussed the internal mechanism of the response of the rural
   social-ecological system to the impact of urbanization. Based on the
   coupled infrastructure systems framework, in this paper, the internal
   interactions of the rural social-ecological system responding to the
   impact of urbanization are discussed. An empirical test is conducted
   using survey data from 123 villages of 14 Chinese provinces. Focusing on
   the specific practice of China, this paper further discusses how the
   robustness of the rural socialecological system can be ensured under
   external impact. The main conclusions are as follows: under the impact
   of urbanization, the internal interaction paths with which the rural
   social-ecological system maintains robustness at the operational level
   are not unique. These different internal interaction paths may not only
   make the rural social-ecological system automatically realize a virtuous
   and robust cycle under the impact of urbanization, they may also cause a
   gradual collapse of the rural social-ecological system. Further, the
   discussion of China's specific practice shows that it is key to provide
   institutional rules to guarantee the operational processes through the
   collective-choice process, thus ensuring the robustness of the rural
   social-ecological system under the impact of urbanization. The
   inspection of the interaction mechanisms in this study may obtain some
   restricted views on the general laws that may be contained in the
   complex interaction within the rural social-ecological system, and
   provide a theoretical basis developing countries can apply to realize
   rural revitalization when faced with the irreversible wave of
   urbanization.},

Abstract = {Ostrom's framework to analyse the sustainability of social-ecological
   systems has attracted great interest in the last years. It was not
   conceived to characterise systems, but its nature and structure make it
   very appealing to be used with this objective. However, its use to
   characterise three social-ecological systems where common-pool resource
   management is central created some methodological struggles and
   difficulties for comparing outcomes. This paper aims to present some
   adaptations developed for improving the framework's comprehensiveness
   and practical applicability at local level, such as a transdisciplinary
   description of the second-level variables, the definition of a set of
   third-level variables to facilitate and enrich the descriptions and
   additional guidelines for gathering the information and planning data
   searching processes at local level. The whole process of adapting and
   applying the framework was the result of collaboration among scientists,
   and local researchers and stakeholders. The adapted framework permitted
   a comprehensive and comparable characterisation of the social-ecological
   systems analysed and facilitated its use by the local communities.},

Title = {Using social-ecological systems theory to evaluate large-scale
   comanagement efforts: a case study of the Inuvialuit Settlement Region},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {22},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Comanagement efforts are increasingly tasked with overseeing natural
   resource governance at a large scale. I examine comanagement of
   subsistence harvesting in the Inuvialuit Settlement Region (ISR) of the
   western Canadian Arctic, using a social-ecological systems framework. In
   doing so, this study joins a growing list of research that reviews
   design principles commonly found in successful small-scale commons
   management and applies them to a large resource area. This research uses
   the management of beluga (Delphinapterus leucas) and barren-ground
   caribou (Rangifer tarandus groenlandicus) as case studies in
   understanding the management framework of the Inuvialuit Settlement
   Region, as each species is important in Inuvialuit culture and is
   actively managed and monitored. Comanagement bodies in the study area
   display many of the institutional design principles that are
   characteristic of successful social-ecological systems. Particularly
   mentionable are the presence of well-organized nested enterprises and a
   strong incorporation of local knowledge and monitoring. This supports
   the application of institutional design principles in large-scale
   analyses of resource management. However, due to the network of policy
   and management outside the ISR that influences each species, this
   research suggests that in cases of wide-ranging resource bases, these
   types of analyses may be better suited to evaluating broad management
   networks rather than discrete governing regions.},

Abstract = {Different social-ecological systems around the world are managed under
   community-based natural resource management (CBNRM) strategies. This
   paper analyses how CBNRM strategies influence the resilience of
   social-ecological systems to the disturbances they face, drawing upon
   the experience of three Latin American cases (two in Mexico and one in
   Colombia). The cases differ in their CBNRM approach and in the time
   these governance systems have been in place. By using a mixed-method
   approach, we review the socio-ecological history and describe each CBNRM
   characteristics. We then assess their resilience to socioeconomic and
   environmental disturbances through a set of indicators. We found that
   CBNRM strategies influence positively and negatively resilience and that
   internal decisions might address important threats. On the positive
   side, the social-ecological systems with longer tradition of CBNRM and
   more local buy-in of commonly agreed objectives appear to be more
   resilient to environmental challenges. But, internal governance factors
   such as power imbalances, poor income distribution, and gender
   inequities linked to CBNRM undermine resilience and foster out
   migration. Finally, communities appear to have limited capacities to
   cope with external disturbances such as global drivers of change or
   national policies that negatively affect their social-ecological
   resilience.},

Abstract = {As part of an international collaboration to compare large-scale
   commons, we used the Social-Ecological Systems Meta-Analysis Database
   (SESMAD) to systematically map out attributes of and changes in the
   Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (GBRMP) in Australia. We focus on eight
   design principles from common-pool resource (CPR) theory and other key
   social-ecological systems governance variables, and explore to what
   extent they help explain the social and ecological outcomes of park
   management through time. Our analysis showed that commercial fisheries
   management and the re-zoning of the GBRMP in 2004 led to improvements in
   ecological condition of the reef, particularly fisheries. These boundary
   and rights changes were supported by effective monitoring, sanctioning
   and conflict resolution. Moderate biophysical connectivity was also
   important for improved outcomes. However, our analysis also highlighted
   that continued challenges to improved ecological health in terms of
   coral cover and biodiversity can be explained by fuzzy boundaries
   between land and sea, and the significance of external drivers to even
   large-scale social-ecological systems (SES). While ecological and
   institutional fit in the marine SES was high, this was not the case when
   considering the coastal SES. Nested governance arrangements become even
   more important at this larger scale. To our knowledge, our paper
   provides the first analysis linking the re-zoning of the GBRMP to CPR
   and SES theory. We discuss important challenges to coding large-scale
   systems for meta-analysis.},

Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {27},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Much is known about collective action in the commons but little is known
   about the effects of migration as an exogenous shock. We study the case
   of China where at least 280 million people have migrated from the rural
   areas to the cities over the last four decades. We apply the
   social-ecological system (SES) framework along with the theory of
   collective action using survey data from 1985 households in 20 provinces
   throughout China. Data was analyzed using confirmatory factor analysis,
   ordered probit regression with instrumental variables, structural
   equation modeling, and interaction effects analysis. We find that
   migration exerts a significant negative effect on collective action in
   the commons and its effect is mediated by four mechanisms: resource
   dependence, leadership, social capital, and sense of community. Of
   these, resource dependence and leadership account for about two-thirds
   of the total effect. The SES framework has been shown to be a useful
   tool for empirically studying complex, multi-variable, nonlinear,
   cross-scale, and dynamic social-ecological systems.},

Abstract = {A central challenge facing the study the environmental governance is the
   lack of common-understanding of important concepts. Critical concepts
   such as social boundaries, property rights, and resource dependence are

   the accumulation of scientific evidence regarding the most effective
   ways to address challenging environmental problems. As members of the
   Social-ecological systems meta-analysis database (SESMAD) project, we
   have addressed this challenge by developing a repository of variables
   associated with many of the most important concepts across a range of
   fields related to environmental governance. In this paper we describe
   the infrastructure behind the repository, the range of variables it
   includes, and how it can enable scholars across a range of fields to
   more systematically select and measure the variables to include in their

Abstract = {Even though the study of the commons has been expanding rapidly in the
   past years, and there have been multiple cases of successful local
   conservation initiatives, still, significant gaps in knowledge remain.
   The Social-Ecological Systems framework attempts to analyse the linkages
   between the ``human system{''} (society) and the ``natural system{''}
   (ecosystems). In every conservation attempt, the interactions and
   feedback between the two systems become evident. By examining thoroughly
   this relationship through the SES lens, we can develop a deep and
   holistic understanding of the processes that should be taken into
   consideration before the implementation of conservation actions. This
   study, through the exploration of the fisheries management procedures in
   Japan, attempts to develop an understanding of how the adoption of the
   Social-Ecological Systems approach could promote local development in
   the insular periphery of the developed world, in countries like Greece,
   where public participation in the decision-making processes is limited.},

Title = {Transformation of resource management institutions under globalization:
   the case of songgye community forests in South Korea.},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {19},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {The context in which many self-governed commons systems operate will
   likely be significantly altered as globalization processes play out over
   the next few decades. Such dramatic changes will induce some systems to
   fail and subsequently to be transformed, rather than merely adapt.
   Despite this possibility, research on globalization-induced
   transformations of social-ecological systems (SESs) is still
   underdeveloped. We seek to help fill this gap by exploring some patterns
   of transformation in SESs and the question of what factors help explain
   the persistence of cooperation in the use of common-pool resources
   through transformative change. Through the analysis of 89 forest commons
   in South Korea that experienced such transformations, we found that
   there are two broad types of transformation, cooperative and
   noncooperative. We also found that two system-level properties,
   transaction costs associated group size and network diversity, may
   affect the direction of transformation. SESs with smaller group sizes
   and higher network diversity may better organize cooperative
   transformations when the existing system becomes untenable.},

   Systems, Resilience, and Collaborative Learning},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {9},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The Anthropocene is characterized by rapid global change, necessitating
   adaptive governance. But how can such adaptive governance be
   operationalized? The article offers a three-point argument to approach
   this question. First, people and environment need to be considered
   together, as social (human) and ecological (biophysical) subsystems are
   linked by mutual feedbacks, and are interdependent and co-evolutionary.
   These integrated systems of humans and environment (social-ecological
   systems) provide an appropriate unit of analysis. Second, the resilience
   approach deals with change in multilevel complex systems, and has
   stimulated much of the adaptive governance literature by addressing
   uncertainty and adaptation to unforeseen future changes. Third, there is
   a need to foster collaborative approaches to improve social and
   institutional learning, as for example in adaptive management,
   collaborative learning networks, and knowledge co-production.
   Collaborative learning is perhaps where further research,
   experimentation, and application might make a difference for
   operationalizing adaptive governance, with a focus on institutions, at
   all levels from local to international.},

Abstract = {Even though the study of the commons has been expanding rapidly in the
   past years, and there have been multiple cases of successful local
   conservation initiatives, still, significant gaps in knowledge remain.
   The Social-Ecological Systems framework attempts to analyse the linkages
   between the ``human system{''} (society) and the ``natural system{''}
   (ecosystems). In every conservation attempt, the interactions and
   feedback between the two systems become evident. By examining thoroughly
   this relationship through the SES lens, we can develop a deep and
   holistic understanding of the processes that should be taken into
   consideration before the implementation of conservation actions. This
   study, through the exploration of the fisheries management procedures in
   Japan, attempts to develop an understanding of how the adoption of the
   Social-Ecological Systems approach could promote local development in
   the insular periphery of the developed world, in countries like Greece,
   where public participation in the decision-making processes is limited.},

   Empirical test of the social-ecological system framework in China},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {78},
Pages = {234-244},
Abstract = {Land fragmentation is an interesting physical character in some
   developing countries, especially China. This study aims to discover the
   direct and mediated effects of land fragmentation on collective action
   in China based on an empirical test and the social-ecological system
   framework. We introduce three innovations to the literature on
   collective action in the commons. First, we focus on the mechanism of
   land fragmentation on collective action in the commons, which has been
   largely ignored in the literature. Second, building on the
   social-ecological system framework, we use structural equation modeling,
   which is robust to endogeneity and latent variable problems. Third, we
   use original survey data from 3895 households and 284 villages from 17
   provinces/regions in China, a critical case because China has some of
   the most fragmented farmland use in the world. We find that land
   fragmentation has a direct negative effect on irrigation collective
   action. And besides the direct negative effect, there are four indirect
   factors: dependency on farming, irrigation rule-making, economic
   pressure and land circulation. Of these, the first three have a negative
   effect, and the last one, a positive effect. Our findings add to the
   theoretical literature on collective action in the commons and suggest
   new policy handles for more efficient land and labor markets in China.},

Title = {How Did the Lost Shangri-La Get Lost? The Tragedy of the Groundwater
   Commons in Lijiang, China},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Groundwater is critical to human survival, however, it has constantly
   been overexploited around the world. Despite hydrological causes and the
   effects of global climate change, groundwater governance has an
   essential role to play in causing or preventing such overexploitation.
   This paper presented a case of groundwater governance in Lijiang,
   renowned for its natural beauty and exotic cultures, located in
   northwest Yunnan, China. Since being designated as a UNESCO World
   Heritage site in the 1990s, Lijiang has experienced dramatic tourism
   development, which eventually escalated its groundwater crisis. This
   paper applied the diagnostic approach of social-ecological systems to
   analyse the institutionalised governance process in the case of Lijiang
   and substantiated the effectiveness of the Social-Ecological Systems
   (SES) approach in explaining groundwater management issues. Two
   significant findings were drawn in the case of Lijiang. First,
   institutional arrangements may play an essential role in resource
   management, but their analysis is lacking between macro modelling of
   planetary boundaries of the Earth and micro surveys of individual and
   community behaviour. The SES framework offered a useful tool to fill
   this gap. Second, the designation of Lijiang's Outstanding Universal
   Values as a world heritage site ironically damaged its local cultural
   intimacy, which nurtured generations of collective action for Naxi
   people, escalating the tragedy of its groundwater commons.},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {A common pattern of environmental crises is a vicious cycle between
   environmental degradation and socioeconomic disturbances. Here we show
   that while such feedbacks may give rise to critical transitions in
   social-ecological systems, at the same time they can offer novel
   opportunities for anticipating them. We model a community that has joint
   access to the harvest grounds of a resource that is prone to collapse.
   Individuals are tempted to overexploit the resource, while a cooperative
   harvesting norm spreads through the community via interpersonal
   relations. Both social and ecological collapses can be induced by
   environmental or socio-economic driving forces. Regardless of the type
   and cause of collapse we find that upcoming transitions may be detected
   using simple socio-economic response variables, such as individual
   profits. Our findings suggest that such alternative sources of
   information can be used to detect upcoming critical transitions in
   social-ecological systems. However, we also find that robust detection
   of critical transitions may be confounded by recovery attempts
   undertaken by resource users in the vicinity of an upcoming collapse,
   which may be falsely interpreted as a stabilization of the
   social-ecological system. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Year = {2023},

Abstract = {We present a collaboratively developed social-ecological model of the
   Kenai River Fishery. We developed the model through iterative interviews
   with stakeholders throughout the Kenai Peninsula using a novel
   participatory Fuzzy Cognitive Mapping process grounded in Ostrom's
   social-ecological systems framework. Individual social -ecological
   models, developed one-on-one with stakeholders, were combined into a
   single aggregated model representing the system's structure and
   function. We validated this aggregated model through subsequent
   in-terviews with stakeholders and focused literature reviews. The result
   is a model that can: 1) illustrate the breadth and interconnectedness of
   the Kenai River Fishery's social-ecological system; 2) be used to
   facilitate discussions around management of the fishery; and 3) be used
   to explore the components and interactions that move the system toward
   or away from sustainability. Using the model, we identify how the nature
   of salmon (migratory) and their habitat (large and unpredictable) leads
   to uncertainty about effective management strategies. This uncertainty,
   in addition to a large and diverse set of resource users, creates
   conflicting management goals that ultimately limit the governance system
   in making decisions that might increase the sustainability of the
   fishery.},

Abstract = {Today, economic experiments are well accepted in mainstream economics.
   They are also widely applied in ecological economics, often focusing on
   institutions. Yet, many empirical studies in this field lack a sound
   theoretical foundation of institutions and institutional change. In this
   paper, I show that in a structure-agency framework three theoretical
   viewpoints on institutions can be distinguished. They can be viewed as
   (1) structures that shape incentives, (2) cognitive media, embedded in
   beliefs and cognition of agents, or (3) evolving from a process of
   agents' choices and structural aspects. Using examples from the
   empirical experimental literature, I argue that all three viewpoints are
   mirrored in experimental practice, and that these can be organized into
   an institutional typology of economic experiments. Placing special
   emphasis on experiments with endogenous institutional choice and their
   relationship to evolutionary economic theory, I discuss under which
   conditions experiments are a useful method for the analysis of
   social-ecological systems, concluding that methodological and methodical
   innovations are an important prerequisite for challenging the dominant
   paradigm of neoclassical economics. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Ecologically sustainable but unjust? Negotiating equity and authority in
   common-pool marine resource management},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {19},
Number = {4},
Abstract = {Under appropriate conditions, community-based fisheries management can
   support sound resource stewardship, with positive social and
   environmental outcomes. Evaluating indigenous peoples' involvement in
   commercial sea cucumber and geoduck fisheries on the central coast of
   British Columbia, Canada, we found that the current social-ecological
   system configuration is relatively ecologically sustainable according to
   stock assessments. However, the current system also results in perceived
   inequities in decision-making processes, harvesting allocations, and
   socioeconomic benefits. As a result, local coastal resource managers
   envision a transformation of sea cucumber and geoduck fisheries
   governance and management institutions. We assessed the potential
   robustness of the proposed institutions using Elinor Ostrom's
   common-pool resource design principles. Grounded in the region's legal,
   political, and historical context, our analysis suggests that greater
   local involvement in these invertebrate fisheries and their management
   could provide more benefits to local communities than the status quo
   while maintaining an ecologically sustainable resource. Our research
   highlights the importance of explicitly addressing historical context
   and equity considerations in social-ecological system analyses and when
   renegotiating the institutions governing common-pool resources.},

Abstract = {The paper contributes to the social-ecological systems literature by
   adapting and using Elinor Ostrom's Social-Ecological System (SES)
   framework in the context of a coastal ecosystem. We modified the SES
   framework in the case of the Cienaga Grande de Santa Marta (CGSM), an
   estuarine lagoon in the Caribbean coast of Colombia. The ecological
   importance of CGSM and its species is undeniable. This paper aims to
   understand why collective action for a sustainable use of CGSM's fishery
   resources has not taken place. In order to respond to that question, we
   created new variables within the social, economic, and political
   settings of the SES framework. The results show that the fishers' fear
   of the indiscriminate and strong violence that illegal armed groups have
   inflicted on them since the 1960s and the economic development in the
   Colombian Caribbean region help explain the lack of collective action.},

Abstract = {Environmental conservation initiatives, including marine protected areas
   (MPAs), have proliferated in recent decades. Designed to conserve marine
   biodiversity, many MPAs also seek to foster sustainable development. As
   is the case for many other environmental policies and programs, the
   impacts of MPAs are poorly understood. Social-ecological systems, impact
   evaluation, and common-pool resource governance are three complementary
   scientific frameworks for documenting and explaining the ecological and
   social impacts of conservation interventions. We review key components
   of these three frameworks and their implications for the study of
   conservation policy, program, and project outcomes. Using MPAs as an
   illustrative example, we then draw upon these three frameworks to
   describe an integrated approach for rigorous empirical documentation and
   causal explanation of conservation impacts. This integrated
   three-framework approach for impact evaluation of governance in
   social-ecological systems (3FIGS) accounts for alternative explanations,
   builds upon and advances social theory, and provides novel policy
   insights in ways that no single approach affords. Despite the inherent
   complexity of social-ecological systems and the difficulty of causal
   inference, the 3FIGS approach can dramatically advance our understanding
   of, and the evidentiary basis for, effective MPAs and other conservation
   initiatives.},

Abstract = {The literature on common pool resource (CPR) governance lists numerous
   factors that influence whether a given CPR system achieves ecological
   long-term sustainability. Up to now there is no comprehensive model to
   integrate these factors or to explain success within or across cases and
   sectors. Difficulties include the absence of large-N studies, the
   incomparability of single case studies, and the interdependence of
   factors. We propose (1) a synthesis of 24 success factors based on the
   current social-ecological systems (SES) framework and a literature
   review and (2) the application of neural networks on a database of CPR
   management case studies in an attempt to test the viability of this
   synthesis. This method allows us to obtain an implicit quantitative and
   rather precise model of the interdependencies in CPR systems. Given such
   a model, every success factor in each case can be manipulated
   separately, yielding different predictions for success. This could
   become a fast and inexpensive way to analyze, predict, and optimize
   performance for communities worldwide facing CPR challenges. Existing
   theoretical frameworks could be improved as well.},

Abstract = {There are numerous frameworks for studying the governance of shared
   resources that have been discussed extensively in the literature.
   Although these frameworks have been applied to multiple case studies,
   these applications are often idiosyncratic, subject to the
   interpretation of the researcher, and raise concerns regarding the
   operational use of frameworks for case-study comparisons. As a result,
   insights from these studies have not lived up to the aspirations of the
   frameworks to generate generalizable knowledge. Here, based on several
   case studies and our experience using various frameworks for analyzing
   social-ecological systems, we undertake the task of providing a
   mechanism to systematically qualify interactions among ecological,
   social, institutional, and built infrastructure systems that impact the
   governance of shared resources. Specifically, we generate a series of
   archetypal social-ecological systems and extract from them a verb list
   to represent key interactions in the Robustness of Coupled
   Infrastructure Systems Framework. We then extend and refine the list
   based on three case studies of coastal social-ecological systems. We
   categorize these verbs and use them to demonstrate governance patterns
   across the case studies. We find that governance entities predominantly
   seek control over paths of change directed at lower governance levels
   rather than acting at their own level. Governance entities shed
   responsibility to lower governance levels without providing necessary
   resources. Finally, we find high potential for the cancelation of
   efforts due to lack of coordination among governance entities. The set
   of system archetypes and associated verb list is a first step in laying
   the foundation for a general typology of and a standardized protocol for
   representing the dynamics of CIS.},

Abstract = {On-going efforts to understand the dynamics of coupled social-ecological
   systems and common pool resources have led to the generation of numerous
   datasets based on a large number of case studies. This data has
   facilitated the identification of important factors and fundamental
   principles thereby increasing our understanding of such complex systems.
   However, the data at our disposal are often not easily comparable, have
   limited scope and scale, and are based on disparate underlying
   frameworks which inhibit synthesis, meta-analysis, and the validation of
   findings. Research efforts are further hampered when case inclusion
   criteria, variable definitions, coding schema, and inter-coder
   reliability testing are not made explicit in the presentation of
   research and shared among the research community. This paper first
   outlines challenges experienced by researchers engaged in a large-scale
   coding project; highlights valuable lessons learned; and finally
   discusses opportunities for future comparative case study analyses of

Abstract = {Attempts to identify relevant variables for the success or failure of
   sustainable management of social-ecological systems seem to be
   constrained by the inconsistent organization of the variables and the
   difficulties arising from their lack of comparability; both of these
   reduce generalizability to other systems. Therefore, to date, only a few
   comprehensive lists of attributes relevant to the performance of
   socio-ecological systems exist for sustainable management. This paper
   integrates such lists into a synthesis of 24 concepts. The scattered
   evidence of why each factor is important for sustainability has been
   compiled through a literature review. This concept synthesis may help to
   overcome some of the constraints of SES research by increasing the
   comparability of research designs and extending analyses from that of a
   few concepts for a few systems to widely applicable approaches in
   sustainability science.},

Title = {Can water systems foster commoning practices? Analysing leverages for
   self-organization in urban water commons as social-ecological systems},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {15},
Number = {3},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Research into urban commons has gained momentum in recent years. This
   article concentrates on the concept and analysis of urban water commons
   as social-ecological systems, which receive a less prominent focus in
   the literature than other commoning practices. In the light of the
   distinctive social and ecological values of water for both ecosystem
   health and human wellbeing and sociability, we argue that the presence
   of water systems can foster stakeholder engagement and leverage
   self-organization in urban commons. We test our hypothesis in a
   dynamically evolving urban water common: the recently restored Geoffrey
   Jellicoe's Water Gardens in Hemel Hempstead, England. We apply Ostrom's
   multilevel diagnostic tool, the ``Social-Ecological System
   framework{''}, to analyse the characteristics of the Gardens water
   system and their impact on the self-organizing process undertaken by the
   local community. Our application is supported by collection of primary
   and secondary data, including Jellicoe's design archived evidence, field
   observation data, in-depth interviews with key stakeholders, as well as
   data mining from social media (topic modelling of Facebook posts, review
   of Facebook user profiles, and Twitter mention-network analysis).
   Through our results, we identify a broad spectrum of characteristics of
   the Gardens urban water common that can catalyse the local
   self-organization dynamics. These include the leadership position of a
   specific non-governmental stakeholder group with knowledge and expertise
   on water ecosystems; active engagement of the local population across
   age groups in recreational activities on the water; community-building
   through expertise and knowledge-sharing on the peculiar natural and
   infrastructural components of the Gardens water systems; and, finally,
   continued online networking and social-media communication among
   different stakeholder groups on water-related activities.},

   the adoption of large-scale irrigation technology in Navarre (Spain)},

Abstract = {Many regional and national organisations promote the modernisation of
   agriculture by supporting new technologies to increase their territory's
   competitiveness in a free-market context. Such technologies and their
   associated intensive land management practices are geared towards
   obtaining higher yields. However, their application also entails changes
   in water and land management institutions, which could alter
   interactions among multiple components of the agrarian social-ecological
   system and potentially weaken the system. Here, we assess how these
   components and their relations change in a village situated in Navarre
   (Spain) after the uptake of large-scale irrigation infrastructure.
   Specifically, we analyse such changes by comparing how the design
   principles for robust social-ecological systems manifest before and
   after the adoption of large-scale irrigation. Our findings indicate that
   an unequal distribution of water and land induces some farmers to
   abandon their agrarian activities. Our case study also shows how
   irrigation communities have partially lost their autonomy to
   self-organise and make agrarian management-related decisions. We suggest
   that the adoption of large-scale irrigation in this region contributes
   to a decrease in cooperation among resource users, and between users and
   infrastructure providers. This is due to a decline in the capacity to
   achieve collective-choice arrangements and higher external control and
   monitoring of water use. We argue that the current agrarian management
   changes may damage social-ecological system robustness and affect the
   sustainable use of common-pool resources, leading farmers to
   maladaptation to climate and market variability.},

   can the variables found to be important in explaining outcomes on
   small-scale systems be scaled up to explain outcomes in large-scale
   environmental governance? In this special issue we report on our
   findings thus far through a set of case studies of large-scale

Abstract = {In social-ecological systems (SESs), social and biophysical dynamics
   interact within and between the levels of organization at multiple
   spatial and temporal scales. Cross-scale interactions (CSIs) are
   interdependences between processes at different scales, generating
   behaviour unpredictable at single scales. Understanding CSIs is
   important for improving SES governance, but they remain understudied.
   Theoretical models are needed that capture essential features while
   being simple enough to yield insights into mechanisms. In a stylized
   model, we study CSIs in a two-level system of weakly interacting
   communities harvesting a common-pool resource. Community members
   adaptively conform to, or defect from, a norm of socially optimal
   harvesting, enforced through social sanctioning both within and between
   communities. We find that each subsystem's dynamics depend sensitively
   on the other despite interactions being much weaker between subsystems
   than within them. When interaction is purely biophysical, stably high
   cooperation in one community can cause cooperation in the other to
   collapse. However, even weak social interaction can prevent the collapse
   of cooperation and instead cause collapse of defection. We identify
   conditions under which subsystem-level cooperation produces desirable
   system-level outcomes. Our findings expand evidence that collaboration
   is important for sustainably managing shared resources, showing its
   importance even when resource sharing and social relationships are weak.},

Abstract = {Different from the three classical and popular models of central
   authority, privatization, and self-governance which have been widely
   researched and applied in social-ecological policymaking in recent
   years, we propose an alternative model for collective action to resolve
   the problem of the tragedy of the commons. Our study is based on a
   series of game theoretic analyses and a field study of combating
   desertification in seven counties in Northwest China. The results show
   that scholars who have comparative advantages in knowledge and
   information over other social actors (such as herders and governments)
   can help game players resolve their collective action dilemma in
   social-ecological systems under certain conditions. This positive
   outcome can be achieved mainly through the participation of scholars as
   information providers, governmental agents, scholar-entrepreneurs, and
   pure game players. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {A diagnostic procedure for applying the social-ecological systems
   framework in diverse cases},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {20},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {The framework for analyzing sustainability of social-ecological systems
   (SES) framework of Elinor Ostrom is a multitier collection of concepts
   and variables that have proven to be relevant for understanding outcomes
   in diverse SES. The first tier of this framework includes the concepts
   resource system (RS) and resource units (RU), which are then further
   characterized through lower tier variables such as clarity of system
   boundaries and mobility. The long-term goal of framework development is
   to derive conclusions about which combinations of variables explain
   outcomes across diverse types of SES. This will only be possible if the
   concepts and variables of the framework can be made operational
   unambiguously for the different types of SES, which, however, remains a
   challenge. Reasons for this are that case studies examine other types of
   RS than those for which the framework has been developed or consider RS
   for which different actors obtain different kinds of RU. We explore
   these difficulties and relate them to antecedent work on common-pool
   resources and public goods. We propose a diagnostic procedure which
   resolves some of these difficulties by establishing a sequence of
   questions that facilitate the step-wise and unambiguous application of
   the SES framework to a given case. The questions relate to the actors
   benefiting from the SES, the collective goods involved in the generation
   of those benefits, and the action situations in which the collective
   goods are provided and appropriated. We illustrate the diagnostic
   procedure for four case studies in the context of irrigated agriculture
   in New Mexico, common property meadows in the Swiss Alps, recreational
   fishery in Germany, and energy regions in Austria. We conclude that the
   current SES framework has limitations when applied to complex, multiuse
   SES, because it does not sufficiently capture the actor
   interdependencies introduced through RS and RU characteristics and
   dynamics.},

Abstract = {The use of shared infrastructure to direct natural processes for the
   benefit of humans has been a central feature of human social
   organization for millennia. Today, more than ever, people interact with
   one another and the environment through shared human-made infrastructure
   (the Internet, transportation, the energy grid, etc.). However, there
   has been relatively little work on how the design characteristics of
   shared infrastructure affect the dynamics of social-ecological systems
   (SESs) and the capacity of groups to solve social dilemmas associated
   with its provision. Developing such understanding is especially
   important in the context of global change where design criteria must
   consider how specific aspects of infrastructure affect the capacity of
   SESs to maintain vital functions in the face of shocks. Using
   small-scale irrigated agriculture (the most ancient and ubiquitous
   example of public infrastructure systems) as a model system, we show
   that two design features related to scale and the structure of benefit
   flows can induce fundamental changes in qualitative behavior, i.e.,
   regime shifts. By relating the required maintenance threshold (a design
   feature related to infrastructure scale) to the incentives facing users
   under different regimes, our work also provides some general guidance on
   determinants of robustness of SESs under globalization-related stresses.},

Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {119},
Pages = {292-305},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Common property pastures (CPPs) in the Alps served as examples for
   successful self-governed resource use. During the past few decades, the
   situation has changed, and abandonment of marginal pastures with
   subsequent forest regrowth has been widely observed. To better
   understand current drivers, challenges, and policy impacts on the
   sustainable governance of common property pastures, we present an
   application of Ostroms' general framework for analyzing
   social-ecological systems (SESs). We use system dynamics (SD) modeling
   to operationalize the SES framework for the case study region of
   Grindelwald, Switzerland. Based on formative scenario analysis, we
   identify four consistent simulation scenarios. The simulation results
   show that increasing loss of common property pastures and resulting
   afforestation can be expected. Scenario assessment shows that policy
   blueprints such as liberalization or increased government support do not
   halt but instead accelerate abandonment of common property pastures. We
   conclude by discussing options for sustainably governing CPPs. (C) 2015

Title = {Application of the Ostrom framework in the analysis of a
   social-ecological system with multiple resources in a marine protected
   area},
Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Month = {AUG 14},
Abstract = {The framework proposed by Ostrom (2009) has become one of the most
   utilized tools to address the complexity of social-ecological systems.
   Most cases use this framework to analyze the systems from the
   perspective of a single resource unit. However, the livelihoods in
   several coastal communities are diverse, so that the users interact with
   multiple common-pool resources, which makes their analysis difficult. In
   this sense, it is important to identify the key elements of management
   to achieve the sustainable use of the resources. In this study, we were
   able to do this in a coastal community where commercial fishing,
   ecotourism, and recreational fishing coexist. The system of interest,
   located in the state of Quintana Roo, Mexico, was subdivided by resource
   type using a multi-method approach to data collection including surveys,
   interviews, and records review. A conceptual map was developed that
   shows how the second-tier variables are integrated through the
   governance and actors with the biophysical system. The actors involved
   in lobster fishing achieved a more complex governance system, followed
   by the ecotourism and recreational fishing; the complexity of the
   governance was related with the equity level of the actors. The analysis
   revealed the research gaps to develop management strategies and improve
   the sustainability of the system.},

Title = {Ruderal Resilience: Applying a Ruderal Lens to Advance Multispecies
   Urbanism and Social-Ecological Systems Theory},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN BUILT ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {8},
Month = {MAR 24},
Abstract = {As global urbanization accelerates, cities have become increasingly
   complex and hybridized, and host to novel urban landscape forms such as
   informal greenspaces or novel ecosystems that support ruderal and
   spontaneous vegetation. Researchers have documented the ecosystem
   services or benefits these systems provide, as well as the tradeoffs or
   disservices associated with biotic globalization. Despite evidence of
   their co-benefits, fragmented knowledge and biased views of these novel
   ecological forms contributes to an underestimation of their
   social-ecological role and potential for serving as a model for
   resilient and nature-based urban design and planning. The
   social-ecological systems discourse has improved understanding of these
   emerging conditions, yet may benefit from an attunement to a
   multispecies perspective, an ecosystem-based approach to urban planning
   and governance that recognizes the interdependencies of humans and other
   organisms. This article explores the potential social-ecological role of
   ruderal landscapes in facilitating this transition, referred to as
   ruderal resilience, as well as recent research in SES and resilience
   theory that may help advance concepts such as multispecies urbanism and
   planning. The aim is to consider the potential for spontaneous
   ecological self-organization to serve as a device for reinvigorating
   relationships with urban ecological commons and advancing
   social-ecological systems theory.},

Title = {Governing the invisible commons: Ozone regulation and the Montreal
   Protocol},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE COMMONS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {8},
Number = {2},
Pages = {337-360},
Abstract = {The Montreal Protocol is generally credited as a successful example of
   international cooperation in response to a global environmental problem.
   As a result, the production and consumption of ozone-depleting
   substances has declined rapidly, and it is expected that atmospheric
   ozone concentrations will return to their normal ranges toward the end
   of this century. This paper applies the social-ecological system
   framework and common-pool resource theory to explore the congruence
   between successful resolution of small-scale appropriation problems and
   ozone regulation, a large-scale pollution problem. The results of our
   analysis correspond closely to past studies of the Protocol that
   highlight the importance of attributes such as a limited number of major
   industrial producers, advances in scientific knowledge, and the
   availability of technological substitutes. However, in contrast to
   previous theoretical accounts that focus on one or a few variables, our
   analysis suggests that its success may have been the result of
   interactions between a wider range of SES attributes, many of which are
   associated with successful small-scale environmental governance.
   Although carefully noting the limitations of drawing conclusions from
   the analysis of a single case, our analysis reveals the potential for
   fruitful interplay between common-pool resource theory and large-scale
   pollution problems.},

   action in the irrigation commons: Evidence from China},
Journal = {AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {289},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Socialized agricultural services (SASs) have reshaped the smallholder
   agricultural system and promoted scale operations in rural China, but
   little is known about whether and how they affect rural collective
   action in the irrigation commons. Based on the social-ecological system
   framework, we apply an ordered probit model and a mediation model to
   examine the effects of SASs on rural collective action in the commons
   using a data set consisting of 7737 farm households from 448 villages in
   14 provinces in China. We show that SASs have a positive effect on
   collective action for the governance of the irrigation commons and can
   slow down and mitigate the negative effect of rural labor migration. In
   particular, SASs can help improve collective action by enhancing village
   leadership, fostering agricultural resource dependency, and diminishing
   economic heterogeneity among villagers. We contribute to the literature
   by investigating the effects of SASs on rural collective action, which
   reveals a self-regulatory mechanism inside of the social ecological
   system enabling it to adapt and restore balance under external shocks.
   Our findings have implications for the reform of the farming system and
   governance of the commons.},

Abstract = {Using two very different empirical settings, this paper emphasizes the
   required conditions for the successful crafting of sustainable
   institutions. In the first setting, different farmer groups in Cambodia
   and Vietnam try to establish a collective approach for small-scale
   community-based aquaculture and fail. In the second setting, the
   collective initiatives of urban women in India are analysed. The Indian
   women succeed in their objective of a fuel transition from firewood to
   gas cookers using a cooperative approach. Ostrom's variables identified
   in the ``Multitier Framework for Analyzing Social-Ecological Systems
   (SES){''} (Ostrom, 2007) are applied to local collective action
   initiatives in both settings to understand which factors make some of
   the groups succeed in their objectives and others fail. This research
   highlights the complexity as well as the uniqueness of different SESs.
   At the same time, the paper contributes to demonstrating the usability
   of the SES and certain variables to estimate the likelihood of success
   of self-organisation and crafting of rules. It highlights the relevance
   of certain conceptual variables for sustainable or unsustainable
   outcomes for different cases. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   management contexts},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},

Volume = {21},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {Local communities collectively managing common pool resources can play
   an important role in sustainable management, but they often lack the
   skills and context-specific tools required for such management. The
   complex dynamics of social-ecological systems (SES), the need for
   management capacities, and communities' limited empowerment and
   participation skills present challenges for community-based natural
   resource management (CBNRM) strategies. We analyzed the applicability of
   prospective structural analysis (PSA), a strategic foresight tool, to
   support decision making and to foster sustainable management and
   capacity building in CBNRM contexts and the modifications necessary to
   use the tool in such contexts. By testing PSA in three SES in Colombia,
   Mexico, and Argentina, we gathered information regarding the potential
   of this tool and its adaptation requirements. The results suggest that
   the tool can be adapted to these contexts and contribute to fostering
   sustainable management and capacity building. It helped identify the
   systems' dynamics, thus increasing the communities' knowledge about
   their SES and informing the decision-making process. Additionally, it
   drove a learning process that both fostered empowerment and built
   participation skills. The process demanded both time and effort, and
   required external monitoring and facilitation, but community members
   could be trained to master it. Thus, we suggest that the PSA technique
   has the potential to strengthen CBNRM and that other initiatives could
   use it, but they must be aware of these requirements.},

   lessons drawn from <i>serege</i>-commons in Muhur, Ethiopia},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {21},
Number = {4},
Abstract = {This ethnographic case study of serege-commons, communal pasture and
   forest in Muhur, Ethiopia, demonstrates the socially complex nature of
   the common property resource (CPR) system, including the factors behind
   its resilience and sustained operation. It reveals the multifaceted and
   interacting local processes that maintain the commons in the face of
   political economic processes that challenge common property management.
   The study shows how CPR use, crop cultivation, alternative livelihood
   strategies, out-migration, collective herding practices, management
   practices, and alternative sources of compliance interact, and these
   interacting processes reinforce each other and maintain a resilient CPR
   system. This study argues that there is not one single cause for
   sustainable CPR regimes. Instead, the resilience and sustained operation
   of the CPR system are due to a mix of interdependent elements and
   inter-reinforcing linkages related to CPR operations, and their
   interactions within complex social-ecological systems.},

   outcomes of governance efforts. We introduce an experimental environment
   that involves spatial and temporal resource dynamics in order to capture
   these two critical variables identified in field research. Previous
   behavioral experiments of commons dilemmas have found that people are
   willing to engage in costly punishment, frequently generating increases
   in gross benefits, contrary to game-theoretical predictions based on a
   static pay-off function. Results in our experimental environment find
   that costly punishment is again used but lacks a gross positive effect
   on resource harvesting unless combined with communication. These
   findings illustrate the importance of careful generalization from the
   laboratory to the world of policy.},

Abstract = {Sustainable resource management requires governance systems that
   facilitate effective collaboration among a variety of stakeholder
   interests, across jurisdictional scales and resource sectors. Yet, there
   is not widespread scholarly agreement on the key ingredients that need
   to be present to facilitate the effective collaborative governance of
   natural resources. To address this scholarly gap, we conducted a
   systematic literature review which revealed 17 publications that
   compiled essential lists of key factors for effective collaboration.
   From these studies across multiple disciplines, we identified 22 common
   factors associated with effective collaborative natural resource
   management, including near unanimous acceptance of the importance of
   nested governance structures and conflict resolution mechanisms. These
   22 factors, along with additional contextual and outcome-oriented
   factors, could begin to form a core set of factors to comparatively test
   large numbers of case studies on collaborative governance of
   social-ecological systems around the world.},

Abstract = {Although mismanagement of groundwater resources has resulted in their
   destruction over centuries, climate change is speeding up this process
   more than ever. On the one hand, urgent action by government bodies is
   needed to address the challenge. On the other hand, a vast body of
   literature proves that bottom-up collective action, although requiring a
   longer time period, is a better solution to manage such resources. This
   research aims to address this dilemma. The groundwater resource in
   Ardabil plain in Iran, which has long been managed solely through
   government intervention, has been chosen as a case study to explore the
   opportunities and limitations of managing a critically endangered area
   from a common pool resource perspective. Our study suggests that
   managing Ardabil groundwater resources should be conducted on two
   scales. The bottom-up institutional agreements should take place at
   village scale while the government should stay in charge of the overall
   organization at plain scale.},

Abstract = {It is well known that green urban commons enhance mental and physical
   well-being and improve local biodiversity. We aim to investigate how
   these outcomes are related in an urban system and which variables are
   associated with better outcomes. We model the outcomes of an urban
   common-box gardening-by applying the Social-Ecological Systems (SES)
   framework. We expand the SES framework by analyzing it from the
   perspective of social evolution theory. The system was studied
   empirically through field inventories and questionnaires and modeled
   quantitatively by Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). This method offers
   powerful statistical models of complex social-ecological systems. Our
   results show that objectively evaluated ecological outcomes and
   self-perceived outcomes are decoupled: gardening groups that
   successfully govern the natural resource ecologically do not necessarily
   report many social, ecological, or individual benefits, and vice versa.
   Social capital, box location, gardener concerns, and starting year
   influenced the changes in the outcomes. In addition, the positive
   association of frequent interactions with higher self-perceived
   outcomes, and lack of such association with relatedness of group members
   suggests that reciprocity rather than kin selection explains
   cooperation. Our findings exemplify the importance of understanding
   natural resource systems at a very low ``grassroot{''} level.},

Title = {Enhancing the Ostrom social-ecological system framework through
   formalization},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {19},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {Frameworks play an important role in analyzing social-ecological systems
   (SESs) because they provide shared concepts and variables that enable
   comparison between and accumulation of knowledge across multiple cases.
   One prominent SES framework focusing on local resource use has been
   developed by Elinor Ostrom and her colleagues. This framework is an
   extensive multi-tier collection of concepts and variables that have
   demonstrated relevance for explaining outcomes in a large number of case
   studies in the context of fishery, water, and forestry common-pool
   resources. The further development of this framework has raised a number
   of issues related to the formal relationships between the large number
   of concepts and variables involved. In particular, issues related to
   criteria for ordering the concepts into tiers, adding new concepts,
   defining outcomes metrics, and representing dynamics in the framework
   have been identified. We address these issues by applying methods from
   research fields that study formal relationships between concepts such as
   domain-specific languages, knowledge representation, and software
   engineering. We find that SES frameworks could include the following
   seven formal components: variables, concepts, attribution relationships,
   subsumption relationships, process relationships, aggregation
   relationships, and evaluation metrics. Applying these components to the
   Ostrom framework and a case study of recreational fishery, we find that
   they provide clear criteria for structuring concepts into tiers,
   defining outcome metrics, and representing dynamics. The components
   identified are generic, and the insights gained from this exercise may
   also be beneficial for the development of other SES frameworks.},

   property resources. Results show that the average group size remained
   remarkably stable over about six centuries, in contrast to a general
   increase in the regional population. The population more than doubled,
   but although single groups experienced fluctuations over time, the
   average group size remained stable. Ecological factors, such as managing
   forest instead of pasture land, played a minor role in determining group
   size. The evidence instead indicates that factors related to social
   interactions had a significant role in determining group size. We

Abstract = {In this article we extend the theory of community prediction by
   presenting seven hypotheses for predicting community structure in a
   directionally changing world. The first three address well-studied
   community responses to environmental and ecological change: ecological
   communities are most likely to exhibit threshold changes in structure
   when perturbations cause large changes in limiting soil or sediment
   resources, dominant or keystone species, or attributes of disturbance
   regime that influence community recruitment. Four additional hypotheses
   address social-ecological interactions and apply to both ecological
   communities and social-ecological systems. Human responsiveness to
   short-term and local costs and benefits often leads to human actions
   with unintended long-term impacts, particularly those that are far from
   the site of decision making or are geographically dispersed. Policies
   are usually based on past conditions of ecosystem services rather than
   expected future trends. Finally, institutions that strengthen negative
   feedbacks between human actions and social-ecological consequences can
   reduce human impacts through more responsive (and thus more effective)
   management of public ecosystem services. Because of the large role that
   humans play in modifying ecosystems and ecosystem services, it is
   particularly important to test and improve social-ecological hypotheses
   as a basis for shaping appropriate policies for long-term ecosystem
   resilience.},

Title = {Understanding how governance emerges in social-ecological systems:
   insights from archetype analysis},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {28},
Number = {2},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {. This paper is motivated by the question: how does governance emerge
   within social-ecological systems (SESs)? Addressing this question is
   critical for fostering sustainable transformations because it directs
   attention to the context specific and process intensive nature of
   governance as arising from the internal dynamics (i.e., interplay of
   feedbacks and interdependencies between the components) of SESs. This
   contrasts with the commonly held view of governance as an external
   intervention applied to a system. To systematically examine the
   recurrent patterns in how the internal dynamics promote/detract from the
   emergence of different types of governance, we applied archetype
   analysis to 60 selected cases of irrigation systems from Asia. Drawing
   inspiration from grid-group typology of cultural theory, we developed
   four specific archetypes: egalitarian, individualist, hierarchical, and
   fatalist. To build these archetypes, we applied a robustness framework
   and several other theories/perspectives to identify the different
   social-ecological and infrastructural attributes of irrigation SESs, and
   their interdependencies and feedback structures. We then used these
   attributes, identified through our theoretical review, to deductively
   code our selected cases and classify them into the different archetypes.
   The results show the different configurations of attributes that

Title = {Managing Wicked Environmental Problems as Complex Social-Ecological
   Systems: The Promise of Adaptive Governance},
Booktitle = {LANDSCAPE DYNAMICS, SOILS AND HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES IN VARIED CLIMATES},
Series = {Springer Geography},
Year = {2016},
Pages = {741-762},
Abstract = {Lessons learned from the failure of rational-comprehensive planning
   approaches to the management of water and other natural resources have
   led to a rethinking of the nature of resource management problems. The
   concept of wicked problems is increasingly used to describe problems
   that lack consensus in terms of their definition and solutions. In line
   with the ongoing search for appropriate conceptual frameworks and
   institutions for managing wicked problems, this chapter argues for a
   reconceptualization of wicked problems as complex social-ecological
   systems. Such a reconceptualization calls for a resilience-based
   approach to managing wicked problems through adaptive governance
   institutions. Adaptive governance provides a multi-level institutional
   framework for managing the uncertainties and conflicts that characterize
   wicked environmental problems. This argument is illustrated using the
   case of the Cache River watershed in southern Illinois, USA.},

Volume = {30},

Pages = {65-69},
Abstract = {Many of the intransigent problems facing the world arise in complex
   systems. In this paper, I propose that communal rangelands in South
   Africa be recognised as complex social-ecological systems and that one
   of the reasons that development initiatives have had little impact on
   improving livelihoods and rangeland condition is that interventions have
   been based on reductionist thinking that has failed to recognise
   non-linearities and uncertainties in the system. This complexity resides
   in ecological, social and economic components of the system, and is
   characterised by dynamics operating at different scales within and
   beyond the boundaries of the rangelands. People and the environment are
   vulnerable to change in these systems from factors such as changing
   climate, economics, governance arrangements, as well as disasters.
   Policy that promotes adaptability and resilience, and is itself
   responsive to changing dynamics, should be sought. Complex systems
   modelling with an inclusive group of stakeholders holds potential for
   realising such policy.},

Abstract = {Elinor Ostrom was a leader in using multiple methods to perform
   institutional analysis. In this paper, we discuss how a multi-method
   approach she pioneered may be used to study the robustness of
   social-ecological systems. We synthesize lessons learned from a series
   of studies on small-scale irrigation systems in which we use case-study
   analysis, experimental methods in laboratory and field settings, and
   mathematical models. The accumulated insights show the importance of
   creating institutional arrangements that fit the human ecology within
   the biophysical constraints of the system. The examples of work based on
   multiple methods approaches presented here highlight several lessons.
   For example, experimental work helps us better understand the details of
   how the ability to maintain trust relationships, low levels of
   inequality, and low transaction costs of coordination are critical for
   success. Likewise, the integration of case-study analysis and modeling
   helps us better understand how systems that can leverage biophysical
   characteristics to help address challenges of monitoring, sanctioning,
   and coordination may be able to increase their chances of success.},

Title = {Past management affects success of current joint forestry management
   institutions in Tajikistan},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {21},
Number = {5},
Pages = {2183-2224},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In the Pamir Mountains of Eastern Tajikistan, the clearance of mountain
   forests to provide fuelwood for an increasing population is a major
   source of environmental degradation. International development
   organisations have implemented joint forestry management institutions to
   help restore once-forested mountainous regions, but the success of these
   institutions has been highly variable. This study uses a multi-method
   approach, drawing on institutional analysis supported by Elinor Ostrom's
   design principles and social-ecological system framework in combination
   with resilience thinking to help understand why some communities in
   Tajikistan manage their forests more sustainably than others. The
   application of the design principles provided helpful guidance for
   practitioners implementing joint forestry management. The
   social-ecological system analysis revealed both `history of use' and
   `tenant density' as positively associated with forest condition.
   However, we also identify limitations of snapshot social-ecological
   assessments. In particular, we illustrate the critical importance of
   considering historical legacy effects, such as externally imposed
   centralised governance regimes (that characterise many post-Soviet
   states) in attempts to understand current management practices. Our work
   shows how a more nuanced understanding of institutional change and
   inertia can be achieved by adopting a resilience approach to
   institutional analysis, focusing on the importance of reorganisation.
   Lessons learned from our analysis should be widely applicable to common
   pool resource management in other semi-arid forested landscapes as well
   as in regions with a strong centralised governance legacy.},

Abstract = {Analysis of social-ecological systems is becoming increasingly used
   since the framework provides a valuable set of variables for
   understanding relationships between people and ecosystems. This
   interaction focuses on the use and management of natural resources that,
   in many cases, are common-pool resources. In Mexico, common-pool
   resources have long been explored since at least 60\% of the forested
   lands in the country are held under the legal figure of `ejidos' and
   indigenous communities, which aimed at driving the collective use of
   lands and resources. However, few studies incorporate ecological
   processes for an integrated understanding of social-ecological systems.
   In this study, we seek to understand how ecological variability
   influences the creation and functioning of different rules and,
   consequently, institutions for forests management. Our case study was
   conducted in an ejido with high ecological variability located in
   Jalisco on the Pacific coast of Mexico. The research approach was
   interdisciplinary and combined qualitative and quantitative methods. We
   conducted participant observation and 23 semi-structured interviews;
   botanical collections were also carried out. We found that there is
   strong influence between ecological variables and the emergence of rules
   and collective action. The most important variables influencing these
   processes were the economic value of resource units, ecosystem services
   perceived by local people and location and size of the resource system
   (including area and number of species). Historical processes also play a
   part that generates knowledge of resource systems and the current
   social, economic and political settings at a larger scale. The
   establishment of relationships with variables that produce certain
   outcomes for the framework of the social-ecological system is an
   important challenge to be met in order to move forward in both theory
   and practice.},

Abstract = {Common pool resources are increasingly examined through
   social-ecological systems (SES) lenses to understand multifaceted
   natural resource issues through interdisciplinary approaches. Using
   frameworks grounded in environmental governance and SES, we examine the
   multijurisdictional institutional network of Kaipara Harbour in New
   Zealand. We find that while the conventional form of regulatory
   management has persisted until recently, the network has been modified
   to a more collaborative and cooperative configuration. We argue that
   although the decision-making capacities of the Kaipara Harbour network
   are unchanged, the emergence of informal and self-organized subsystems
   is vital to the successful management of the harbour. This case
   illustrates the value of combining the governance network framework,
   allowing us to view the material relationships between actors, and the
   SES framework, pressing us to isolate those action arenas with the most
   power, the most legitimacy, and perhaps the more effective role to play
   in stewarding the region's natural resources.},

Abstract = {This study diagnoses temporal and spatial variations in the performance
   of different social-ecological systems (SES) in coastal floodplain
   management in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta. We go beyond common pool
   resource management problems and address the management of local public
   goods. In the assessment, we consider recent developments in the
   framework initially developed by Elinor Ostrom. The main variables of
   the framework that we use are resource systems, the environment, the
   governance system and actors. The focal SES is defined based on guiding
   questions relating to the definition of the key problem, system
   boundaries, and action situations. According to our results, the
   performance of resource systems and the environment deteriorated in
   1960-79 compared to the performance prior to 1960. The condition reached
   a low point during 1980-1999 but improved slightly after 1999. The
   horizontal network structure of local governance was active until 1960.
   Due to the introduction of the `tidal river management' approach in the
   90 s, the performance of the resource system and the environment has
   slightly improved, as has the involvement of government and
   non-government organizations. Our results also show that overall SES
   performance is comparatively better <in the case of locally managed
   floodplains than it is for those managed by government agencies. Our new
   approaches, such as the recent development of the diagnostic framework,
   the guiding questions for defining focal SES, and application of the
   framework to local public goods can potentially be used in the fields of
   sustainability science and SES science. The qualitative performance of
   each of the selected indicators is useful for identifying intervention
   options to achieve a sustainable outcome for the coastal floodplain SES.},

Title = {Environmental variability and collective action: Experimental insights
   from an irrigation game},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {93},
Pages = {166-176},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Studies of collective action in commons dilemmas in social-ecological
   systems typically focus on scenarios in which actors all share symmetric
   (or similar) positions in relation to the common-pool resource. Many
   common social-ecological systems do not meet these criteria, most
   notably, irrigation systems. Participants in irrigation systems must
   solve two related collective action problems: 1) the provisioning of
   physical infrastructure necessary to utilize the resource (water), and
   2) the asymmetric common-pool resource dilemma where the relative
   positions of ``head-enders{''} and ``tail-enders{''} generate asymmetric
   access to the resource itself (water). In times of scarcity, head-enders
   have an incentive to not share water with tail-enders. Likewise,
   tail-enders have an incentive to not provide labor to maintain the
   system if they do not receive water. These interdependent incentives may
   induce a cooperative outcome under favorable conditions. However, how
   robust is this system of interdependent incentives in the presence of
   environmental variability that generates uncertainty about water
   availability either through variation in the water supply itself or
   through shocks to infrastructure? This paper reports on results from
   laboratory experiments designed to address this question. (C) 2013

Title = {Putting machine learning to use in natural resource management improving
   model performance},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {25},
Number = {4},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Machine learning models have proven to be very successful in many fields
   of research. Yet, in natural resource management, modeling with
   algorithms such as gradient boosting or artificial neural networks is
   virtually nonexistent. The current state of research on existing
   applications of machine learning in the field of social-ecological
   systems is outlined in a systematic literature review. For this purpose,
   a short introduction on fundamental concepts of neural network modeling
   is provided. The data set used, a prototypical case study collection of
   social-ecological systems the common pool resources database from the
   Ostrom Workshop is described. I answer the question of whether neural
   networks are suitable for the kind of data and problems in this field,
   and whether they or other machine learning algorithms perform better
   than standard statistical approaches such as regressions. The results
   indicate a large performance gain. In addition, I identify obstacles for
   adapting machine learning and provide suggestions on how to overcome
   them. By using a freely available data set and open source software, and
   by providing the full code, I hope to enable the community to add
   machine learning to the existing tool box of statistical methods.},

Title = {Local perceptions on social-ecological dynamics in Latin America in
   three community-based natural resource management systems},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {20},
Number = {4},
Abstract = {Several examples of community-based natural resource management in Latin
   American social-ecological systems exist in which communities control
   the management of common-pool resources. Understanding community
   perceptions of the performance of these systems is essential to involve
   communities in sustainable management strategies. In this analysis of
   three areas in Colombia, Mexico, and Argentina, we analyzed the local
   perceptions of the social and environmental challenges faced by these
   social-ecological systems and how these challenges and drivers affect
   their resilience. To do this, we combined prospective structural
   analysis to unravel stakeholders' perceptions of each system's
   functioning along with network analysis to assess resilience. We
   identified external variables as the most influential variables in the
   Colombian and Argentine cases. In the Mexican case, larger influence is
   exerted by internal variables, particularly those linked to the
   governance system. The case study analysis revealed that the
   community-based natural resource management approach needs external
   support and recognition to work effectively. In the Argentine and
   Colombian cases, megaprojects were perceived as controllers with medium
   or strong influence but low dependence. The use of ancestral knowledge
   (Colombia), the history of land use (Mexico), and the history of the
   artisanal fishery (Argentina) were all perceived as common challenges to
   community-based natural resource management. In terms of
   social-ecological resilience, framed within the three-dimensional model
   of the adaptive cycle, all three social-ecological systems were
   considered to be highly connected and resilient but with different
   degrees of capacity or cumulative potential.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE COMMONS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {13},

Pages = {747-776},
Abstract = {Privatization is, since Hardin, often promoted as a solution to many
   natural resource management challenges, particularly in common-pool
   resource systems. However, novel forms of privatization are being
   implemented in unexamined ways. In this article we explore how
   privatization affects natural resource management from the perspective
   of multi-dimensional social-ecological systems. We critique the notion
   that privatization is desirable due to its pure efficiency, and argue
   that efficiency must be relative to achieving other normative societal
   goals, in particular, sustainability. While sustainability outcomes
   often cannot be fully actualized, the processes through which
   privatization attempts to achieve them are more tangible criteria.
   First, we draw on (1) distributional and (2) procedural justice as
   normative societal goals to assess effectiveness of different forms of
   privatization. Second, we analyze the broader implications of
   privatization for social-ecological system functioning considering (3)
   path dependency and (4) spillover effects. We apply these four concepts
   to examine three different cases of privatization: eco-certification in
   fisheries, seed patents in agriculture and property rights in
   rangelands. We argue that the evaluative criteria for the success of
   privatization are often oversimplified, and highlight how privatization
   can influence social-ecological systems and the achievement of normative
   goals in largely unexamined ways.},

Abstract = {For exploitation of social-ecological systems, cooperation has been
   considered to be a prerequisite to avoid the tragedy of the commons. As
   was theorized, coupling strategic and ecological dynamics could cause
   social regime shifts when the resource supply is sufficiently abundant.
   Regime shifts indicate the collapse of social cooperation and the loss
   of natural resources. The phenomenon has been demonstrated in an
   integrated society with static complex social networks; however,
   exploiting agents could dynamically switch their partners (i.e., link
   rewiring in social networks) in the real world. In this study, we
   investigate the evolution of cooperation in a coupled social-ecological
   model in which the ecosystem evolves according to the intrinsic rules
   and human extracting strategy, and agents are allowed to either change
   their strategies or switch their partners. Our results show that link
   rewiring has positive and negative effects on the evolution of
   cooperation in the common pool resource game according to both social
   and ecological attributes. Importantly, the partner switching can
   stabilize the cooperation when the resource has high inflow or
   reproductivity. These results broaden our understanding of the
   coevolution of structural, strategic, and ecological dynamics in a
   common pool resource game; the results also illustrate the importance of
   reputation mechanisms in the sustainable development of
   social-ecological systems. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Analyzing different pathways by which social-ecological systems can
   loose resilience and enter trajectories of collapse constitutes an
   important aspect of our quest towards understanding resource
   sustainability. This paper's goal was to better understand the effect of
   a particular class of disturbance-the accumulative effects of routine
   stressors-in the context of marine social-ecological systems. To that
   effect, we built a system dynamics model using empirically collected
   institutional and biological field data of an artisanal fishery in the
   Gulf of California, Mexico. Among our findings, we identified different
   scenarios under which even very small endogenous changes in the
   relationship between ecological and institutional variables can send a
   seemingly resilient system into a trajectory of collapse. We discuss why
   these types of disturbances are so difficult to prevent and be
   identified by the users of the resource, as well as potential strategies
   to address these challenges.},

Abstract = {The theory and practice of adaptive management and adaptive governance
   have been widely studied in the complex social contexts that mediate how
   humans interact with ecosystems. Adaptive governance is thought to
   enable adaptive management in such contexts. In this study, we examine
   four often-used principles of adaptive governance (polycentric
   institutions, collaboration, social learning and complexity thinking) to
   develop a framework for reflecting on adaptive governance of a
   social-ecological system-the Knysna Estuary in South Africa. This
   estuary is a priority for biodiversity conservation, as well as a
   common-pool resource central to livelihoods. We used the framework to
   structure dialogue on the extent to which the four principles of
   adaptive governance were being applied in the management of the Knysna
   Estuary. The dialogue included diverse stakeholders, from those who have
   the power to influence adaptive management to those most dependent on
   the resource for their livelihoods. Based on a combination of theory and
   current reality we then identified eight indicators that could be used
   to guide a transition towards improved adaptive governance of the
   estuary. These indicators were assessed and supported by most
   stakeholders. The main contributions of our research are (a) a process
   for combining theory and stakeholder dialogue to reflect on adaptive
   governance of a social-ecological system; (b) a set of indicators or
   conditions that emerged from our participatory process that can be used
   for reflexive monitoring and adaptation of adaptive governance of Knysna
   Estuary; and (c) a real-world example of seeking complementary links
   between adaptive governance and adaptive management to promote effective
   management of complex social-ecological systems.},

Abstract = {The ongoing global and large-scale changes in markets, demographics, and
   use of resources are impacting mountain peoples and regions. In mountain
   areas, resources have been governed through community-based systems for
   resource management for centuries, ensuring stewardship and local
   decision-making over the resources. Due to the importance of such
   systems to mountain societies, there is a need to understand local
   effects of global changes and reconfigure community-based resource
   management (CRM) to meet local needs while tackling global challenges.
   Changes include biodiversity loss and the climate crisis, as well as
   increasing social and economic disparities. Studies on the role of
   knowledge cocreation in the process of CRM innovation in response to
   ongoing changes in mountain social-ecological systems are missing. This
   study aimed to explore the reconfigurations that enable CRM to foster
   sustainable development and thriving communities. The study focused on
   an intervention promoting community entrepreneurship in community-based
   tourism for the revitalization of collective resources in 2 mountain
   communities in Northern Italy. We adopted a transdisciplinary approach
   and a research action methodology to codesign the interventions and
   research. Data from focus groups, a survey, participatory activities,
   interviews, and participant observation were collected and analyzed
   using a qualitative content analysis method. Results show that emerging
   reconfigurations in CRM include recognition of new values and uses of
   collective resources, inclusion of new stakeholders, and innovation of
   the organizational model, shifting the perspective from resource
   management to resource governance. The study recommends striking a
   balance between pushing innovation and increasing power imbalances. It
   is important to pay attention to the inclusivity of the process and to
   avoid excessive commodification of resources.},

Abstract = {What makes social-ecological systems (SESs) robust? In this paper, we
   look at the institutional configurations that affect the interactions
   among resources, resource users, public infrastructure providers, and
   public infrastructures. We propose a framework that helps identify
   potential vulnerabilities of SESs to disturbances. All the links between
   components of this framework can fail and thereby reduce the robustness
   of the system. We posit that the link between resource users and public
   infrastructure providers is a key variable affecting the robustness of
   SESs that has frequently been ignored in the past. We illustrate the
   problems caused by a disruption in this link. We then briefly describe
   the design principles originally developed for robust common-pool
   resource institutions, because they appear to be a good starting point
   for the development of design principles for more general SESs and do
   include the link between resource users and public infrastructure
   providers.},

Journal = {ECOLOGICAL COMPLEXITY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {13},
Pages = {46-52},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The growing demand for ecological resources puts pressure on many
   ecosystems and, in extreme cases, threatens the long-term survival of
   the associated social-ecological system. The sustainable use of
   resources helps to avoid the collapse of the system, but requires the
   balancing of two conflicting aims: the preservation of resource
   productivity and the provision of satisfactory returns. Although humans
   can consider expected future pay-offs in decision-making, the inherent
   variability of ecological resources makes future returns uncertain and
   complicates the determination of sustainable harvest behaviours. We
   present here an adaptive model in which human harvest behaviour is
   linked to a renewable resource with a randomly fluctuating growth rate.
   In the model, users adjust their harvest behaviour following a trade-off
   between the potential current harvest and the discounted future
   productivity of the resource. Our analyses reveal that rising resource
   variability increases the discount factor required for a sustainable
   harvest and reduces long-term pay-offs. A high discount factor,
   indicating certain future returns, makes the user-resource system robust
   against resource fluctuations albeit at the cost of a lowered maximum
   total harvest. By considering the user-resource system as a single
   co-evolving entity, our approach allows for the determination of
   sustainable harvest strategies in randomly fluctuating environments. (C)

Abstract = {A major problem worldwide is the potential loss of fisheries, forests,
   and water resources. Understanding of the processes that lead to
   improvements in or deterioration of natural resources is limited,
   because scientific disciplines use different concepts and languages to
   describe and explain complex social-ecological systems (SESs). Without a
   common framework to organize findings, isolated knowledge does not
   cumulate. Until recently, accepted theory has assumed that resource
   users will never self-organize to maintain their resources and that
   governments must impose solutions. Research in multiple disciplines,
   however, has found that some government policies accelerate resource
   destruction, whereas some resource users have invested their time and
   energy to achieve sustainability. A general framework is used to
   identify 10 subsystem variables that affect the likelihood of
   self-organization in efforts to achieve a sustainable SES.},

Abstract = {Governance is increasingly recognized as key to sustainability and human
   wellbeing in mountain social-ecological systems (MtSES). Mountains
   present particular challenges for effective governance related to their
   geographic complexities, status as commons, susceptibility to
   environmental change, and impacts of external political and
   socioeconomic processes. This study reports on the results of a global
   survey of local mountain governance. It explored a range of known
   governance challenges to discover which are most prevalent and whether
   relative strength of local governance helps to mitigate these
   challenges. The study analyzed 75 survey responses across 5 continents
   from researchers and practitioners who work on mountain governance.
   Major challenges for governance included contradictory policies,
   poverty, and the presence of valuable nonrenewable natural resources.
   Compared with sites with stronger local governance, those with weaker
   arrangements reported significantly greater prevalence of certain
   challenges, such as corruption. Yet many challenges did not differ
   significantly by strength of local governance, implicating external
   factors instead. This finding points to a need to improve governance
   across levels to support MtSES sustainability.},

Abstract = {We conceptualize social-ecological systems (SESs) as complex adaptive
   systems where public policy affects and is affected by the biophysical
   system in which it is embedded. The study of robustness of SESs combines
   insights from various disciplines including economics, political
   science, ecology, and engineering. In this paper we present an approach
   that can be used to explore the implications for public policy when
   viewed as a component of a complex adaptive system. Our approach
   leverages the Institutional Analysis and Development framework to
   provide a platform for interdisciplinary research that focuses on
   system-wide outcomes of the policy process beyond just policy change.
   The main message is that building robustness can create new
   vulnerabilities. Fail-free policies cannot be developed, and instead of
   a focus on the ``right{''} policy, we need to think about policy
   processes that stimulate experimentation, adaptation, and learning.},

Abstract = {Given increased pressure on natural resources to deliver benefits,
   complex trade-offs and the regulation of behaviours in relation to
   benefits is of key concern. Behaviours that signify resistance to the
   rules according to which benefits are allocated prompt us to consider
   causal links and feedbacks between benefits, perceptions of benefits,
   meanings attached to the benefits, and the regulatory instruments that
   mediate the distribution of benefits. An understanding of how meanings
   influence the perception of benefits exposes the complexity inherent in
   how people perceive and allocate value to natural resource benefits.
   Meanings are personal, sometimes overlapping, context dependent and
   variable across space and time. A challenge in directing resource user
   behaviour in common pool resources is that the relationship between the
   resource and resource use is typically not interpreted to include the
   manner in which users associate resource benefits with meanings. We
   propose that collective ordering of meanings and associated rules help
   to direct behaviours and in doing so they contribute to the purposeful
   maintenance of desirable elements of a social-ecological system (i.e.
   robustness). Using an example, we illustrate how tensions around benefit
   sharing are rooted in the emergence and changing prioritisation of
   contexts and meanings over time. The importance of eliciting, ordering
   and sanctioning of meanings is emphasised. We conclude by discussing the
   implications for robustness and benefit sharing in social-ecological
   systems and we comment on the usefulness and limitations of the
   framework.},

   management, but rarely if ever has been operationalized for multiple

   the case of small-scale fisheries in Baja California Sur, Mexico, to
   identify distinct SES regions and test key aspects of coupled SESs
   theory. Regions that exhibit greater potential for social-ecological
   sustainability in one dimension do not necessarily exhibit it in others,
   highlighting the importance of integrative, coupled system analyses when

Title = {Implementing a social-ecological systems framework for conservation
   monitoring: lessons from a multi-country coral reef program},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {240},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Multi-scale social-ecological systems (SES) approaches to conservation
   and commons management are needed to address the complex challenges of
   the Anthropocene. Although SES approaches to monitoring and evaluation
   are advocated in global science and policy arenas, real-world
   applications remain scarce. Here, we describe the first
   operationalization and implementation of Ostrom's influential SES
   framework for monitoring practice across multiple countries. Designed to
   inform management aimed at sustaining coral reefs and the people that
   depend on them, we developed our SES monitoring framework through a
   transdisciplinary process involving academics and practitioners with
   expertise in social and ecological sciences. We describe the SES
   monitroing framework, including how it operationalizes key insights from
   the SES and program evaluation literatures, and demonstrate how insights
   from its implementation in more than 85 communities in four countries
   (Fiji, Indonesia, Kenya and Madagascar) are informing decision-making at
   multiple levels. Responding to repeated calls for guidance on applying
   SES approaches to monitoring and management practice, we outline the key
   steps of the transdisciplinary development of the framework and lessons
   learnt. Therefore, our work contributes to bridging the gap between SES
   science and commons management practice through not only providing an
   SES monitoring framework that can be readily applied to coral reefs and
   other commons, but also through demonstrating how to operationalize SES
   approaches for real-world monitoring and management practice.},

Title = {Characterization of an artisanal fishery in Argentina using the
   social-ecological systems framework},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE COMMONS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-69},
Abstract = {Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) studies how institutions
   (the rules of the game of a society) determine the performance of a
   social-economic system. Elinor Ostrom extends the institutional analysis
   to the collective action for a particular case, the study of the
   social-ecological systems (SESs) (Ostrom 1990). Any group that attempts
   to manage a common resource (e.g. aquifers, pastures) for optimal
   sustainable production must solve a set of problems in order to create
   institutions to facilitate collective action. Some evidences show that
   following a set of design principles in creating institutions can lead
   to overcome these problems. The aim of the paper is to apply the SES
   framework to an artisanal fishery community in Argentina in order to: 1)
   describe the principal features, key variables and relations of the
   small-scale fishery system; 2) detect the principal drivers of a
   potential common-management and the leading detractors from the current
   communal performance; and 3) analyze the possibility that a
   self-governing for sustainable fishery may appear. Several drivers for
   potential common-management and some detractors from the current common
   performance are summarized. Artisanal fishery SES is currently at a
   bifurcation point. A common historical and cultural root, the presence
   of leaderships, the relevance of local knowledge, the dependence on the
   resource to sustainable livelihoods and the threat of big-scale
   fisheries area have generated incentives to collectiveaction. But,
   simultaneously, internal conflicts are the most important barrier for an
   integrated community-based management. The heterogeneity among actors
   and the relevant external conditions have resulted in two groups
   diverging in their self-organization. The work is framed by the project
   COMET-LA (COmmunity-based Management of Environmental challenges in
   Latin America; European Commission's Seventh Framework Programme of
   Research and Development), which aims to identify sustainable
   community-based governance for the management of natural resources that
   can be used in different social-ecological systems in a context of
   climate change and increasing competition in the use of resources.},

Title = {The Role of Common-Pool Resources' Institutional Robustness in a
   Collective Action Dilemma under Environmental Variations},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {24},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Extreme environmental variations, as a phenomenon deriving from climate
   change, led to an exacerbated uncertainty on water availability and
   increased the likelihood of conflicts regarding water-dependent
   activities such as agriculture. In this paper, we investigate the role
   of conflict resolution mechanisms-one of Ostrom's acclaimed Design
   Principles-when social-ecological systems are exposed to physical
   external disturbances. The theoretical propositions predict that
   social-ecological systems with conflict-resolution mechanisms will
   perform better than those without them. We tested this proposition
   through a framed field experiment that mimicked an irrigation system.
   This asymmetric setting exposed farmers to two (2) dilemmas: (i) how
   much to invest in the communal irrigation system's maintenance and (ii)
   how much water to extract. The setting added a layer of complexity:
   water availability depended not only on the investment but also on the
   environmental variability. Our findings confirmed the theoretical
   proposition: groups with stronger `institutional robustness' can cope
   with environmental variations better than those with weaker robustness.
   However, we also found that some groups, despite lacking
   conflict-resolution mechanisms, were also able to address environmental
   variations. We explored potential explanatory variables to these
   unexpected results. We found that subjects' and groups' attributes might
   address uncertainty and avert conflict. Thus, social-ecological systems'
   capacity to respond to external disturbances, such as environmental
   variations, might not only be a question of Design Principles. Instead,
   it might also be strongly related to group members' attributes and group
   dynamics. Our results pave the way for further research, hinting that
   some groups might be better equipped for mitigation measures, while
   others might be better equipped for adaptation measures.},

Abstract = {External drivers increasingly impact small-scale fisheries worldwide. As
   globalization accelerates the flow of information, commodities, and
   capital across geographic space, neoliberal reforms have fueled the
   development of the international seafood trade. Small-scale fisheries
   traditionally driven by local forces and market demands are increasingly
   nested within the broader structures of global markets and international
   institutions. Building on existing work that integrates
   social-ecological systems thinking and critical social science theory,
   we address how globalization has transformed the social fabric of
   coastal fishing communities and consider the implications for
   institutional and environmental integrity. Using small-scale fisheries
   across the Gulf of California as an empirical example, we extend a
   theory of small-scale fisheries interactions proposed by development
   scholars to incorporate global market forces, considering how drivers
   operating at multiple temporal and geographic scales have influenced
   outcomes in one of the world's most diverse and productive marine
   ecosystems. We suggest that neoliberal reforms promoting the growth and
   development of an export-oriented seafood industry have restructured the
   relationships between small-scale fishermen, coastal communities, and
   the marine environment. As the benefits of trade liberalization have
   been captured by local elites, small-scale fishermen have been left
   increasingly vulnerable to the shocks and uncertainties associated with
   political, economic, and environmental change. By situating our findings
   within an emerging body of scholarship documenting parallel dynamics
   across diverse geographies, we argue that efforts to avoid and/or
   mitigate the tragedy of the commons within small-scale fishery systems
   must address the relationships between global markets, social and
   economic inequality, and local capacities for self-organization and
   collective action.},

Title = {The Land-Water-Food Nexus: Expanding the Social-Ecological System
   Framework to Link Land and Water Governance},
Journal = {RESOURCES-BASEL},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {6},
Number = {3},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {To date, the land-water-food nexus has been primarily addressed from an
   ecological, hydrological or agronomic angle, with limited response to
   the governance interface between the input resources. Likewise, in
   widely used heuristic frameworks, such as the social-ecological system
   (SES) framework, governance interactions between resources are not
   sufficiently addressed. We address this gap empirically, using the case
   of Tajikistan, based on a farm household survey analysis of 306 farmers.
   The results indicate that land system variables contribute to the
   willingness to cooperate in irrigation management. Specifically, formal
   land tenure has a positive effect on farmers paying for water as well as
   on the likelihood of their investing time and effort in irrigation
   infrastructure, which is decisive for Tajikistan's food and fiber
   production. Irrigation system variables show that, e.g., being an
   upstream user increases the likelihood to contribute to labor
   maintenance efforts. We further discuss how decisions with respect to
   the land sector could be designed in the future to facilitate
   cooperation in other resource sectors. Further, we conclude from a
   conceptual perspective that the SES framework integrating a nexus
   perspective can be adapted: either (1) by adding a second-tier
   governance nexus variable inside the governance variable of an
   irrigation system; or (2) by adding a land resource unit and system
   outside the irrigation system.},

Abstract = {This paper applies a participatory approach in evaluating small-scale
   fisheries, focusing on the Arapaima gigas fishery in the Brazilian
   Amazon. The evaluation uses the social-ecological system (SES)
   framework, adopted to explain the conditions needed for sustainability
   and user cooperation in natural resources management, as a more suitable
   alternative to the `blueprint' or `panaceas' approaches, based only on
   property rights or governmental intervention. However, managers and
   users often do not have the necessary information compiled and available
   for a specific SES while some actions need to be taken immediately.
   Thus, consensus and negotiation among stakeholders about SES variables
   may be useful to evaluate system performance and indicate actions to
   promote sustainability. In the case study, using a consensus-building
   model, we found that arapaima SES leads to sustainability and is far
   from being a case of `tragedy of the commons.' More investments in
   suitable monitoring and enforcement for adaptive management are
   recommended. Adopting an SES framework based on stakeholders' prospects
   may be useful until complete interdisciplinary studies become available
   so as to seek of sustainability in the long term.},

Abstract = {Contemporary environmental challenges call for new research approaches
   that include the human dimension when studying the natural environment.
   In spite of the recent development of several conceptual frameworks
   integrating human society with nature, there has been less
   methodological and theoretical progress on how to quantitatively study
   such social-ecological interdependencies. We propose a novel theoretical
   framework for addressing this gap that partly builds on the rapidly
   growing interdisciplinary research on complex networks. The framework
   makes it possible to unpack, define and formalize ways in which
   societies and nature are interdependent, and to empirically link this to
   specific governance challenges and opportunities using a range of
   theories from both the social and natural sciences in an integrated way.
   At the core of the framework is a set of basic building blocks (motifs)
   that each represents a simplified but non-trivial social-ecological
   systems (SES) consisting of two social actors and two ecological
   resources. The set represents all possible patterns of interdependency
   in a SES. Each unique motif is characterized in terms of social and
   ecological connectivity, resource sharing, and resource
   substitutability. By aligning theoretical insights related to the
   management of common-pool resources, metapopulation dynamics, and the
   problem of fit in SES with the set of motifs, we demonstrate the
   multi-theoretical ability of the framework in a case study of a rural
   agricultural landscape in southern Madagascar. Several mechanisms
   explaining the inhabitants' demonstrated ability to preserve their
   scattered forest patches in spite of strong pressures on land and forest
   resources are presented. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Tracing environmental and livelihood dynamics in a tropical coastal
   lagoon through the lens of multiple adaptive cycles},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {25},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Understanding the long-term dynamics of social-ecological systems is
   critical to better inform sustainable management. Since Holling's
   adaptive cycle heuristic, published in 2001, substantial progress has
   been made to explore historical changes in agricultural, pastoral, and
   forest systems. However, the application of this heuristic in coastal
   fishery systems has been relatively rare. Using the Tam Giang Lagoon in
   Vietnam as an example of a rapidly changing environment, we explore the
   historical behavior of this tropical coastal social-ecological system
   (SES), associated livelihood pathways, and possible challenges for
   future livelihood adaptations through the lens of the adaptive cycle
   metaphor. Our analysis demonstrates that the present lagoon SES
   condition is the result of a series of historical events and
   reorganization attempts through two complete adaptive cycles. The
   lagoon's future vulnerability is tied to the intensification of human
   uses, prolonged ecological degradation, and intensifying climatic
   hazards. We show how the evolution of the lagoon SES resulted in
   divergent livelihood pathways that bring benefits to some users but also
   cause persistent constraints and sometimes irreversible losses to other
   users in shared common pool resources. A one-size-fits-all fishery
   management approach is therefore ill-suited for improving diverse
   livelihoods. We recommend that fishery policies take seriously the
   heterogeneity in livelihood pathways for sustainable lagoon management.
   We end by reflecting on the usefulness of the adaptive cycle heuristic
   in systematically exploring historical dynamics and identifying
   underlying drivers and feedbacks between the social and ecological
   components of complex fishery systems.},

Volume = {32},

Abstract = {Much is known about disaster mitigation (DM) actions, but little is
   known about the impact of migration as an exogenous shock. Rural farmers
   in mountainous areas are under the pressure of poverty, and also face
   the threat of geo-hazards. Therefore, a more complex relationship exists
   between rural farmers' willingness to out-migration for work and their
   DM behavior. To gain insight into the relationship between the two, we
   constructed the social-ecological system (SES) framework based on the
   survey data of 864 households in 53 villages in Chongqing, and verified
   our findings using the endogenous switching regression model and the
   mediation effect model. The results show that labor out-migration has a
   negative correlation with the DM behavior of peasant households. When
   the total effect is further categorized into the direct effect and
   mediation effect; the negative total effect of labor out-migration on
   the DM of farmers changes from a significant to an insignificant
   negative direct effect. It can be seen that labor out-migration is not
   the direct cause of low motivation for DM, but the loss of leadership
   caused by labor out-migration, the dilution of farmers' sense of place,
   and the decline of farmers' risk perception are the causes that
   ultimately lead to the decline of farmers' action ability for DM. This
   study confirms that the SES framework is suitable for empirical research
   on how labor out-migration affects the ability of local villages to
   ensure DM action. These findings add new theoretical insights to the
   literature on DM.},

Title = {Exploring non-linear transition pathways in social-ecological systems},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2020},

Month = {MAR 5},
Abstract = {Tipping point dynamics are fundamental drivers for sustainable
   transition pathways of social-ecological systems (SES). Current research
   predominantly analyzes how crossing tipping points causes regime shifts,
   however, the analysis of potential transition pathways from these social
   and ecological tipping points is often overlooked. In this paper, we
   analyze transition pathways and the potential outcomes that these may
   lead to via a stylized model of a system composed of interacting agents
   exploiting resources and, by extension, the overall ecosystem.
   Interactions between the social and the ecological system are based on a
   perception-exploitation framework. We show that the presence of tipping
   points in SES may yield counter-intuitive social-ecological transition
   pathways. For example, the high perception of an alarming ecological
   state among agents can provide short-term ecological benefits, but can
   be less effective in the long term, compared to a low-perception
   condition. This work also highlights how understanding non-linear
   interactions is critical for defining suitable transition pathways of
   any SES.},

Title = {Measuring squid fishery governance efficacy: a social-ecological system
   analysis},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE COMMONS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {12},
Number = {2},
Pages = {21-57},
Abstract = {As finfish fisheries increasingly shrink due to overexploitation,
   management and industry have shifted their attention to the world's
   squid fisheries. The emergence of squid fisheries in the global seafood
   market calls for well-designed and effective management strategies if
   they are to remain viable. This study assesses the efficacy of squid
   governance from a social-ecological perspective in three fisheries. This
   analysis uses an evidence-based approach to characterize the
   social-ecological system variables that contribute to each fishery
   management system meeting its stated goals. To do so, I test the
   hypothesis that the presence of the ten institutional design principles
   formulated by common pool resource theory leads to more effective squid
   fishery management. I measure five outcome variables (governance system
   effect, commons condition trend, basin switch, user group well-being,
   compliance) to assess governance effectiveness from social and
   ecological perspectives. This is the first attempt to examine the design
   principles and operationalize Ostrom's Social-Ecological System
   framework to compare globally competitive squid fisheries. Results
   indicate that each of the three analyzed squid governance systems has
   met its specified management goals and is associated with positive
   social and ecological outcomes. Using the Socio-Ecological Systems
   Meta-Analysis Database (SESMAD), I used secondary data supplemented with
   semi-structured interviews with key informants to find a strong presence
   of the design principles in each case. Findings suggest effective squid
   governance is associated with user-involvement in system operations and
   contextually appropriate policies, rather than a single overarching
   squid based strategy.},

Abstract = {Community forestry in rural Mexico presents a unique opportunity to
   study the linkages and feedback within coupled social-ecological systems
   due to the fact that agrarian or indigenous communities control
   approximately half of the national territory of Mexico. We used social
   and ecological diagnostic tools to develop a fire management strategy
   for a communal forest containing an endemic pinon pine species, Pinus
   cembroides subs. orizabensis, in the state of Tlaxcala, Mexico. The
   ecological diagnostic was done through fuel inventory, forest structure
   sampling, and fire behaviour modelling. The social assessment was
   conducted through household interviews, community workshops, and direct
   participant observation. The ecological fire hazard was quantified and
   coupled with the social assessment to develop a fire management plan.
   Vertical fuel continuity and flashy surface fuels created a high fire
   hazard. Modelled fire behaviour showed a rapid rate of spread and high
   flame lengths under multiple scenarios. Relative impunity for starting
   forest fires, poor community and inter-agency organisation, and lack of
   project continuity across organisational sectors appear to be the most
   significant social limiting factors for wildfire management. Combining
   both social and ecological diagnostic tools provides a comprehensive
   understanding of the actual risks to forests, and identifies realistic
   community-supported options for conservation on cooperatively managed
   lands.},

Title = {Drivers of innovation in groundwater governance. The links between the
   social and the ecological systems},
Journal = {LAND USE POLICY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {91},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Global groundwater overexploitation positions groundwater governance as
   a critical issue for improving sustainable water management. Evidence of
   aquifer recovery after overexploitation is scattered, as is the research
   on the drivers behind recovery. The Fuencaliente Aquifer in Spain faced
   a tragedy of the commons situation, but after an innovative governance
   arrangement was implemented, the aquifer is gradually recovering. In
   this research, we identify the drivers that made possible the emergence
   and acceptance of such an arrangement using the social-ecological system
   framework. We identified external drivers such as market incentives and
   limited enforcement capacity of the water authority as the main factors
   that led to groundwater depletion, but we also found that these same
   drivers, under a new regulatory framework that reinforced monitoring and
   sanctioning capacities, are the basis for the effective recovery of the
   aquifer. Internal drivers such as the socioeconomic attributes of the
   users, their limited collective action and the power differences between
   traditional and commercial farmers are also critical in explaining the
   acceptance of the new governance arrangement. Even if these drivers are
   context-specific, we identified innovations that might be transferable
   and contribute to the literature on good practices in groundwater
   governance and management.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on self-organizing processes in contested urban
   social-ecological systems. It analyzes a wetland conservation program
   and civic management effort in the Angachilla sector of the city of
   Valdivia, Chile in a 15-year time frame. The aim is to understand what
   triggers collective actions and self-organization in the attempts of
   preserving an urban green common. The study uses a qualitative approach
   based on action-research methodologies. It examines key variables
   influencing self-organizing processes; including social-environmental
   crises, governance vacuums, wetland valuation, and leadership. It also
   discusses collective strategies for the transformation of negative
   feedback loops, such as norms and regulations detrimental to wetland
   protection, and those related to resistance to change of wetland surface
   area due to unregulated urbanization. From an Urban Green Commons
   perspective, this work illustrates the complexity of dealing with
   contested nature, making it a resource difficult to govern collectively
   given all the different interests and values in place. It also shows
   that there have been successful periods of active wetland management
   that have influenced active democratic processes regarding land use and
   land use change in the city.},

Title = {Which infrastructures for which forest function? Analyzing
   multifunctionality through the social-ecological system framework},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {25},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Landscapes are subject to ecological and socioeconomic forces of change
   that interact in complex ways. To cope with these changes, landscape
   planning of natural resource management integrates sociocultural,
   ecological, and economic considerations in an analytic and systemic way.
   In this regard, social-ecological system (SES) frameworks have been
   developed to help analyze key factors that drive the dynamics of such
   complex adaptive systems. For forests, multifunctional management, which
   also highlights the ecological and socioeconomic roles of forests for
   society, has become a central objective for several European countries
   (e.g., France, Italy, and Germany). However, further development of
   methods, tools, and conceptual approaches is needed to facilitate our
   understanding of the arrangements behind management practices that
   include complex human-environment interactions. This study adopts
   Ostrom's SES framework and Anderies' robustness framework to highlight
   how forestry institutions affect forest ecosystems, forest functions,
   and social arrangements. As an illustration, we apply both frameworks to
   the Quatre-Montagnes forest, located in the south-east of France, in
   which multifunctionality is a major objective of forest governance. We
   first apply the SES framework to construct an analysis of the
   Quatre-Montagnes forest, specifying the first-tier and second-tier
   variables. From this, we describe the importance of
   infrastructure-related variables in shaping the interactions between
   components of the SES. We then apply the robustness framework, developed
   by Anderies, because we believe this framework enables a better analysis
   of ecosystem functions for infrastructure governance than the SES
   framework, which provides a better descriptive capacity for the
   variables. We discuss insights, based on our infrastructure analysis,
   which can be used when establishing designs for efficient forest
   management with heavy infrastructure dependencies.},

Title = {Social roles and performance of social-ecological systems: evidence from
   behavioral lab experiments},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {20},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {Social roles are thought to play an important role in determining the
   capacity for collective action in a community regarding the use of
   shared resources. Here we report on the results of a study using a
   behavioral experimental approach regarding the relationship between
   social roles and the performance of social-ecological systems. The
   computer-based irrigation experiment that was the basis of this study
   mimics the decisions faced by farmers in small-scale irrigation systems.
   In each of 20 rounds, which are analogous to growing seasons,
   participants face a two-stage commons dilemma. First they must decide
   how much to invest in the public infrastructure, e.g., canals and water
   diversion structures. Second, they must decide how much to extract from
   the water made available by that public infrastructure. Each round
   begins with a 60-second communication period before the players make
   their investment and extraction decisions. By analyzing the chat
   messages exchanged among participants during the communication stage of
   the experiment, we coded up to three roles per participant using the
   scheme of seven roles known to be important in the literature: leader,
   knowledge generator, connector, follower, moralist, enforcer, and
   observer. Our study supports the importance of certain social roles
   (e.g., connector) previously highlighted by several case study analyses.
   However, using qualitative comparative analysis we found that none of
   the individual roles was sufficient for groups to succeed, i.e., to
   reach a certain level of group production. Instead, we found that a
   combination of at least five roles was necessary for success. In
   addition, in the context of upstream-downstream asymmetry, we observed a
   pattern in which social roles assumed by participants tended to differ
   by their positions. Although our work generated some interesting
   insights, further research is needed to determine how robust our
   findings are to different action situations, such as biophysical
   context, social network, and resource uncertainty.},

Title = {Strategic behaviors and governance challenges in social-ecological
   systems},
Journal = {EARTHS FUTURE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {5},

Abstract = {The resource management and environmental policy literature focuses on
   devising regulations and incentive structures to achieve desirable
   goals. It often presumes the existence of public infrastructure that
   actualizes these incentives and regulations through a process loosely
   referred to as `governance.' In many cases, it is not clear if and how
   such governance infrastructure can be created and supported. Here, we
   take a complex systems view in which `governance' is an emergent
   phenomenon generated by interactions between social, economic, and
   environmental (both built and natural) factors. We present a framework
   and formal stylized model to explore under what circumstances stable
   governance structures may emerge endogenously in coupled infrastructure
   systems comprising shared natural, social, and built infrastructures of
   which social-ecological systems are specific examples. The model allows
   us to derive general conditions for a sustainable coupled infrastructure
   system in which critical infrastructure (e.g., canals) is provided by a
   governing entity that enables resource users (e.g., farmers) to produce
   outputs from natural infrastructure (e.g., water) to meet their needs
   while supporting the governing entity.
   Plain Language Summary To understand how successful and robust
   governance may arise in coupled infrastructure systems comprising shared
   natural, social, and built infrastructure, we develop a stylized model
   based on a widely used conceptual framework that focuses on robustness
   of social-ecological systems. Analysis of the model results in
   conditions for sustainability of such systems that are expressed as
   clear relationships between biophysical and social factors. The results
   lay groundwork for more rigorous studies of robustness and resilience of
   these complex systems.},

Title = {Fluid hunter motivation in Central Africa: Effects on behaviour,
   bushmeat and income},
Journal = {PEOPLE AND NATURE},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUL 16},
Abstract = {Individual motivation for the rural use of common-pool resources (CPRs)
   can be fluid, with the line between subsistence and commercial often
   unclear and in flux. Implications of fluid motivation are understudied
   yet important for social-ecological systems (SESs), such as bushmeat
   hunting throughout Central Africa that is essential to local
   protein/nutrition, income and culture. Making locally informative
   predictions of multiple SESs nested within a landscape-scale SES has
   been historically difficult, but community-driven participatory
   approaches provide new kinds and quantities of data, opening previously
   inaccessible doors for research and governance. We apply hierarchical
   Bayesian structural equation modelling to a novel dataset of 910 hunts
   from 111 gun and trap hunters across nine villages in Gabon, generated
   in a participatory process whereby hunters conducted GPS self-follows in
   conjunction with paraecologist surveys of their motivation, behaviour
   and offtake. We (i) establish the human behaviour driving gun-hunting
   and trapping success and predict its effect on offtake across villages
   and (ii) link fluid motivation of gun hunters to their behaviour, number
   of animals hunted, biomass yielded and income earned. Gun hunts across
   villages yielded more animals during the night than the day, and when
   hunters brought high amounts of ammunition and walked far distances from
   villages. Gun hunts were less successful when coupled with trapping
   while per-hunt success of trapping itself was generally low and
   difficult to predict. Fluid gun hunters hunted fewer animals when
   motivated strictly by subsistence, despite no reduction in ammunition
   brought or distance walked, while offtake from strictly commercial
   versus mixed motivation was the same. Numbers of animals hunted, biomass
   and income were tightly linked. We discuss the implications of these
   results for the ecological sustainability of hunting and participatory
   forecasting in bushmeat research and policy. Read the free Plain

Title = {Designing and implementing payments for ecosystem services programs:
   Lessons learned from China's cropland restoration experience},
Journal = {FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {35},
Number = {SI},
Pages = {66-72},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Payments for ecosystem services (PES) have attracted broad international
   attention as a novel approach of using economic incentives to address
   the loss of valuable ecosystem services. However, there has been
   inadequate work investigating the basic question of how to design and
   execute a PES program, and the limited inquiries have rarely been
   pursued in the diagnostic framework for studying social-ecological
   systems (SES). This paper aims to fill these critical knowledge gaps. We
   first introduce the SES framework into the context of PES in general and
   ecological restoration in particular and then highlight the progress and
   challenges of China's large initiative of converting degraded cropland.
   Next, we deliberate the essential lessons that can be learned from
   China, as reflected in the multi-faceted, complex processes of
   interactions and outcomes of the initiative from the ecological,
   socioeconomic, and institutional perspectives. We hope that these
   efforts will convey some important and timely policy messages, which
   will contribute to advancing the science and practice of PES-based
   ecological restoration and nature conservation. (C) 2013 Published by

Abstract = {The goal of this paper is to improve our understanding of the role of
   institutional arrangements and ecological factors that facilitate the
   emergence and sustainability of successful collective action in
   small-scale fishing social-ecological systems Using a modified logistic
   growth function, we simulate how ecological factors (i e carrying
   capacity) affect small-scale fishing communities with varying degrees of
   institutional development (i.e. timeliness to adopt new institutions and
   the degree to which harvesting effort is reduced), in their ability to
   avoid overexploitation Our results show that strong and timely
   institutions are necessary but not sufficient to maintain sustainable
   harvests over time The sooner communities adopt institutions, and the
   stronger the institutions they adopt, the more likely they are to
   sustain the resource stock Exactly how timely the institutions must be
   adopted, and by what amount harvesting effort must be diminished,
   depends on the ecological carrying capacity of the species at the
   particular location Small differences in the carrying capacity between
   fishing sites, even under scenarios of similar institutional
   development, greatly affects the likelihood of effective collective

   enable outcomes of those systems? The high concentration of lake
   organizations in northern USA enables us to study social, institutional,

   performed an in-depth comparative study of thirty-one lake organizations
   in Vilas County, Wisconsin using data collected through semi-structured
   interviews, websites, and agency databases. We systematically compared
   the cases using crisp-set qualitative comparative analysis, specifically
   analyzing how the eight Ostrom institutional design principles lead to
   different outcomes for the lake social-ecological systems. The Ostrom
   institutional design principles played an important role in SES
   governance outcomes where there was low-resource dependence. We found
   that different combinations of design principles, social, and ecological
   conditions led to the same lake SES outcomes-equifinality. Although we
   expected that there were no panaceas for lake governance, we were
   surprised by the high diversity in organizational goals and the relative
   low diversity of rules in use.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING \& SOFTWARE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {115},
Pages = {19-37},

Abstract = {The modelling of social-ecological systems can provide useful insights
   into the interaction of social and environmental processes. However,
   quantitative social-ecological models should acknowledge the complexity
   and uncertainty of both underlying subsystems. For example, the
   agent-based models which are increasingly popular for groundwater
   studies can be made more realistic by incorporating geohydrological
   processes. Conversely, groundwater models can benefit from an
   agent-based depiction of the decision-making and feedbacks which drive
   groundwater exploitation. From this perspective, this work introduces a
   Python-based software architecture which couples the NetLogo agent-based
   platform with the MODFLOW/SEAWAT geohydrological modelling environment.
   This approach enables users to design agent-based models in NetLogo's
   user-friendly platform, while benefiting from the full capabilities of
   MODFLOW/SEAWAT. This workflow is illustrated for a simplified
   application of Aquifer Thermal Energy Storage (ATES).},

   heterogeneous actors, these commons social-ecological systems often face
   internal and external threats or disturbances. The institutional
   arrangements may be effective with problems that are internal to a
   social-ecological system - ones that they are designed to handle, but
   how do these arrangements cope with external disturbances, especially
   ones caused by large-scale political and economic decisions, events, and
   processes. Using ethnographic and archival data we conduct an
   institutional analysis outlining the existing and emerging
   collaboratives, the important actors, and ongoing efforts to cope with
   the five major challenges identified by rangeland actors. We trace the
   evolution of institutions on the western range with a focus on their
   ability to cope with challenges that are largely within the system -
   biodiversity, fire, and water management, and those that are driven
   externally by actors who are largely absent - border militarization and
   violence and exurbanization.},

Title = {Everyday resilience: Rural communities as agents of change in peatland
   social-ecological systems},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {96},
Pages = {316-331},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The ability to maintain livelihoods in the face of major environmental,
   political, economic and social stresses is fundamental to building
   resilient social and ecological communities. This research examines the
   place com-munity has in this challenge and specifically the role of
   community involvement in the conservation of peatland social-ecological
   systems. It explores transformative change at local levels and the
   relational networks, diverse economies and range of resources
   communities draw on to achieve this change. Evidence is drawn from a
   survey, interviews and three case studies of rural community groups in
   the Irish midlands to provide an overview of local dynamics in peatland
   conservation and wider issues of place-based development and adaptation.
   Drawing on theoretical insights from resilience, resourcefulness and
   diverse economies scholarship, this research reveals the role of local
   communities in both adapting to, and enacting, change through everyday
   forms of resilience that are commonplace and ubiquitous in people's
   lives yet often invisible and under-valued. Thematic areas are
   identified which provide insights into how communities are: engaging in
   diverse work practices that foster ecological livelihoods and planetary
   well-being; co-creating community science projects through local
   networks and multi-level partnerships; and developing management and
   stewardship cultures that emphasise collaboration, co-operation and the
   commons. This research will help actors at a variety of scales to plan
   and implement more collaborative and inclusive research and restoration
   programs for peatland conservation. It also has relevance for regions
   with landscapes in transition that seek to initiate equitable community
   capacity-building programs and diverse economies in the shift from
   extractive to regenerative land use. These transitions will require
   investment and resources both for ecosystem restoration and the
   relational networks that are so crucial to the work of building the
   collaborative communities, cultures and economies of the future.},

Title = {A social-ecological systems framework for food systems research:
   accommodating transformation systems and their products},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE COMMONS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {9},
Number = {2},
Pages = {881-908},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The social-ecological systems (SES) framework was developed to support
   communication across the multiple disciplines concerned with sustainable
   provision and/or appropriation of common-pool resources (CPRs).
   Transformation activities (e.g. processing, distribution, retailing) in
   which value is added to resource units appropriated from CPRs were
   assumed in developing the framework to be exogenous to the SES of focal
   concern. However, provision and appropriation of CPRs are nowadays often
   closely integrated with the market economy, so significant
   interdependence exists between many CPR provision/appropriation
   activities and the activities in which appropriated resource units are
   transformed into the products ultimately marketed or consumed. This
   paper presents a modified version of the SES framework designed to
   better account for transformation activities in order to be more
   suitable for diagnosing those sustainability problems where it is
   inappropriate to define all such activities as exogenous to the SES of
   focal concern. The need for such modification was identified in a
   research project examining the challenges faced by Cambodian
   cattle-owning smallholders in accessing value chains for premium-priced
   beef. Hence the immediate focus was on strengthening the SES framework's
   value for facilitating a multi-disciplinary diagnostic approach to food
   system research projects of this kind. The modified SES framework's
   potential in this respect was illustrated by a preliminary application
   that drew on literature reviewed for the Cambodian project. Significant
   further potential exists in using the modified framework as a foundation
   from which to develop a version that is suitable for application to SESs
   in which transformation systems are appropriately represented as
   endogenous. Maintaining consistency with the standard SES framework will
   enable communication to occur more effectively between food system
   researchers and CPR scholars more generally.},

Title = {Robustness, vulnerability, and adaptive capacity in small-scale
   social-ecological systems: The Pumpa Irrigation System in Nepal},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {15},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {Change in freshwater availability is arguably one of the most pressing
   issues associated with global change. Agriculture, which uses roughly
   70\% of the total global freshwater supply, figures prominently among
   sectors that may be adversely affected by global change. Of specific
   concern are small-scale agricultural systems that make up nearly 90\% of
   all farming systems and generate 40\% of agricultural output worldwide.
   These systems are experiencing a range of novel shocks, including
   increased variability in precipitation and competing demands for water
   and labor that challenge their capacity to maintain agricultural output.
   This paper employs a robustness-vulnerability trade-off framework to
   explore the capacity of these small-scale systems to cope with novel
   shocks and directed change. Motivated by the Pumpa Irrigation System in
   Nepal, we develop and analyze a simple model of rice-paddy irrigation
   and use it to demonstrate how institutional arrangements may, in
   becoming very well tuned to cope with specific shocks and manage
   particular human interactions associated with irrigated agriculture,
   generate vulnerabilities to novel shocks. This characterization of
   robustness-vulnerability trade-off relationships is then used to inform
   policy options to improve the capacity of small-scale irrigation systems
   to adapt to changes in freshwater availability.},

Abstract = {Irrigation is key for agricultural production and public affairs in
   China. Canal irrigation has been the dominant form of irrigation in
   China for over two thousand years, but this is changing dramatically in
   contemporary China. Official government data and observational studies
   prove that canal irrigation has sharply declined in China in the past
   several decades. This paper explores the causes and influences
   associated with this decline. We use the social-ecological systems (SES)
   framework to diagnose the causes of the decline of canal irrigation and
   identify the significant influences on it. The broader contextual
   variables of industrialisation, urbanisation, policy, marketisation and
   technological progress influence resource systems, farmers and
   governance systems, which, in turn, have jointly led to the decline of
   canal irrigation. This study also considers the economic, social and
   ecological consequences of such a shift in irrigation pattern. The
   decline of canal irrigation may be inevitable in the transformation from
   a rural to a modern society. However, we must be aware of its costs and
   risks. To maintain the effectiveness of rural irrigation during the
   transformation to a modern society, we propose three implications of the
   decline of canal irrigation.},

Title = {A systematic review of factors influencing self-governed public open
   spaces: insights from social-ecological system framework and collective
   action},
Journal = {OPEN HOUSE INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 APR 5},
Abstract = {Purpose - Due to the influence of complex and intersecting factors,
   self-governed public open spaces (POSs) (managed by local communities)
   are subject to collective action dilemmas such as tragedy of the commons
   (overexploitation), free-riding, underinvestment and mismanagement. This
   review paper adopts a multi-dimensional and multi-tier social-ecological
   system (SES) framework proposed by McGinnis and Ostrom, drawing on
   collective action theory to explore the key
   institutional-social-ecological factors that impact POS self-governance.
   Design/methodology/approach - In this paper, Preferred Reporting Items
   for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) was utilized to
   systematically screen and review the relevant literature for the period
   from 2000 to 2023 in three databases: Web of Science, Scopus and Google
   Scholar. A total of 57 papers were chosen for in-depth analysis.
   Findings - The literature review identified and categorized several
   variables associated with the self-organizing system of POS;
   consequently, an SES-based POS management framework was developed for
   the first time, consisting of 114 institutional-social-ecological
   sub-variables from different dimensions and three levels. Compared to
   ecological factors, among others, governance organizations,
   property-rights systems, socioeconomic attributes and actors' knowledge
   of SES have been commonly and primarily studied. Research
   limitations/implications - There is still room for the refinement of the
   conceptual SES-based POS collective action framework over the time (by
   adding in new factors), and indefinitely empirical research validating
   those identified factors is also worth to be undertaken, particularly
   testing how SES factors and interaction variables affect the POS quality
   (collective action). Originality/value - The findings of this study can
   provide local policy insights and POS management strategies based on the
   identification of specific SES factors for relevant managers. Moreover,
   this research makes significant theoretical contributions to the
   integration of the SES framework and collective action theory with POS
   governance studies.},

Title = {Ecological restoration in Tibet optimises the cognitive structures of
   stakeholders on social-ecological systems},
Journal = {PEOPLE AND NATURE},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 AUG 31},
Abstract = {Facing the dual threats of climate and socioeconomic changes, how Tibet
   can seize the opportunity for ecological restoration to enhance
   environmental quality while improving the relationship between humans
   and nature is of great significance for regional sustainable
   development.Situated in an ecologically vulnerable area, the cognitive
   structure of Tibetan residents regarding resources and policies is a
   crucial reference for evaluating whether environmental governance is
   sustainable. We aimed to detect what impact ecological restoration in
   Tibet had on the cognitive structures of stakeholders.We distributed
   questionnaires to Tibetan residents, distinguished experimental groups
   (EG, n = 325) and control groups (CG, n = 165) by the implementation of
   ecological restoration projects or not, used a network approach to
   construct indicators of overall connectivity and evenness for assessing
   the cognitive structure and explored the influencing factors on
   cognitive structures. We found that interviewees in areas where
   ecological restoration was implemented had more positive perceptions of
   the importance of ecosystem services, the relationship between
   ecological conservation and well-being, attitudes towards ecological
   restoration, and the impact of governance measures. The overall
   connectivity and evenness of the EG were significantly higher than those
   of the CG. It showed an increase in positive stakeholder perceptions
   about policy and nature and a greater emphasis on the balance between
   environmental protection and productive life. The implementation of
   ecological restoration enhanced the connection between local people and
   the environment. Elevation and annual precipitation were the geographic
   influencing factors that dominated overall connectivity.Based on the
   cognitive structure of Tibetan residents, the implementation of
   ecological restoration enhanced connections in social-ecological systems
   elements, played a positive role in the human-nature relationship and
   promoted collective governance of common pool resources. Safeguarding
   and improving residents' livelihoods and enhancing the regional
   low-connectivity cognitive structure under different geographical
   contexts are important for future governance.Read the free Plain

Title = {A review of the social-ecological systems framework: applications,
   methods, modifications, and challenges},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {23},
Number = {4},
Abstract = {The social-ecological systems framework (SESF) is arguably the most
   comprehensive conceptual framework for diagnosing interactions and
   outcomes in social-ecological systems (SES). This article systematically
   reviews the literature applying and developing the SESF and discusses
   methodological challenges for its continued use and development. Six
   types of research approaches using the SESF are identified, as well as
   the context of application, types of data used, and commonly associated
   concepts. The frequency of how each second-tier variable is used across
   articles is analyzed. A summary list of indicators used to measure each
   second-tier variable is provided. Articles suggesting modifications to
   the framework are summarized and linked to the specific variables. The
   discussion reflects on the results and focuses on methodological
   challenges for applying the framework. First, how the SESF is
   historically related to commons and collective action research. This
   affects its continued development in relation to inclusion criteria for
   variable modification and discourse in the literature. The framework may
   evolve into separate modified versions for specific resource use sectors
   (e.g., forestry, fisheries, food production, etc.), and a general
   framework would aggregate the generalizable commonalities between them.
   Methodological challenges for applying the SESF are discussed related to
   research design, transparency, and cross-case comparison. These are
   referred to as ``methodological gaps{''} that allow the framework to be
   malleable to context but create transparency, comparability, and data
   abstraction issues. These include the variable-definition gap,
   variable-indicator gap, the indicator-measurement gap, and the data
   transformation gap. A benefit of the framework has been its ability to
   be malleable and multipurpose, bringing a welcomed pluralism of methods,
   data, and associated concepts. However, pluralism creates challenges for
   synthesis, data comparison, and mutually agreed-upon methods for
   modifications. Databases are a promising direction forward to help solve
   this problem. In conclusion, future research is discussed by reflecting
   on the different ways the SESF may continue to be a useful tool through
   (1) being a general but adaptable framework, (2) enabling comparison,
   and (3) as a diagnostic tool for theory building.},

Title = {Regime shifts in a social-ecological system},
Journal = {THEORETICAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {6},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {359-372},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Ecological regime shifts are rarely purely ecological. Not only is the
   regime shift frequently triggered by human activity, but the responses
   of relevant actors to ecological dynamics are often crucial to the
   development and even existence of the regime shift. Here, we show that
   the dynamics of human behaviour in response to ecological changes can be
   crucial in determining the overall dynamics of the system. We find a
   social-ecological regime shift in a model of harvesters of a common-pool
   resource who avoid over-exploitation of the resource by social ostracism
   of non-complying harvesters. The regime shift, which can be triggered by
   several different drivers individually or also in combination, consists
   of a breakdown of the social norm, sudden collapse of co-operation and
   an over-exploitation of the resource. We use the approach of generalized
   modeling to study the robustness of the regime shift to uncertainty over
   the specific forms of model components such as the ostracism norm and
   the resource dynamics. Importantly, the regime shift in our model does
   not occur if the dynamics of harvester behaviour are not included in the
   model. Finally, we sketch some possible early warning signals for the
   social-ecological regime shifts we observe in the models.},

Title = {Factors driving the implementation of fishery reforms},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {71},
Pages = {222-228},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The challenges of common-pool resource harvesting have confronted the
   world's fisheries for centuries. Efforts, to mitigate these challenges
   have led to an extensive literature on fishery performance under
   alternative management practices, but relatively little evidence exists
   on the factors that drive the adoption of these management approaches.
   In this study, a database describing 67 fishery cooperatives around the
   world is analyzed to help fill this gap. The analysis is focused on two
   widely implemented catch share management strategies, Territorial Use
   Rights Fisheries and Individual Quotas. Our empirical approach and
   interpretation of results are organized according to Ostrom's
   social-ecological systems framework. Among the evaluated factors,
   governance aspects appear to be most important to management adoption,
   specifically the presence of legal conditions on cooperative existence,
   and the strength of law and stability of governing institutions. It is
   postulated that the same factors that favor adoption of specific catch
   share management strategies would also generally play a positive role in
   their performance. If this is true, our results highlight the importance
   of considering both sets of factors when trying to spread the
   implementation of management tools, and show that enabling conditions
   associated to existing governance structures deserve great emphasis by
   those who seek to adopt management strategies like catch shares. (C)

Title = {Hyper-extractive counties in the US: A coupled-systems approach},
Journal = {APPLIED GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {37},
Pages = {88-100},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {In this paper, we advance a theoretical framework for defining
   hyper-extractive coupled-systems in the United States. Our purpose is to
   extend a model constructed for an agricultural system in Southwest
   Kansas into a general theory that can be used to successfully classify
   counties across the U.S. that depend on the extraction of natural
   resources. We begin with developing the theoretical foundations for the
   hyper-extractive coupled-system. We then fit this theory within the
   existing literature regarding the classification of rural counties.
   Finally, drawing on a coupled human-natural systems theoretical
   framework (Liu et al., 2007), we develop a new spatially based empirical
   measure of rural context that captures the complex, multidimensional
   interactions between humans and their natural environments. GIS hot spot
   and factor analytic techniques are used to empirically identify existing
   coupled-systems, linking contiguous counties in the rural U.S. based on
   35 indicators of land use, employment patterns, demographics,
   physiography, and climate. In addition to identifying three different
   types of hyper-extractive counties across the U.S., our approach reveals
   a number of other coupled-systems based on agriculture and ranching,
   mining, manufacturing, scenic amenities, and forestry and fishing. (c)

Abstract = {Efforts to confront the challenges of environmental change and
   uncertainty include attempts to adaptively manage social-ecological
   systems. However, critical questions remain about whether adaptive
   management can lead to sustainable outcomes for both ecosystems and
   society. Here, we make a contribution to these efforts by presenting a
   16-y analysis of ecological outcomes and perceived livelihood impacts
   from adaptive coral reef management in Papua New Guinea. The adaptive
   management system we studied was a customary rotational fisheries
   closure system (akin to fallow agriculture), which helped to increase
   the biomass of reef fish and make fish less wary (more catchable)
   relative to openly fished areas. However, over time the amount of fish
   in openly fished reefs slowly declined. We found that, overall, resource
   users tended to have positive perceptions about this system, but there
   were negative perceptions when fishing was being prohibited. We also
   highlight some of the key traits of this adaptive management system,
   including 1) strong social cohesion, whereby leaders played a critical
   role in knowledge exchange; 2) high levels of compliance, which was
   facilitated via a ``carrot-and-stick{''} approach that publicly rewarded
   good behavior and punished deviant behavior; and 3) high levels of
   participation by community actors.},

Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS},

Volume = {88},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {With the escalating uncertainties and surprises faced in responding to
   environmental and natural resource challenges has come growing
   recognition of the need to manage such issues as social-ecological
   systems and value the capacities that enable adaptation to these
   changes. Adaptations in environmental management often involve complex,
   including wicked, problems of collective action. Institutions introduced
   to reduce the transaction costs of solving these problems do not come
   for free.
   A cost effectiveness framework designed to provide a comprehensive and
   logical structure for economic evaluation of path dependent
   institutional choices in this context, and a procedure for boundedly

Title = {Factors influencing collective action of gated communities: a systematic
   review using an SES framework},
Journal = {OPEN HOUSE INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {48},

Abstract = {Purpose Within a gated community, management of common property presents
   great challenges. Therefore, the diagnostic social ecological system
   (SES) framework proposed by Elinor Ostrom providing a holistic
   understanding of complex collective action problems in terms of
   management of commons is used to investigate key
   institutional-social-ecological factors influencing collective action in
   the context of gated communities. Design/methodology/approach In this
   paper, Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
   Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) was used to systematically screen and review the
   relevant literature from 2000 to 2022, where 28 papers were selected for
   further analysis. Findings The study systematically identifies and
   categorises a series of variables related to self-organizing management
   in the gated community, and consequently a SES-based gated community
   management framework is developed. Based on the conceptual framework,
   the paper discusses logical interrelationships of
   institutional-social-ecological factors and their impacts on collective
   action performance of gated communities. Research
   limitations/implications Apart from requiring empirical validation, the
   conceptual SES-based gated community management framework is certainly
   subject to continuous improvement in terms of refinement and addition of
   other potential determinants of gated community collective action.
   Originality/value Not only the review paper provides updates on the
   latest gated-community collective action research, it also contributes
   theoretically by conceptualizing the SES framework and its
   institutional-social-ecological design principles in gated community
   management. Studying these factors should also be of practical
   significance because the findings ultimately offer policy insights and
   management strategies that help policy-makers, property developers and
   local communities to govern such neighbourhood common resources
   efficiently and sustainably.},

Volume = {9},

Pages = {184-206},
Abstract = {Urban commons constitute important social-ecological systems for the
   resilience of cities of the Global South. However, rapid urbanization
   has led to large-scale degradation and transformation of several
   commons, impacting the resilience of traditional and vulnerable users.
   Gunda thopes (hereafter `thopes') are wooded groves that constitute
   important yet neglected peri-urban commons of Bengaluru city in southern
   India. Traditionally used and managed by local communities, these thopes
   as urban commons provided a range of ecosystem services. Thopes
   supported traditional livelihoods and subsistence use by local
   communities, urban poor and migrants and were central to the cultural
   lives of local residents. Urbanization has resulted in changes to the
   status, use, management and perceptions of thopes with significant
   degradation in the last three decades contributing to declining
   ecosystem services. This paper examines the loss of ecological and
   social resilience, especially for marginalized residents, when ecosystem
   services of urban commons decline owing to urbanization.},

Abstract = {Protected areas (PAs) are social-ecological systems (SES) and are
   contested spaces. The challenges in governing PAs call for a governance
   system that works with human-nature relations and is capable of adapting
   to each PA. This necessitates innovative processes and adaptive
   governance. This paper contributes to the discussion on adaptive
   governance in SES by offering empirical evidence from Costa Rica on how
   the processes of social innovation occur in practice. We discuss the
   evolving governance of the Juan Castro Blanco National Water Park,
   particularly the contribution of a local association that drives
   conservation and management of the park. We show that social
   mobilisation caused social innovation, which was revealed by the
   achievement of three interconnected process outcomes: satisfaction of
   interests; effective socio-political arrangements; and empowerment. The
   socially-innovative governance of the park has contributed to
   sustainability and to social-ecological change at many levels.},

   social-ecological system},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {21},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {New methods have emerged for testing common-pool resource theory in
   large-scale environmental governance contexts. We aim to contribute to
   that scholarship by assessing the relevance of Elinor Ostrom's design
   principles in the lower Mekong basin (LMB). The recent dam-building
   trend in the LMB has revealed a trade-off between hydropower development
   and the conservation of migratory fish species. The need to internalize
   or avoid the negative externalities of hydropower dam construction poses
   a new challenge to the LMB governance system and its main management
   body, the Mekong River Commission. Our objective was to explain the
   emergence of the trade-off and the capacity of the governance system to
   address it. Elinor Ostrom's design principles and other variables
   provided by the Socio-ecological Systems Meta-analysis Database were
   first coded with regard to secondary data and then tested against the
   capacity for cooperation of the LMB governance system. The lack of
   sanctioning despite a strong monitoring system, and the existence of
   fuzzy governance boundaries in the context of a powerful outsider like
   China, were particularly relevant to understanding the current
   cooperation stalemate in the basin. Other variables such as scientific
   knowledge, triggering events, markets, resource spatial heterogeneity,
   and heterogeneity of interests were also relevant.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE COMMONS},

Volume = {5},
Number = {2},
Pages = {410-432},
Abstract = {Globalization increases the vulnerability of traditional
   social-ecological systems (SES) to the incursion of new resource
   appropriators, i.e. intruders. New external disturbances that increase
   the physical and socio-political accessibility of SES (e.g. construction
   of a new road) and weak points in institutional SES of valuable
   common-pool resources are some of the main factors that enhance the
   encroachment of intruders. The irrigation system of the northwest Murcia
   Region (Spain) is an example used in this article of the changes in the
   structure and robustness of a traditional SES as a result of intruders.
   In this case study, farmers have traditionally used water from springs
   to irrigate their lands but, in recent decades, large agrarian companies
   have settled in this region, using groundwater to irrigate new lands.
   This intrusion had caused the levels of this resource to drop sharply.
   In an attempt to adapt, local communities are intensifying the use of
   resources and are constructing new physical infrastructures;
   consequently, new vulnerabilities are emerging. This situation seems to
   be heading toward the inevitably collapse of this traditional SES. From
   an institutional viewpoint, some recommendations are offered to enhance
   the robustness of SES in order to mitigate the consequences of
   intruders.},

   fisheries: Case implementation and sustainability assessment in Southern
   California},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},

Volume = {114},
Pages = {204-217},

Abstract = {Fisheries exemplify the immense complexity of interactions in
   social-ecological systems (SESs). This complexity has created management
   challenges and raises concerns for the sustainability of our marine
   natural resource systems. This article contributes to SES fisheries
   research and management in two ways: first, it enhances our
   understanding of lobster fisheries as complex social-ecological systems,
   focusing on the Southern California Spiny Lobster Fishery (SCSLF) as a
   case study. Secondly, it demonstrates a methodological approach for
   assessing component interactions in SESs that can be used to assess the
   sustainability of management approaches. The first contribution involves
   the systematic review of the literature on lobster fisheries management
   and their SES characteristics. The review results are then used to
   modify and extensively define the diagnostic SES framework for specific
   use in lobster fisheries. For the second contribution, we demonstrate
   how to operationalize the modified framework for the diagnosis of a
   real-life case, using the SCSLF as an example. This involves framing the
   SCSLF classificatory diagnosis for analysis of the stakeholder-comprised
   management group of the SCSLF as a social-ecological action situation.
   This analysis is aided by the Institutional Analysis and Development
   (IAD) framework, a SES-imbedded tool used in our case to assess
   sustainability in resource management systems through critical analysis
   of stakeholder and resource system interactions. More generally, we find
   that research in lobster fisheries could benefit from broadening its
   scope of analysis, as overly narrow research foci have worked to limit
   the production of more holistic SES knowledge. Our exemplary analysis of
   the LAC's management of the SCSLF shows that the SES contains multiple
   components which have been associated with sustainable outcomes
   elsewhere; however, the fishery still faces many obstacles, including
   how to adapt to future challenges. Our results contribute to developing
   a holistic methodological approach for operationalizing SES framework
   research into practical fisheries management. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {21},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {Understanding the specific relationships between ecological and
   socioeconomic conditions and marine tenure is likely to contribute to
   successful functioning of self-governance institutions for common-pool
   resources. Complex interrelationships of factors influencing fishing
   activities of coastal communities and implementation of customary marine
   tenure over their waters can be represented in a Bayesian belief network
   model. We developed a Bayesian belief network model that includes the
   links between factors for fishing communities in the Kei Islands in
   Indonesia, based on indepth local surveys. Our results showed that the
   cumulative impacts of multiple factors on key social, economic, and
   environmental outcomes can be much larger than the impact from a single
   source, which implies that management or policy intervention could be
   more effective when addressing multiple factors simultaneously. The
   local community's perception of fish stock abundance trends was the
   single most important factor influencing social, economic, and
   environmental outcomes of their community-based management system. The
   frequency of which outsiders were sighted in territorial waters was
   strongly (negatively) linked to weak or strong implementation of a
   customary tenure (Sasi) and the occurrence of intervillage and
   intravillage conflict. Ecological variables also drive these conflicts,
   which illustrates the close connection between ecological and social
   outcomes, and the importance of considering social-ecological systems as
   a whole.},

Abstract = {Natural resources are vulnerable to over-exploitation in the absence of
   effective management. However, norms, enforced by social ostracism, can
   promote cooperation and increase stock biomass in common-pool resource
   systems. Unfortunately, the long-term sustainable use of a resource is
   not assured even if cooperation, maintained by ostracism and aimed at
   optimizing resource use, exists. Here, using the example of fisheries,
   we show that for a cooperative to be maintained by ostracism over time,
   it often must act inefficiently, choosing a `second-best' strategy where
   the resource is over-harvested to some degree. Those cooperatives that
   aim for maximum sustainable profit, the ``first-best{''} harvest
   strategy, are more vulnerable to invasion by independent harvesters,
   leading to larger declines in the fish population. In contrast,
   second-best strategies emphasize the resistance to invasion by
   independent harvesters over maximizing yield or profit. Ultimately, this
   leads to greater long-run payoffs to the resource users as well as
   higher resource stock levels. This highlights the value of pragmatism in
   the design of cooperative institutions for managing natural resources.},

Title = {Lessons learned from synthetic research projects based on the Ostrom
   Workshop frameworks},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {A generalized knowledge of social-ecological relationships is needed to
   address current environmental challenges. Broadly comparative and
   synthetic research is a key method for establishing this type of
   knowledge. To date, however, most work on social-ecological systems has
   applied idiosyncratic methods to specific systems. Several projects,
   each based on the frameworks developed by Elinor Ostrom and colleagues,
   stand out for their application of consistent methods across a broad
   range of cases. In this paper we compare seven of these projects and
   draw conclusions regarding their potential benefits and the challenges
   that scholars can expect in conducting this type of research. The two
   main challenges that we identified are (1) the collective-action
   dilemmas that collaborators face in producing and maintaining the social
   and technical infrastructure that is needed for such projects; and (2)
   balancing complexity and comparability in the structure of the databases
   used and the associated methods for characterizing complex
   social-ecological cases. We discuss approaches for meeting these
   challenges, and present a guiding checklist of questions for project
   design and implementation to provide guidance for future broadly
   comparative research.},

Title = {Community forest and mushrooms: Collective action initiatives in rural
   areas of Galicia},
Journal = {FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {135},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Galicia is a region situated in the northwest of the Iberian Peninsula
   where community forests are very much spread. This kind of ownership is
   held by local communities that, collectively, decide how to manage the
   forest and its mycological resources as part of its non-timber forest
   products. In this work, we characterize and analyse the existing
   governance modalities for the collective use of mycological resources in
   both their material and immaterial aspects, and we do it by applying a
   social-ecological system framework combined with a knowledge economy
   model. Up to 21 mycological use initiatives have been identified and
   inventoried. Most of them manage the common resource through mycological
   reserves (open or closed), but there are others that produce and sell
   mushrooms. The work shows how communities use their governance
   mechanisms to define rules aimed at improving sustainability and the
   influx of revenues. In addition, we analyse how some of these
   initiatives are starting to manage their common immaterial resources
   (associated with values such as quality and with eco-certifications,
   etc.), and to develop innovative strategies (short supply chains) for
   the purpose of improving their position in the value chain. The text
   discusses community management as a strategy that allows combining
   sustainability objectives in the management of mycological resources
   with the raising of revenues in the long term. Finally, we underline the
   need for public policies that support successful experiences and
   strengthen the capacity of community institutions to appropriate the
   value they generate.},

Title = {Disturbances, robustness and adaptation in forest commons: Comparative

Journal = {FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {58},
Number = {SI},
Pages = {56-64},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Exposure to disturbances of different nature and scale can represent a
   threat for the survival of rural communities but also a stimulus to
   adjustment. Disturbance, robustness and adaptation are here examined
   through the lens of Forest Commons, as a typical institution, developed
   by communities in the southeastern Alps since several centuries. The
   paper relies on Commons' theory and further developments and carries out
   a historically-embedded analysis of disturbances, robustness and
   adaptation in Forest Commons of Slovenia and Veneto (Italy). Data have
   been drawn from multiple sources, following an approach based on an area
   scale and later on case-studies. The analysis focuses on evidence of
   Forest Commons' reactions to disturbances induced by political changes
   and State actions. Ostrom's design principles are used to test
   robustness of eight selected cases and identification of their
   adaptation patterns. The paper concludes by confirming Forest Commons as
   robust and adaptive social-ecological systems and thus useful in
   Community Forestry conceptualisation. However, thanks to its
   cross-border analysis, it also points out future research needs for
   their better understanding. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Assessment of Ostrom's social-ecological system framework for the
   comanagement of small-scale marine fisheries in Colombia: from local
   fishers' perspectives},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {25},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Fishery resource management under extractive production models in the
   Anthropocene has contributed to the collapse of fish stocks, threatening
   the food and livelihood security of many people, especially fishers.
   Common-pool resource theory has established the relevance of the design
   principles of Elinor Ostrom, which favor collective actions for the
   management of these resources. With the help of small-scale fishers, we
   assessed the state of Ostrom's principles in the study system to
   determine the conditions required to implement fishery comanagement in
   the future. The communities of Taganga (Caribbean coast) and Tumaco
   (Pacific coast), Colombia, served as case studies because of their known
   dependence on fishing and because both communities are currently facing
   a social-ecological crisis within their top-down administrative
   frameworks. We performed six hearings, three in each community in 2009,
   2012, and 2014, in which fishers brainstormed about the weaknesses that
   are closely related to Ostrom's social-ecological system framework.
   Additionally, 14 focus groups with 119 fishers (31 in Taganga in 2015;
   88 in Tumaco in 2017) were conducted, one for each major fishing method
   used in each community. The obtained results made it possible to
   establish a community vision on the condition of the principles in each
   community, and the principles were prioritized by the fishers do
   determine which ones need immediate attention. The inhabitants of both
   Taganga and Tumaco expressed the urgent need to establish clear
   biophysical limits among resource users, to gain the participation of
   all actors involved, and to build nested enterprises. In particular, the
   community of Tumaco considered monitoring resources and regulations,
   establishing graduated sanctions, and recognizing basic rights to be
   priorities. Furthermore, future opportunities and conflicts related to
   fishery comanagement implementation were evident in both communities.
   Therefore, our results indicate that Taganga and Tumaco are not yet
   ready to implement fishery comanagement. Nevertheless, they have the
   knowledge and motivation to overcome the obstacles that prevent them
   from moving forward with managing their fishery resources and to face
   the tragedy of the commons.},

Title = {Governance of alluvial aquifers and community participation: a
   social-ecological systems analysis of the Brazilian semi-arid region},

Abstract = {Small and shallow alluvial aquifers in arid and semi-arid regions
   compose an important water system that smallholder farmers rely on for
   irrigation and livestock feeding. Geological settings and the small
   scale of these aquifers suggest the need for governance at the local
   level, but research supporting its development is still scarce. Treating
   a case of alluvial aquifers exploited by smallholder farmers located in
   the Brazilian semi-arid region as a common pool resource (CPR), this
   paper analyses the governance of a social-ecological system (SES) for
   which an alluvial aquifer is an essential source of water. The paper
   applies the SES Framework to analyse the SES in light of Ostrom's
   principles for sustainable CPR management to answer the questions: (1)
   can the governance arrangements support sustainable common pool resource
   management of the alluvial aquifers? (2) what opportunities are there to
   make the management of the aquifer more sustainable through
   community-based governance? (3) can Ostrom's design principles lead the
   transition to more sustainable governance of alluvial aquifers? Despite
   a water policy aiming for decentralisation and participatory governance,
   gaps in the implementation of these policies are identified. Taking into
   account the challenges imposed by the aquifer characteristics to impact
   efficient groundwater exploitation, equity in water distribution and
   conservation of the CPR, the analysis reveals opportunities to improve
   CPR management by supporting the community to increase participation in
   the governance of the aquifer in coordination with existing policies.
   This work concludes with suggestions that could empower community
   progress towards more sustainable governance of the aquifer.},

Abstract = {Freshwater salinity is rising across many regions of the United States
   as well as globally, a phenomenon called the freshwater salinization
   syndrome (FSS). The FSS mobilizes organic carbon, nutrients, heavy
   metals, and other contaminants sequestered in soils and freshwater
   sediments, alters the structures and functions of soils, streams, and
   riparian ecosystems, threatens drinking water supplies, and undermines
   progress toward many of the United Nations Sustainable Development
   Goals. There is an urgent need to leverage the current understanding of
   salinization's causes and consequences -in partnership with engineers,
   social scientists, policymakers, and other stakeholders -into locally
   tailored approaches for balancing our nation's salt budget. In this
   feature, we propose that the FSS can be understood as a common pool
   resource problem and explore Nobel Laureate Elinor Ostrom's
   social-ecological systems framework as an approach for identifying the
   conditions under which local actors may work collectively to manage the
   FSS in the absence of top-down regulatory controls. We adopt as a case
   study rising sodium concentrations in the Occoquan Reservoir, a critical
   water supply for up to one million residents in Northern Virginia (USA),
   to illustrate emerging impacts, underlying causes, possible solutions,
   and critical research needs.},

Title = {Collective identity and resilience in the management of common pool
   resources},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE COMMONS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {6},
Number = {2},
Pages = {344-362},
Abstract = {Effective management of common pool resources through collective action
   is dependent upon the efforts of the resources users to establish an
   identity that is held collectively. It is widely accepted that the term
   common pool resources implies a resource that is common to a `pool' of
   people, the resource users. Their interests in the resource connect
   users and potential users, and we propose that the more strongly they
   identify with the resources and commit to act collectively, the stronger
   the collective action. Achieving sustainable use of common pool
   resources is thus determined by the interplay between collective
   identity and collective action. But collective identity as defined by
   the resource and its users is dynamic, making the identity vulnerable in
   directing the behaviour of users. In this paper, we draw on collective
   identity and resilience theories to develop a framework for exploring
   the role of collective identity in understanding collective action in
   the management of common pool resources. We suggest that two key
   attributes of collective identity - identification and affective
   commitment, provide the premise for interpreting, tracking and directing
   change in collective identity. We interpret how the interactions between
   the two attributes contribute to resilience of common pool resources as
   complex social-ecological systems.},

Title = {Designing local institutions for cooperative pest management to underpin
   market access: the case of industry-driven fruit fly area-wide
   management},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE COMMONS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Pages = {176-199},
Abstract = {Area-wide management of mobile pests offers advantages over
   uncoordinated farm-by-farm efforts through increased effectiveness of
   pest control and by reducing the need for pesticides. The literature
   about area-wide pest management focuses predominantly on the technical
   aspects of these programs, but tends to neglect the importance of social
   and institutional aspects. In this article the eight design principles
   for robust common-pool resource institutions are applied to
   industry-driven area-wide pest management. Three case studies are
   compared to gain insight about the social and institutional aspects that
   affect the success of these undertakings. These cases are focused on
   Queensland Fruit Fly control to underpin market access. Growers face a
   particular challenge to gain support from town residents, as backyard
   fruit trees can be pest breeding spots. The paper illustrates that
   social aspects - such as heterogeneous incentives, social capital and
   the ratio between town residents and main beneficiary growers -
   influence the ease of which the design principles can be applied. Market
   access opportunities impact the ratio of cost and benefits to different
   participants. The paper concludes that disconnecting the technical
   aspects of successful programs from the social and institutional aspects
   in which they are embedded can create unrealistic expectations in
   socially different regions that intend to replicate these programs.},

   harvesting seasons},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL COMPLEXITY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {40},
Number = {B, SI},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Water governance remains a challenge for human societies, especially
   when the variation in resource inflow is large and the resource users
   are heterogeneous. We analyze with a coupled social-ecological systems
   (SES) model how socioeconomic and environmental changes affect the
   resilience of social norms governing resource use. In our model, agents
   have access to water as a common-pool resource and allocate it between
   rainy and dry seasons. While it is socially optimal to save water for
   the dry season, it is individually optimal to take water immediately. In
   our model, punishment of norm violators is the mechanism that may
   sustain cooperation. We show that the resilience of social norms could
   be affected by changes in socioeconomic and environmental conditions.
   Particularly, we find that social norms may collapse in times of
   resource scarcity and variability, especially if several drivers act in
   concert. Finally, we find that user heterogeneity in the form of
   different skills and inequality in land endowments may undermine
   cooperation. This implies that climatic changes and increased inequality
   - both potential drivers in the field - may affect community resilience
   and may lead to an erosion of social norms.},

Year = {2016},
Volume = {19},

Abstract = {Novel approaches to natural resource management, particularly those
   which promote stakeholder participation, have been put forward as
   fundamental ingredients for establishing resilient, polycentric forms of
   environmental governance. This is nowhere more pertinent than in the
   case of the complex adaptive systems associated with urban areas.
   Decentralisation of urban green space management has been posited as an
   element thereof which, according to resilience thinking, should
   contribute to the adaptive capacity of cities and the ecosystem services
   upon which they rely. Implicit in this move towards increased adaptive
   capacity is the ability to manage through innovation. Although the
   importance of innovation towards system adaptability has been
   acknowledged, little work has thus far been carried out which
   demonstrates that innovative use of urban green space represents a form
   of adaptive response to environmental conditions. The current paper
   reports on research which maps examples of organised social-ecological
   innovation (OSEI) in an urban study area and evaluates them as adaptive
   responses to local environmental conditions which may contribute to
   system resilience. The results present OSEI as a coherent body of
   responses to local social and environmental deprivation, exhibiting
   diversity and adaptability according to individual contexts. The study
   therefore provides evidence for the importance of local stakeholder-led
   innovation as in the building of adaptive capacity in urban
   social-ecological systems.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE COMMONS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {12},

Pages = {485-518},
Abstract = {This study develops and applies an interdisciplinary and mixed method
   approach to operationalize the social-ecological systems (SES) framework
   in the context of aquaculture, the fastest growing food production
   sector worldwide. We apply this methodology to conduct a case study of
   community-based pond aquaculture on the island of Lombok, West Nusa
   Tenggara, Indonesia. This diagnostic approach demonstrates how
   sustainability challenges are interrelated at multiple levels through an
   analysis applying common-pool resource (CPR) and collective action
   theories. At the community level, qualitative data show how pond
   aquaculture systems can have CPR dilemmas, requiring communities to work
   together to solve them. We show how a provision dilemma manifests from
   the need to maintain common canal infrastructure to distribute water to
   private ponds. Asymmetric incentives to contribute exist because there
   are up and downstream users in the pond network, similar to some
   irrigation systems. Second, at the level of individual ponds, we
   developed indicators for the Resource System, Resource Unit, Governance
   and Actor tiers of the SES framework. Indicator data for each pond was
   measured and transformed into normalized quantitative scores to examine
   the relationships between social and ecological outcomes within and
   between ponds. We combine the results of our multi-level analysis to
   discuss the broader social-ecological relationships which link
   collective action challenges in managing common canal infrastructure
   with pond level outcomes and current government policies for advancing
   community development. We emphasize the need for increased knowledge and
   training on effective aquaculture practice as an underlying driver of
   current system conditions. This study raises many methodological
   challenges associated with designing empirically based SES research and
   building SES theory. We discuss challenges with integrating diverse data
   types, indicator selection and making normative assumptions about
   sustainability.},

Abstract = {PurposeUnder Malaysian Law, the maintenance and management of common
   property have traditionally been viewed as insoluble challenges in the
   self-organisational efforts for high-rise low-cost housing developments.
   As the population increases, more shared resources become heavily
   exploited with few willing to contribute towards the sustainability of
   resources. Many researchers argued a better way would be to convert
   these shared resources into a private or state-managed entity. Hence,
   with that assumption, this paper aims to examine how better physical
   characteristics can result in greater collective action.
   Design/methodology/approachThis research paper adopted a quantitative
   method approach to determine how the standard of physical
   characteristics influenced the quality of collective action in high-rise
   low-cost housing. The method included a questionnaire survey of 519
   parcel holders chosen via stratified purposeful random sampling from
   four high-rise low-cost housing areas. FindingsThe paper found a
   positive correlation between the quality of physical characteristics and
   the collective action gained. The findings highlighted that the standard
   of workmanship of high-rise low-cost units (including the common
   properties), the crime rate in the neighbourhood and the condition of
   lift systems - when improved - were significant positive predictors of
   collective action. Practical implicationsHousing developers should pay
   attention to the quality of both low-cost units and related common
   properties, as this endeavour will assist greatly in future collective
   action management. Originality/valueThe study was justified in terms of
   its originality as few research studies adopted the social-ecological
   system framework that focused on the correlation between the quality of
   physical characteristics and the collective action of parcel holders.},

Abstract = {In semi-arid sub-Saharan Africa, farming populations face harsh climatic
   conditions but also very unequal and dynamic social processes that
   affect their resilience. This study addresses aspects of power and
   social justice related to the social-ecological system of the Niayes
   coastal region of Senegal and examines the potential of agroecology to
   improve the adaptive capacity of smallholder farmers. We performed a
   knowledge co-production process with a local farmer union to identify
   the main social-ecological nexuses that matter for smallholder farmers,
   their dynamics and the influence of powerful actors and institutions on
   them. We also look at the potential actions of the farmer union under
   the banner of agroecology to transform these dynamics. We found that
   social-ecological dynamics involve reinforcing feedback loops that
   undermine the resilience of smallholder farmers and that powerful actors
   such as agribusinesses have a strong influence on these processes. Union
   actions promoting agroecology have enhanced system thinking and related
   solutions, but observed social justice claims are very recent and have a
   limited scope. Our findings expand the notion of resilience grabbing,
   understood as the undermining of resilience through the loss of commons,
   to include systemic degradations due to direct and indirect actions of
   involved stakeholders. We also propose to expand the notion of
   resilience justice vertically, integrating procedural and recognition
   justice, and horizontally, integrating linked social-ecological issues.
   We conclude that agroecology can become a transformative bridge from
   resilience grabbing to resilience justice, but must be more sensitive to
   power relations, in particular around labour.},

Title = {From religion to conservation: unfolding 300 years of collective action
   in a Greek sacred forest},
Journal = {FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {131},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Sacred Natural Sites are integrated-coupled systems with mutual social
   and natural interactions, and they exist within a variety of local
   cultures and regions of the world. In Europe and especially in the
   Mediterranean basin, changing land use patterns and population decline
   since World War II have had a dramatic impact on the socioecological
   structure and management practices of many of such sites. At the same
   time, old beliefs and taboos are often neglected due to modernization,
   rural depopulation, and change in community's structure, norms, and
   codes. Understanding how social, ecological, and policy processes
   changed through time becomes thus relevant to identify the main criteria
   for effective collective action and sustainability of the studied
   systems. In this paper, we applied Ostrom's social-ecological systems
   framework to model the main socio-ecological processes acting upon a
   sacred forest in Epirus (Greece) over a 300 years' period. The
   multidisciplinary approach included collection of archival and
   ecological data and ethnographic research (semi-structured interviews).
   Results indicate that significant changes have occurred in social,
   economic, political, and institutional terms since the creation of the
   settlement (17th century). However, the sacred grove has been of major
   importance to the adjacent local community that acts as its custodian
   guardian even nowadays. Collective action for the preservation of the
   forest has been achieved under various governance regimes that
   transformed through time traditional religious taboos into modern
   conservation approaches. This analysis revealed that local traditional
   management practices of commons can serve as successful socio-ecological
   conservation examples.},

Title = {Nurturing ecosystem-based adaptations in South Africa's Garden Route: a

Journal = {REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {19},
Number = {7, SI},

Abstract = {Increasing human demands for ecosystem services due to climate change,
   population growth, poverty, lack of employment, tourism, and concomitant
   coastal property development threatens adaptive capacity in South
   Africa's coastlines. Adaptation strategies frequently propose
   ecosystem-based adaptation (EBA) as a model for transformative change.
   However, several studies point to difficulties implementing EBA across
   the world. The aim of this paper is to assess to what extent
   social-ecological systems approaches and common pool resource (CPR)
   governance theories could inform EBA. Data obtained from interviews and
   surveys with policy makers and residents in South Africa's Garden Route
   District were interpreted using the robustness framework (RF) and the
   design principles (DPs), two common tools for analyzing CPR governance.
   We found that the Garden Route coast is threatened by negative
   interactions between hard public and private infrastructures and
   ecological infrastructures (the cornerstone of EBA) which are driven by
   weak local government bodies and asymmetrical power relations. By coding
   the data for elements/interactions within the RF and then identifying
   and mapping the DPs onto the RF, we also revealed ways to leverage
   transformative EBA in the Garden Route. Our analyses suggest that the
   interactions between human-made and ecological infrastructures, as well
   as power relation, should be at the core of any development debate.
   Trade-offs should aim for maximum congruence between sustainability and
   equity in ecosystem services provisioning. This paper provides some
   considerations for researchers and decision makers to leverage
   transformative EBA that could potentially apply to areas experiencing
   similar challenges.},

Abstract = {This study examines how agricultural frontier expansion and grazing
   practices develop in the paramos under communal tenure in the northern
   Ecuadorian Andes and how rules to control them emerge within communal
   governance. We approach these questions through the lens of collective
   action and cultural resilience, to understand the evolution of communal
   governance. We analyze a case study of the Comitd de Paramo Nukanchik
   Urku, a multicommunal organization created in the 1990s for collective
   resource management. We use the analytical framework of
   social-ecological systems (SES) to approach changes of the agricultural
   frontiers and grazing activities as conservation outcomes resulting from
   changes in resource units, actors, and governance structures. Through a
   mixed-method approach combining air photo analysis (years 1956, 1993,
   and 2008) and qualitative research, we examine spatial patterns of
   settlement and agricultural frontier expansion, historical grazing
   practices, and the main elements of current collective paramo managemenL
   Our results indicate that: (1) the demarcation of an agreed agricultural
   frontier as a territorial landmark is a response aiming to control the
   increase of crops and dwellings at higher elevations, and to limit
   grazing activities; (2) the authority's legitimation of the Committee
   and its Board is crucial to develop rules and to enforce them; and (3)
   legitimation is achieved through conservation knowledge and autonomous
   decisions to control paramos considered a communal territory. A broader
   comprehension of the context and history of cultural change is needed to
   understand the emergence of communal governance of paramos.
   Cultural-political dimensions are key to the cultural resilience of
   social systems in SES and to strengthening rules and institutional
   diversity to manage the commons in Andean communities.},

Title = {Beyond noise mitigation: managing soundscapes as common-pool resources},

Abstract = {The extent of noise and its impacts continues to grow globally
   indicating a different approach from regulating individual noise sources
   is needed. We pose the argument that soundscapes, or the acoustic
   environment, should be managed as a common-pool resource (CPR). Using
   CPR theory, we argue that soundscapes possess key features of CPRs: (1)
   multiple soundscape users, (2) difficulty of exclusion, and (3)
   subtractability and degradation. Using Ostrom's Social-Ecological
   Systems (SES) framework, we describe the main elements of soundscapes to
   consider for their sustainable management. In order to assess noise
   issues and challenges in managing national park soundscapes, we
   conducted interviews with U.S. National Park Service managers at parks
   identified as having air tour overflight impacts. While most managers
   indicated that aircraft overflights posed the most serious impacts to
   park resources and visitor experiences, the park units also experienced
   several other types of noise impacts including traffic on park roads,
   park maintenance operations, and different types of motorized
   recreational vehicles. Addressing single sources of noise is necessary,
   as is the case with air tour overflights, but we argue that a more
   comprehensive approach is needed to protect park soundscapes. From this
   study several SES framework variables emerged that need to be addressed
   for sustainable management, such as the lack of clear soundscape
   boundaries, availability of acoustic monitoring and data, and the number
   and types of soundscape users. Based on CPR theory and using the SES
   framework, the challenges and a potential new approach for sustainable
   management are discussed.},

Abstract = {In the context of governance of human-environment interactions, a
   panacea refers to a blueprint for a single type of governance system
   (e.g., government ownership, privatization, community property) that is
   applied to all environmental problems. The aim of this special feature
   is to provide theoretical analysis and empirical evidence to caution
   against the tendency, when confronted with pervasive uncertainty, to
   believe that scholars can generate simple models of linked
   social-ecological systems and deduce general solutions to the overuse of
   resources. Practitioners and scholars who fall into panacea traps
   falsely assume that all problems of resource governance can be
   represented by a small set of simple models, because they falsely
   perceive that the preferences and perceptions of most resource users are
   the same. Readers of this special feature will become acquainted with
   many cases in which panaceas fail. The articles provide an excellent
   overview of why they fail. Furthermore, the articles in this special
   feature address how scholars and public officials can increase the
   prospects for future sustainable resource use by facilitating a
   diagnostic approach in selecting appropriate starting points for
   governance and monitoring, as well as by learning from the outcomes of
   new policies and adapting in light of effective feedback.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE COMMONS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {8},
Number = {2},
Pages = {277-303},
Abstract = {The need to understand how to sustainably govern oceanic fisheries has
   become increasingly urgent as their contribution to global food security
   and livelihoods are threatened by declining stocks. Atlantic Bluefin
   Tuna (ABFT) is a prominent example of the complexities associated with
   widely distributed oceanic resources, extending in this case to include
   much of the North-Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea. This distribution has
   led to limited attention from commons theorists that tend to focus on
   small-scale social ecological systems. Therefore in order to explore the
   fit between theories of the commons developed in small-scale systems, we
   apply the Social-Ecological Systems Meta-Analysis Database (SESMAD) to
   systematically analyze ABFT governance over a 22 year period. The
   results, which focus on the effects of resource characteristics, broadly
   correspond to the expectations of commons theory. Interestingly,
   however, the addition of resource storage in the form of ABFT ranches
   appears to be contributing to unsustainable harvests. This stands in
   contrast to previous findings in the commons literature that storage
   tends to enhance prospects for sustainable governance. Therefore several
   alternative hypotheses are developed by comparing and contrasting
   attributes of ABFT and canal irrigation storage. These hypotheses may be
   used in future research to evaluate the conditions in which storage
   enhances prospects for sustainable governance.},

Title = {Re-examining balinese subaks through the lens of cultural multilevel

Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Pages = {35-47},

Abstract = {Overcoming environmental challenges requires understanding when and why
   individuals adopt cooperative behaviors, how individual behaviors and
   interactions among resource users change over time, and how group
   structure and group dynamics impact behaviors, institutions, and
   resource conditions. Cultural multilevel selection (CMLS) is a
   theoretical framework derived from theories of cultural evolution and
   cultural group selection that emphasizes pressures affecting different
   levels of social organization as well as conflicts among these levels.
   As such, CMLS can be useful for understanding many environmental
   challenges. With this paper, we use evidence from the literature and
   hypothetical scenarios to show how the framework can be used to
   understand the emergence and persistence of sustainable
   social-ecological systems. We apply the framework to the Balinese system
   of rice production and focus on two important cultural traits
   (synchronized cropping and the institutions and rituals associated with
   water management). We use data from the literature that discusses
   bottom-up (self-organized, complex adaptive system) and top-down
   explanations for the system and discuss how (1) the emergence of group
   structure, (2) group-level variation in cropping strategies,
   institutions, and rituals, and (3) variation in overall yields as a
   result of different strategies and institutions, could have allowed for
   the spread of group-beneficial traits and the increasing complexity of
   the system. We also outline cultural transmission mechanisms that can
   explain the spread of group-beneficial traits in Bali and describe the
   kinds of data that would be required to validate the framework in
   forward-looking studies.},

Title = {Appraisal of social-ecological innovation as an adaptive response by
   stakeholders to local conditions: Mapping stakeholder involvement in
   horticulture orientated green space management},
Journal = {URBAN FORESTRY \& URBAN GREENING},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {18},

Month = {AUG 1},
Abstract = {Urban areas are hubs of creativity and innovation providing fertile
   ground for novel responses to modern environmental challenges. Previous
   studies have attempted to conceptualise the ecological, social and
   political potential of social-ecological innovation in urban green space
   management. However, little work has been conducted on the
   social-ecological conditions influencing their occurrence and
   distribution. Further research is therefore necessary to demonstrate
   whether stakeholder stewardship of green resources contributes towards
   adaptive capacity in social-ecological systems. The research reported
   here explored the extent of organised social-ecological innovations in a
   continuous urban landscape comprising three adjoining metropolitan
   areas: Manchester, Salford and Trafford (UK). Examples of horticulture
   orientated organised social-ecological innovation were identified using
   a snowball-sampling method. Their distribution, explored with GIS and
   remote sensing technology, was found to be significantly associated with
   levels of both, social and ecological, deprivation. The study presented
   social-ecological innovation as an adaptive response to environmental
   stressors, conditioned by specific social and ecological parameters in
   the landscape. It therefore provides empirical support for
   social-ecological innovation as a valid ingredient contributing to
   resilience in adaptive social-ecological systems. Not only do such
   collective community-led elements of natural resource management warrant
   acknowledgement in urban green space planning, but their distribution
   and productivity may provide a valuable social-ecological laboratory for
   the study of polycentric governance and adaptive capacity in the urban
   environment. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Do responsible fishing areas work? Comparing collective action
   challenges in three small-scale fisheries in Costa Rica},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE COMMONS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {705-746},
Abstract = {Costa Rica is supporting Marine Areas of Responsible Fishing (AMPRs) to
   enable small-scale fishing communities to apply for exclusive harvesting
   and management rights within spatially delimited areas under a
   co-management policy framework. Communities need to self-organize their
   own fishing association and develop a fishing management plan (POP) to
   apply. Seven AMPRs have been established in the Gulf of Nicoya,
   highlighting Costa Rica's efforts to follow the FAO Small-Scale
   Fisheries Guidelines, but all face collective action challenges to
   develop and achieve common goals and implementation. In this article, we
   conduct a qualitative comparative analysis by applying the
   Social-Ecological System Framework (SESF) as a tool to identify the
   social and ecological conditions influencing collective action and
   co-management in three AMPRs in the Gulf of Nicoya, and we compare the
   similarities and differences between them. Our findings show that all
   three AMPRs face collective action challenges for different reasons.
   Nonetheless, some commonalities exist. Common drivers have motivated
   collective action in the creation of the AMPRs, including the desire to
   restrict certain types of fishing gears due to perceptions of resource
   scarcity and high dependence on local resources. Variables such as
   monitoring and sanctioning mechanisms, strong leadership and the
   economic heterogeneity of actors positively influence collective action
   in management. However, there are also variables hindering collective
   action, such as mistrust among actors, internal conflicts, lack of
   governmental support and resource unit mobility. Our findings suggest
   that AMPRs are a promising and potentially effective governance strategy
   because they can empower marginalized small-scale fishing communities
   and bring them into national development processes. However, there is an
   evident need for more state and local community investment into capacity
   building for self-organization and deliberation processes that can
   better enable AMPRs to move beyond ``paper parks{''}, and towards being
   a practically useful governance strategy to showcase Costa Rica's
   commitment to FAO Small-Scale Fisheries Guidelines. Adapting the AMPR
   model to fit the social-ecological context of each community is critical
   for success, despite the perceived similarity between the AMPRs.},

Abstract = {Socio-ecological systems (SESs), the spate irrigation system in our
   case, operate under the environment of stress from several external and
   contextual factors. The literature on collective action in Common Pool
   Resources (CPRs) considers non-storage and non-stationary
   characteristics of a resource as major obstacle to its sustainability.
   However, the case study systems have endured, despite acute scarcity and
   uncertainty of irrigation, for centuries in arid and semi-arid
   environments of the Middle East, Africa, South Asia, parts of South
   America and Central Asia, where rainfall is too low to support rainfed
   farming. These rainfall dependent irrigation systems are more complex
   and can exhibit unexpected changes as a result of climatic disturbances.
   Thus, actions directed at enhancing robustness to a particular set of
   disturbances can trigger changes in ecological dynamics that may, in
   turn, alter the set of disturbances faced by communities. The four case
   study systems for this research were selected from the Punjab (Pakistan)
   by purposive sampling, comprising two perennial and non-perennial farmer
   managed spate irrigation systems (FMIS) and two perennial and
   non-perennial agency managed irrigation systems (AMIS), providing 2X2
   typology for analysis. The sustainability framework by Anderies et al.
   (A framework to analyse the robustness of social-ecological systems from
   an institutional perspective. Ecology and Society, 2004) has been used
   for analysis of this study.},

Title = {Understanding and Managing Freshwater Recreational Fisheries as Complex

Pages = {1-41},
Abstract = {The state of knowledge on the science and management of freshwater
   recreational fisheries is reviewed, with the objective of integrating
   insights from disparate fields such as fisheries science, environmental
   complexity theory, common-pool-resource theory, and resilience theory.
   First, freshwater recreational fisheries are characterized as complex
   adaptive social-ecological systems (SESs). Subsequently, two
   interrelated frameworks, drawing on the Ostrom framework for the
   analysis of SESs and adaptive management as key foundations, are
   presented. These frameworks are useful to structure the complexity and
   apprehend the various feedbacks and links inherent in any particular
   recreational fisheries system. Moreover, the frameworks help to identify
   operational management strategies in the face of substantial
   social-ecological uncertainty. It is concluded that to understand and
   manage freshwater recreational fisheries as complex adaptive SESs, a
   sustained shift from disciplinary to inter- and sometimes
   transdisciplinary research as well as a focus on flexible, adaptive and
   generally enabling rather than command-and-control type governance and
   management are needed. Understanding and managing recreational fisheries
   as complex adaptive SESs will benefit from an increasing focus on (i)
   managing social-ecological feedbacks and processes, (ii) managing
   critical slow variables that either drive the system or maintain it in
   potentially undesirable states, and (iii) managing and maintaining
   social and ecological diversity. It is hoped that the frameworks
   presented in this article may guide future interdisciplinary inquiry to
   manage for sustainability by building resilience.},

Title = {Comparisons of historical Dutch commons inform about the long-term

Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {16},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG 27},
Abstract = {Human societies and natural ecosystems are under threat by growing
   populations, overexploitation of natural resources and climate change.
   This calls for more sustainable utilization of resources based on past
   experiences and insights from many different disciplines.
   Interdisciplinary approaches to studies of historical commons have
   potential to identify drivers of change and keys to success in the past,
   and offer advice about the management and use of shared resources in
   contemporary and future systems. We address these issues by applying an
   ecological perspective to historical data on social-ecological systems.
   We perform comparisons and time series analyses for nine successful
   Dutch commons for which high-resolution data on the regulatory
   activities and use of shared resources is available for on average 380
   years (range 236 to 568) during the period 1300 to 1972. Within commons,
   institutional developments were oscillating, with periods of intense
   regulatory activity being separated by periods of low activity, and with
   the dynamics of regulations being largely independent across commons.
   Ecological theory posits that species that occupy similar niches should
   show correlated responses to environmental challenges; however, commons
   using more similar resources did not have more parallel or similar
   institutional developments. One notable exception was that sanctioning
   was more frequent in commons that directed more regulatory activities
   towards non-renewable subsoil resources, whereas there was no
   association between sanctioning and the use of renewable resources. This
   might indicate that commoners were aware of potential resource depletion
   and attempted to influence freeriding by actively trying to solve the
   underlying social dilemmas. Sanctioning regulations were more frequent
   during the first than during the second part of a common's life,
   indicating that while sanctioning might have been important for the
   establishment of commons it was not key to the long-term persistence of
   historical commons.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},

Volume = {237},
Pages = {187-199},
Month = {MAY 1},
Abstract = {This paper investigates the dynamics of institutional development and
   co-management performance in smallscale fisheries. The study covers
   different contexts and spatial and temporal scales, for nine case
   studies in the South Pacific. In these cases, new co-management
   institutions were intentionally set up from 2008 to 2016 through fishery
   policy intervention to address over-exploitation problems of sea
   cucumber resources. This was carried out in a process of adaptive
   experimentation, based on a collaborative and problem-solving approach
   to governance, and a context-based vision of sustainability issues. In
   order to quantitatively and empirically assess change in governance
   within and between cases, a multidimensional analytical framework of
   governance performance is developed. A set of governance performance
   criteria is defined and the criteria are scored using data from an
   institutional diagnosis of the cases, throughout the research period.
   Ten out of eleven criteria were positively impacted by the co-management
   interventions. Three institutional development trajectories can be
   identified for the fishery co-management building process, involving a
   range of gradual and abrupt changes. Consolidation of the institutional
   changes achieved by the interventions is required to successfully
   develop the resilience of the fishing systems to multiple stresses. This
   empirical study provides a methodology for systematically assessing
   institutional dynamics in fisheries, and in particular the crafting and
   sustaining of co-management regimes in small-scale fisheries. The
   approach could potentially be applied to other complex social ecological
   systems.},

Title = {A Politicized, Legal Pluralist Analysis of the Commons' Resilience: The
   Case of the Regole d'Ampezzo},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {18},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {How does law affect the resilience of common-pool resources? To answer
   this question this paper adopts an institutionalist perspective on law,
   arguing that this shares many similarities with the approach of some
   legal pluralist scholars, i.e., the recognition that a social-ecological
   system is influenced by a plurality of legal orders having-to borrow
   Santos terminology-porous qualities. Studying the production and types
   of relationships between these legal orders can help us in determining
   whether a system is or is not likely to be resilient. More precisely, if
   the legal orders interact in a harmonious and dynamic way thanks to
   bottom-up as well as top-down forces, the system is likely to be
   resilient. This theoretical hypothesis is tested in a case study, i.e.,
   an alpine common property in northern Italy called Regole d'Ampezzo. It
   becomes clear that its resilience to various shocks is due to the
   harmonic integration and adjustments of customary, property, and
   environmental laws. However, the completeness of this type of analysis
   is put under discussion when we move from the macro-institutional level
   to the micro-political one, i.e., to an analysis of intra-community
   power relations. Drawing on the work of Foucault on the power-subject
   nexus, the paper attempts to show that in the specific context of the
   Regole, the harmonic legal pluralist orders operate as a technique of
   government, perpetuating certain relationships of power between the
   actors of the common pool resource. At the same time, the relationships
   of power also contain the possibility of their reversal since, following
   Foucault, exercising power means acting on the actions of free subjects.
   The general conclusion is that a legal study of the resilience of common
   pool resources can benefit from a politicized version of legal
   pluralism.},

Title = {Archetypes of common village pasture problems in the South Caucasus:
   insights from comparative case studies in Georgia and Azerbaijan},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2019},

Abstract = {Complex social-ecological systems (SES), especially systems with common
   pool resources, often exhibit system dynamics characterized by
   emergence, where system properties cannot be fully explained by input
   variables. This causes challenges when it comes to explaining resource
   use problems because problem dynamics can differ from case to case
   despite similar input variables. Archetype analysis with its focus on
   identifying building blocks of nature-society relations might provide a
   means to tackle emergence and complexity in the analysis of resource use
   problems in SES. Using data from inter- and transdisciplinary research
   investigating comparative case studies on common village pasture
   management in the Caucasus region, we use the archetype approach with a
   focus on system archetypes that place particular emphasis on recognizing
   recurrent structures and internal dynamics. We apply three system
   archetypes, the Tragedy of the Commons, Shifting the Burden, and Success
   to the Successful, to different aspects of interlinked management
   problems that occur repeatedly in the case study data. Using SES
   variables characterizing the cases, we discuss variable combinations
   that may trigger specific dynamics. Moreover, we explore interlinkages
   between archetypical problems and discuss possible solutions based on
   self-governance. We find that the archetype approach with a focus on
   system archetypes resulted in consistent explanations of problem
   dynamics leading to important additional insights into root causes and
   internal archetypical dynamics compared with existing knowledge.
   Regarding problem solutions and policy recommendations, we show that
   viewing archetypical problems as interlinked in their actual case-study
   context leads to different recommendations than when each archetype is
   viewed on its own.},

Title = {Reconsidering the role of the built environment in human-wildlife
   interactions},
Journal = {PEOPLE AND NATURE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {3},
Number = {1},
Pages = {104-114},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {1. In facing our greatest challenges, researchers have questioned where
   the `wild things' will reside in the future, and large carnivores have
   been a primary focal area.
   2. The built environment plays a critical role in the propagation of
   countless species including carnivores; however, contemporary
   conceptualizations of human-nature relations do not satisfactorily
   attend to where the built environment should be placed within existing
   human-nature relation frameworks or how it impacts our ability to find
   space for carnivores.
   3. This paper fills this information gap by investigating the role of
   the built environment in social-ecological systems (SES), specifically
   wildlife and carnivore conservation.
   4. The paper unfolds in four stages: The first reviews empirical efforts
   to capture the relationship between human-natural-wildlife systems and
   the built environment. Second, using insights from the built environment
   literature, I argue that moving away from a common pool resource focus,
   decoupling wildlife and natural systems, investigating all
   infrastructure types and their interactions across systems, and
   considering the notion of hybrid systems offer pathways forward. Third,
   an explanation of the built environment's linkages to human and
   carnivore systems is undertaken to illustrate how the built environment
   facilitates the material and symbolic interactions through a blending of
   properties from human, wildlife and natural systems. Lastly, the
   argument is made that attending to the role of the built environment in
   human-wildlife relations can stimulate new research that reveals
   unhelpful habitual behaviour, feedbacks and barriers, and may also help
   explain unintended or unexplained consequences impacting human-carnivore
   relations not fully considered under existing frameworks.},

Abstract = {How to create and adjust governing institutions so that they align (fit)
   with complex ecosystem processes and structures across scales is an
   issue of increasing concern in conservation. It is argued that lack of
   such social-ecological fit makes governance and conservation difficult,
   yet progress in explicitly defining and rigorously testing what
   constitutes a good fit has been limited. We used a novel modeling
   approach and data from case studies of fishery and forest conservation
   to empirically test presumed relationships between conservation outcomes
   and certain patterns of alignment of social-ecological interdependences.
   Our approach made it possible to analyze conservation outcome on a
   systems level while also providing information on how individual actors
   are positioned in the complex web of social-ecological
   interdependencies. We found that when actors who shared resources were
   also socially linked, conservation at the level of the whole
   social-ecological system was positively affected. When the scales at
   which individual actors used resources and the scale at which ecological
   resources were interconnected to other ecological resources were aligned
   through tightened feedback loops, conservation outcome was better than
   when they were not aligned. The analysis of individual actors' positions
   in the web of social-ecological interdependencies was helpful in
   understanding why a system has a certain level of social-ecological fit.
   Results of analysis of positions showed that different actors
   contributed in very different ways to achieve a certain fit and revealed
   some underlying difference between the actors, for example in terms of
   actors' varying rights to access and use different ecological resources.},

Title = {Weak feedbacks, governance mismatches, and the robustness of
   social-ecological systems: an analysis of the Southwest Nova Scotia
   lobster fishery with comparison to Maine},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {19},
Number = {4},
Abstract = {The insights in Governing the Commons have provided foundational ideas
   for commons research in the past 23 years. However, the cases that
   Elinor Ostrom analyzed have been exposed to new social, economic, and
   ecological disturbances. What has happened to these cases since the
   1980s? We reevaluated one of Ostrom's case studies, the lobster and
   groundfishery of Port Lameron, Southwest Nova Scotia (SWNS). Ostrom
   suggested that the self-governance of this fishery was fragile because
   the government did not recognize the rights of resource users to
   organize their own rules. In the Maine lobster fishery, however, the
   government formalized customary rules and decentralized power to fishing
   ports. We applied the concepts of feedback, governance mismatches, and
   the robustness of social-ecological systems to understand the pathway of
   institutional change in Port Lameron. We revisited the case of Port
   Lameron using marine harvesters' accounts collected from participant
   observation, informal interviews and surveys, and literature on
   fisheries policy and ecology in SWNS and Maine. We found that the
   government's failure to recognize the customary rights of harvesters to
   organize has weakened feedback between the operational level, where
   resource users interact with the resource, and the collective-choice
   level, where agents develop rules to influence the behavior of resource
   users. This has precipitated governance mismatches, which have led
   harvesters to believe that the decision-making process is detrimental to
   their livelihoods. Thus, harvesters rarely participate in decision
   making and resist regulatory change. In Maine, harvesters can influence
   decisions through participation, but there is a trade-off. With higher
   influence in decisions, captains have co-opted the decision-making
   process. Nevertheless, we suggest that the fisheries of SWNS are more
   vulnerable to social-ecological change because of weaker feedbacks than
   in Maine. Finally, we have discussed the potential benefits of
   polycentricity to both fisheries.},

Journal = {POLICY SCIENCES},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {44},
Number = {1},
Pages = {35-52},

Abstract = {This paper addresses the role of voluntary environmental initiatives by
   the tourism industry to alleviate social dilemmas for the management of
   natural resources. The objective is to explore whether previous findings
   on the determinants of voluntary action in the management of common-pool
   resources (CPR) also apply to a sector, such as tourism, where
   non-extractive uses are dominant. The paper applies the
   social-ecological systems framework recently developed by Ostrom
   (Science, 325, 419-422, 2009) to analyze qualitative data from
   meta-analyses of successful voluntary environmental initiatives in
   tourism. Results show that the determinants of voluntary action in
   tourism are partially consistent with previous research on CPR, finding
   relevant the presence of leadership, norms of behavior among members of
   the voluntary initiatives, shared mental modes, salience of the resource
   for users, and substantial productivity of the resource system in the
   likelihood of self-organization. However, other variables that have been
   shown to be relevant in non-tourism CPR situations are not supported by
   this analysis, such as: most variables regarding the ecological system
   (its size, predictability, and the mobility of its derived resource
   units) as well as the number of users and supportive collective choice
   rules that enable users to craft and enforce some of their own rules.
   The implications of this partial mismatch in findings are not
   straightforward. The paper presents a set of research questions that
   open a path for further research.},

Abstract = {Current theoretical models of the commons assert that common-pool
   resources can only be managed sustainably with clearly defined
   boundaries around both communities and the resources that they use. In
   these theoretical models, open access inevitably leads to a tragedy of
   the commons. However, in many open access systems, use of common-pool
   resources seems to be sustainable over the long term (i.e., current
   resource use does not threaten use of common-pool resources for future
   generations). Here, we outline the conditions that support sustainable
   resource use in open property regimes. We use the conceptual framework
   of complex adaptive systems to explain how processes within and
   couplings between human and natural systems can lead to the emergence of
   efficient, equitable, and sustainable resource use. We illustrate these
   dynamics in eight case studies of different social-ecological systems,
   including mobile pastoralism, marine and freshwater fisheries, swidden
   agriculture, and desert foraging. Our theoretical framework identifies
   eight conditions that are critical for the emergence of sustainable use
   of common-pool resources in open property regimes. In addition, we
   explain how changes in boundary conditions may push open property
   regimes to either common property regimes or a tragedy of the commons.
   Our theoretical model of emergent sustainability helps us to understand
   the diversity and dynamics of property regimes across a wide range of
   social-ecological systems and explains the enigma of open access without
   a tragedy. We recommend that policy interventions in such
   self-organizing systems should focus on managing the conditions that are
   critical for the emergence and persistence of sustainability.},

Title = {Governing the yarshagumba gold rush': a comparative study of governance
   systems in the Kailash Landscape in India and Nepal},

Abstract = {Under present conditions of economic globalization, social-ecological
   systems undergo rapid changes. In this context, internal and external
   forces put heavy pressure on the governance systems of commons to adapt
   effectively. While institutional learning has been identified as a key
   element for the adaptive governance of social-ecological systems, there
   is still limited knowledge of what roles communities and governmental
   actors play in these processes. In this study, we take the case of
   yarshagumba (English: caterpillar fungus), a formerly non-valued product
   in the Himalayas, which has recently been transformed into a highly
   valuable resource within a short time. We compare the governance systems
   in collection sites in the Kailash Landscape in India and Nepalby using
   an analytical framework developed by Pahl-Wostl. Our findings show that
   in these remote mountain areas, communities and community-led
   organizations are highly flexible in responding to immediate resource
   value changes by establishing communal management arrangements. At the
   same time, however, communities have difficulties to enforce their newly
   developed informal and formal arrangements. During the process of
   learning the link between the amendment of arrangements on
   community-level and the revision of formal policies and frames at the
   state or national level is only partly established. Against this
   background, we argue that in the context of rapid change, adaptive
   governance requires the concerted interaction of actors at the local and
   the national levels in order to enable the sustainable use of common
   pool natural resources.},

   social-ecological systems to guide the construction of a model of this
   transition. An increase in the resource price leads the owner to prefer
   communal harvesting, which simplifies monitoring against theft. I

   governance, (2) deploy more sophisticated analytical methods to make
   sense of different outcomes and patterns of relationships among
   outcomes, and (3) create better, globally representative, hierarchically
   organized datasets on the commons. Efforts to build better theories and
   develop a more rigorous understanding of outcomes are also necessary to
   keep in view the needs of poor, marginal populations that depend on the

Abstract = {Governing common pool resources (CPR) in the face of disturbances such
   as globalization and climate change is challenging. The outcome of any
   CPR governance regime is the influenced by local combinations of social,
   institutional, and biophysical factors, as well as cross-scale
   interdependencies. In this study, we take a step towards understanding
   multiple-causation of CPR outcomes by analyzing (1) the co-occurrence of
   design principles (DPs) by activity (irrigation, fishery and forestry),
   and (2) the combination(s) of DPs leading to social and ecological
   success. We analyzed 69 cases pertaining to three different activities:
   irrigation, fishery, and forestry. We find that the importance of the
   design principles is dependent upon the natural and hard human made
   infrastructure (i.e. canals, equipment, vessels etc.). For example,
   clearly defined social boundaries are important when the natural
   infrastructure is highly mobile (i.e. tuna fish), while monitoring is
   more important when the natural infrastructure is more static (i.e.
   forests or water contained within an irrigation system). However, we
   also find that congruence between local conditions and rules and
   proportionality between investment and extraction are key for CPR
   success independent from the natural and human hard made infrastructure.
   We further provide new visualization techniques for co-occurrence
   patterns and add to qualitative comparative analysis by introducing a
   reliability metric to deal with a large meta-analysis dataset on
   secondary data where information is missing or uncertain.},

Title = {Beyond regulations in fisheries management:: The dilemmas of the ``beach
   recorders{''} <i>Bwana dikos</i> in Zanzibar, Tanzania},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {11},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Institutions and organizations are considered key elements for the
   successful management of natural resources. However, much of the work in
   this field has focused mainly on regulations. This paper identifies
   other factors, i.e., normative, cultural-cognitive, and psychological,
   affecting institutional performance, management, and feedback. Using the
   case of Zanzibar, Tanzania, it is illustrated through the analysis of
   the Bwana Dikos, which are public officials placed in villages and
   landing sites for monitoring purposes, how a well-designed organization
   and clear regulations might be necessary, but not sufficient, to achieve
   successful management. Through triangulation of interviews, document
   reviews, and participant observation, it was found that four dilemmas,
   i.e., kinship, loyalty, poverty, and control, interfered with
   institutional performance, thereby decreasing efficiency. Poverty was
   the main driving factor explaining the Bwana Diko's performance, but
   loyalty elements crosscut the other dilemmas as well. Psychological
   aspects were important and deserve further research. The control dilemma
   refers to the institutional mismatches in spatial and cognitive terms.
   Lack of institutional replication at the proper spatial scales
   negatively affected the resilience of the whole institutional setting.
   Furthermore, the importance of embeddedness, coproduction, and windows
   of opportunities to improve the institutional setting and the poverty
   condition of the Bwana Diko is discussed. This paper shows that a broad
   view of institutions is urgently needed to understand the complexity of
   social-ecological systems, achieve sustainability goals, tackle
   development, and meet our fundamental challenge, poverty alleviation.},

Title = {Individual and collective political efficacy predict farmer engagement
   and support for groundwater policies: implications from the California
   Sustainable Groundwater Management Act},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {29},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {Common-pool resource theory suggests that the direct participation of
   local natural resource users in the management of common-pool resources
   can lead to effective management regimes. Nevertheless, the drivers of
   participation in common-pool resource management, including policy
   decision processes, and the effects of participation on stakeholder
   attitudes and policy preferences are relatively understudied. Here, we
   combine the social-ecological system (SES) framework with the political
   science concept of political efficacy to examine both contextual and
   personal drivers of farmer participation in California, USA's 2014
   Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA), as well as the effect of
   participation on support for policy mechanisms from the SGMA. We
   surveyed a total of 553 farmers in three counties across the California
   Central Valley and Central Coast. Overall, we find that < 50\% of the
   farmers surveyed have participated in any SGMA-related events, with
   attending a meeting being the most common (45\%), and testifying before
   a board being the least common (6\%). Participation in any type of SGMA
   policy event was associated with multiple characteristics of the
   groundwater SES context, including the resource system (farm size) and
   actor attributes (farm bureau membership and receiving information about
   the policy), that likely combine to indicate a higher level of social,
   financial, and built capital. Higher participation was also associated
   with higher internal efficacy ratings, i.e., an individual's
   self-assessment of their ability to understand and participate in the
   political process. Higher levels of internal efficacy were also
   correlated with support for both incentive-and regulatory-based policy
   mechanisms, as well as the perception that groundwater impacts are
   occurring now or soon, and exclusive reliance on groundwater. These

Abstract = {The focus of much research in behavioral decision theory on individual
   behavior in static and discrete tasks has limited the penetration of
   psychological perspectives in theories of aggregate dynamics such as the
   behavior of markets, firms, and other economic systems.
   In the paper, an experiment in a simple social-ecological system is
   designed to investigate how people develop intentions and handle
   information feedback. The aim is to test that if more available
   information would help in making decisions. Statistic analysis results
   show that people do perform better when given more information. But the
   performance is still far from the optimal solution.},

Abstract = {In recent decades, human activities have moved beyond the range of
   natural variability and are approaching critical tipping points that may
   lead to irreversible changes to the Earth's systems. In particular, the
   diversity of actors and scales, and their power and interest in Earth
   system resources, increases natural social interconnectivity and the
   vulnerability of these traditionally local resource systems to
   disturbances. Using a combination of design conditions and robustness
   analyses, we argue that institutional maturity and local knowledge of
   self-organised regimes are pre-conditions for the continuity of local
   forest socio-ecological systems as long-lasting institutions that
   survive global market disturbances. Vulnerability and robustness against
   external natural and social disturbances thus largely depend on
   institutional robustness, as well as socioecological dynamics. (C) 2016

Title = {Social and ecological effectiveness of large marine protected areas},
Journal = {GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {43},
Pages = {82-91},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Large marine protected areas are increasingly being established to meet
   global conservation targets and promote sustainable use of resources.
   Although the factors affecting the performance of small-scale marine
   protected areas are relatively well studied, there is no such body of
   knowledge for large marine protected areas. We conducted a global
   meta-analysis to systematically investigate social, ecological, and
   governance characteristics of successful large marine protected areas
   with respect to several social and ecological outcomes. We included all
   large (>10,000 km(2)), implemented (>5 years of active management)
   marine protected areas that had sufficient data for analysis, for a
   total of twelve cases. We used the Social Ecological Systems
   Meta-Analysis Database, and a consistent protocol for using secondary
   data and key informant interviews, to code proxies for fisheries,
   ecosystem health, and the wellbeing of user groups (mainly fishers). We
   tested four sets of hypotheses derived from the literature on
   small-scale marine protected areas and common-pool resources: (i) the
   attributes of species and ecosystems to be managed in the marine
   protected area, (ii) adherence to principles for designing small-scale
   marine protected areas, (iii) adherence to the design principles for
   common-pool resource management, and (iv) stakeholder participation. We
   found varying levels of support for these hypotheses. Improved fisheries
   were associated with older marine protected areas, and higher levels of
   enforcement. Declining fisheries were associated with several ecological
   and economic factors, including low productivity, high mobility, and
   high market value. High levels of participation were correlated with
   improvements in wellbeing and ecosystem health trends. Overall, this
   study constitutes an important first step in identifying factors
   affecting social wellbeing and ecological performance of large marine
   protected areas. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Social-ecological innovation in remote mountain areas: Adaptive
   responses of forest-dependent communities to the challenges of a
   changing world},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {613},
Pages = {894-906},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {To better understand how constantly changing human-environment
   interactions could be better organized to respond to current challenges,
   we examined the Ukrainian Carpathians as an example case of complex
   forest social-ecological systems (FSES). We did it by interviewing
   diverse and relevant local stakeholder (N= 450). In particular, we
   strived to: i) outline how people and nature are linked and interact in
   coupled FSES; ii) examine the preferences of stakeholders on the forests
   and associated ecosystem services (ES); iii) map key drivers threatening
   well-being of FSES and iv) identify potential responses to address the
   challenges at a local scale. To answer these questions we followed a
   mixed method route by integrating qualitative (participatory) and
   quantitative data collection and analyses, with further application of a
   Driving Force-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) framework in
   combination with the ES approach in order to assess benefits, threats to
   these benefits, and responses regarding the studied FSES. We found that
   the key benefit from FSES is timber and non-wood forest products (like
   berries and mushrooms), but also various regulating services were ranked
   highly by respondents. To explore social-ecological innovation, with
   potential responses of forest-dependent communities to challenges they
   face, we employed a commonly used assumption that governance must fit to
   the particular characteristics of FSES in order to enable
   sustainability. For the particular case of the Ukrainian Carpathians, we
   identified and discussed the following five nonconformities or
   ``misfits{''} threatening sustainability: 1) Spatialmisfit in
   legislation; 2) Poor contextualization; 3) Trap of the single ES; 4)
   Participatory misfit; and 5) Robbing the commons. By conceptualizing
   those key threats, we proposed responses for sustainability. The
   findings contributed to an advanced understanding of complex FSES, their
   key challenges and potential solutions in order to securewellbeing of
   people and nature in coupled social-ecological systems, in the
   conditions of a changing world. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   an Integrated Social-Ecological System},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {Improving household livelihoods through tourism, while at the same time
   achieving the goals of conservation, remains a challenge in high-value
   nature areas around the world. This paper studies a
   herder-community-based tourism system in Mongolia in light of these
   challenges. The social-ecological system (SES) framework was used as a
   conceptual foundation. The generic SES framework was adapted to the case
   of the herder-community-based tourism system. The adapted framework was
   then used to assess the economic, ecological, and social objectives of
   the herder-community-based tourism system characterised by natural
   resources and cultural landscapes. Primary data collection included
   interviews with key informants in the tourism sector: tourism
   researchers, representatives of donor projects, managers of tour
   operators, and guides. Based on their responses, the study site was
   selected in the buffer zone of the Hustai National Park, which is a
   protected area. Respondents in the second stage of interviews were
   herders who participate in herder-based tourism and who live in the
   vicinity of the protected area. Results show that the SES framework is
   able to diagnose the sustainability of the herder-community-tourism
   system, but sustainability outcomes indicate an imbalance between
   social, economic, and environmental performance. The
   herder-community-based tourism system is successful in conserving
   wildlife and habitats; however, the distribution of revenues gained from
   tourism shows that only a small and inequitable share reaches the herder
   community.},

Title = {Foundations of sustainability information representation theory:

Abstract = {A critical need exists to broaden and deepen sustainability information
   foundations that can foster growth of actionable knowledge about
   human-environment relations to address grand challenges in sustainable
   system domains such as sustainable development, social-ecological
   systems, and hazards influencing global environmental change.
   Broad-based information is needed to integrate across domains to address
   sustainability problems cast as complex systems problems that vary
   widely across space and time. Deep-based information is needed to
   address nuanced and contextual relationships that exist within and
   across domains. Both broad and deep information together are needed to
   better address spatial-temporal dynamics in complex sustainable systems.
   According to many publications, the concept of sustainable systems is
   considered to be at the core of self-organizing systems; and in turn,
   the concept of self-organizing systems is at the core of
   social-ecological systems, coupled natural-human systems, and
   human-environment systems. The sustainable systems concept is elucidated
   in terms of ontological and epistemological foundations from geographic
   information representation theory. A framework for Measurement-informed
   Ontology and Epistemology for Sustainability Information Representation,
   drawing from research about ontology and epistemology in geographic
   information science, provides the foundation for elucidating concepts
   and relations about sustainability information representation in general
   and sustainable systems in particular. The framework is developed to
   form a core of sustainability information representation theory, and
   consequently provides a basis for articulating first principles about
   the character of space-time data models that can be used to create
   computational models within geographic information systems (GIS). An
   example applies the framework to common pool resources as sustainable
   systems. Developing the framework and exploring an example fosters
   intellectual bridge building between sustainability science and
   sustainability management in the form of a sustainability information
   science. That intellectual bridge building of sustainability information
   science supports societal progress moving knowledge into decision action
   toward sustainable development, encouraging new insight for designs of
   space-time data models, and extending GIS as an information technology
   foundation for sustainability management. Conclusions and directions for
   next steps in research about sustainability information representation
   theory in general and sustainable systems in particular are offered.},

Abstract = {Real world observations suggest that social norms of cooperation can be
   effective in overcoming social dilemmas such as the joint management of
   a common pool resource-but also that they can be subject to slow erosion

   emerge endogenously in a model of a closed community harvesting a
   renewable natural resource in which individual agents face the
   temptation to overexploit the resource, while a cooperative harvesting
   norm spreads through the community via interpersonal relations. We
   analyze under what circumstances small changes in key parameters
   (including the size of the community, and the rate of technological
   progress) trigger catastrophic transitions from relatively high levels
   of cooperation to widespread norm violation-causing the
   social-ecological system to collapse. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {A set of freshwater fisheries management institutions in the central
   Brazilian Amazon leads us to propose an expansion of the common pool
   resource (CPR) management models developed by Ostrom. We analyze the
   origins and effectiveness of a community-based CPR system that has
   emerged despite several features that are, in Ostrom's view, barriers to
   local institutional development: the fish populations are migratory
   rather than stationary, spatial boundaries are ambiguous rather than
   fixed, and state support of local management is weak or non-existent
   rather than strong. We argue that cultural and political factors, which
   are given less emphasis in Ostrom's model, may help explain how these
   communities overcome barriers to collective action. We draw parallels
   between freshwater systems and Marine Protected Areas and discuss
   implications for local resource management.},

Title = {Tipping Points of Space Debris in Low Earth Orbit},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE COMMONS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {18},
Number = {1},
Pages = {17-31},
Abstract = {Global services like navigation, communication, and Earth observation
   have increased dramatically in the 21st century due to advances in outer
   space industries. But as orbits become increasingly crowded with both
   satellites and inevitable space debris pollution, continued operations
   become endangered by the heightened risks of debris collisions in orbit.
   Kessler Syndrome is the term for when a critical threshold of orbiting
   debris triggers a runaway positive feedback loop of debris collisions,
   creating debris congestion that can render orbits unusable. As this
   potential tipping point becomes more widely recognized, there have been
   renewed calls for debris mitigation and removal. Here, we combine
   complex systems and social -ecological systems approaches to study how
   these efforts may affect space debris accumulation and the likelihood of
   reaching Kessler Syndrome. Specifically, we model how debris levels are
   affected by future launch rates, cleanup activities, and collisions
   between extant debris. We contextualize and interpret our dynamic model
   within a discussion of existing space debris governance and other
   social, economic, and geopolitical factors that may influence effective
   collective management of the orbital commons. In line with previous
   studies, our model finds that debris congestion may be reached in less
   than 200 years, though a holistic management strategy combining removal
   and mitigation actions can avoid such outcomes while continuing space
   activities. Moreover, although active debris removal may be particularly
   effective, the current lack of market and governance support may impede
   its implementation. Research into these critical dynamics and the multi
   -faceted variables that influence debris outcomes can support
   policymakers in curating impactful governance strategies and realistic
   transition pathways to sustaining debris -free orbits. Overall, our
   study is useful for communicating about space debris sustainability in
   policy and education settings by providing an exploration of policy
   portfolio options supported by a simple and clear social -ecological
   modeling approach.},

Title = {Mechanisms of resilience in common-pool resource management systems:: an
   agent-based model of water use in a river basin},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {12},
Number = {2},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The concept of resilience is widely promoted as a promising notion to
   guide new approaches to ecosystem and resource management that try to
   enhance a system's capacity to cope with change. A variety of mechanisms
   of resilience specific for different systems have been proposed. In the
   context of resource management those include but are not limited to the
   diversity of response options and flexibility of the social system to
   adaptively respond to changes on an adequate scale. However,
   implementation of resilience-based management in specific real-world
   systems has often proven difficult because of a limited understanding of
   suitable interventions and their impact on the resilience of the coupled
   social-ecological system. We propose an agent-based modeling approach to
   explore system characteristics and mechanisms of resilience in a complex
   resource management system, based on a case study of water use in the
   Amudarya River, which is a semiarid river basin. Water resources in its
   delta are used to sustain irrigated agriculture as well as aquatic
   ecosystems that provide fish and other ecosystem services. The three
   subsystems of the social-ecological system, i.e., the social system, the
   irrigation system, and an aquatic ecosystem, are linked by resource
   flows and the allocation decision making of actors on different levels.
   Simulation experiments are carried out to compare the resilience of
   different institutional settings of water management to changes in the
   variability and uncertainty of water availability. The aim is to
   investigate the influence of ( 1) the organizational structure of water
   management, ( 2) information on water availability, and ( 3) the
   diversity of water uses on the resilience of the system to short and
   long-term water scarcity. In this paper, the model concept and first
   simulation results are presented. As a first illustration of the
   approach the performances of a centralized and a decentralized regime
   are compared under different scenarios of information on water
   availability. Under the given conditions of a regularly fluctuating
   inflow and compliance of agents with orders from a national authority,
   the centralized system performs better as long as irrigation is the only
   type of water use. Diversification of resource use, e. g., irrigation
   and fishing, increases the performance of the decentralized regime and
   the resilience of both. Systematic analysis of the performance of
   different system structures will help to identify properties and
   mechanisms of resilience. This understanding will be valuable for the
   identification, development, and evaluation of management interventions
   in specific river basins.},

Volume = {454},

Abstract = {Harvesting behaviors of natural resource users, such as farmers,
   fishermen and aquaculturists, are shaped by season-to-season and
   day-to-day variability, or in other words risk. Here, we explore how
   risk mitigation strategies can lead to sustainable use and improved
   management of common-pool natural resources. Over-exploitation of
   unmanaged natural resources, which lowers their long-term productivity,
   is a central challenge facing societies. While effective top-down
   management is a possible solution, it is not available if the resource
   is outside the jurisdictional bounds of any management entity, or if
   existing institutions cannot effectively impose sustainable-use rules.
   Under these conditions, alternative approaches to natural resource
   governance are required. Here, we study revenue-sharing clubs as a
   mechanism by which resource users can mitigate their income volatility
   and importantly, as a co-benefit, are also incentivized to reduce their
   effort, leading to reduced over-exploitation and improved resource
   governance. We use game theoretic analyses and agent-based modeling to
   determine the conditions in which revenue-sharing can be beneficial for
   resource management as well as resource users. We find that
   revenue-sharing agreements can emerge and lead to improvements in
   resource management when there is large variability in
   production/revenue and when this variability is uncorrelated across
   members of the revenue-sharing club. Further, we show that if members of
   the revenue-sharing collective can sell their product at a price
   premium, then the range of ecological and economic conditions under
   which revenue-sharing can be a tool for management greatly expands.
   These results have implications for the design of bottom-up management,
   where resource users themselves are incentivized to operate in
   ecologically sustainable and economically advantageous ways. (C) 2018

Abstract = {In this paper, we examine how the 2008-2009 drought in northern Tanzania
   contributed to and catalyzed the transformation of governance concerning
   the management of natural resources from traditional informal
   institutions among the Maasai to formal village-based institutions. Our
   central argument is that village governance in northern Tanzania
   represents a new, formal institution that is supplementing and in some
   important ways obviating traditional, informal institutions. Further,
   this replacement is central to what appears to be a transformation of

Title = {Can the Indonesian Collective Action Norm of Gotong-Royong Be
   Strengthened with Economic Incentives? Comparing the Implementation of
   an Aquaculture Irrigation Policy Program},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE COMMONS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {17},
Number = {1},
Pages = {462-480},
Abstract = {The Indonesian multi-level governmental program (PITAP) is a
   participatory pond irrigation management policy established by the
   Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries. It aims to catalyze the
   rehabilitation of irrigation canals to improve water access for
   small-scale aquaculture farmers. In PITAP, traditional aquaculture
   farmers are incentivized with government funding to create
   community-based co-management groups (POKLINA), to maintain the
   self-governance of their irrigation canals. The logic of PITAP is to
   encourage POKLINA farmers to rehabilitate their irrigation canals
   through subsidized labor payments that are coupled with strengthening
   the strong cultural norm of mutual assistance (i.e., collective action)
   within Indonesian society called Gotong-Royong. PITAP aims to revitalize
   Gotong-Royong through subsidized labor compensation with the hope that
   when the subsidy program is over, Gotong-Royong will be revitalized
   without external support. In this study, we compare and analyze four
   villages on Lombok, Indonesia, that participated in PITAP program in
   2020 and 2021. The study is supported with empirical data using various
   qualitative data collection methods, including interviews, participant
   observations, and the collection of policy documents. We further use the
   Social-Ecological System Framework (SESF) as a diagnostic tool to
   structure the data collection process and analysis. Findings indicate
   that different variables hinder and enable collective action in the four
   villages, leading to different PITAP program outcomes. The likely reason
   for this, suggested by our findings, is that each village has different
   social and ecological conditions that influence intrinsic motivation for
   collective action. PITAP program either crowds out intrinsic motivation
   under some conditions or crowds it in under others. This suggests the
   need to consider contextual adaptations in policy design and
   implementation to improve outcomes better.},

   order to analyse these conservation challenges, the article uses
   DiGaetano and Strom's framework on urban governance to identify and

   research, this research argues that three modes of governance
   (managerial, clientelist and populist) characterize the city's lake
   system. Conflict amongst these modes of governance, which often act at
   cross-purposes to each other, may be one of the reasons why Bangalore
   has been unable to protect its lakes.},

Title = {Moving beyond panaceas: a multi-tiered diagnostic approach for
   social-ecological analysis},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {37},
Number = {4},
Pages = {451-463},
Abstract = {Disturbances to key aspects of ecological systems, including
   biodiversity loss, climate change, pollution and natural resource
   degradation, have become a major concern to many policy analysts.
   Instead of learning from the study of biological complexity however,
   social scientists tend to recommend simple panaceas, particularly
   government or private ownership, as `the' way to solve these problems.
   This paper reviews and assesses potential solutions for such overly
   simplified institutional prescriptions, referred to here as the `panacea
   problem'. In contrast to these simple prescriptions, recent research
   efforts are now illustrating the diversity of institutions around the
   world related to environmental conservation. The complexity of working
   institutions, however, presents a challenge to scholars who equate
   scientific knowledge with relatively simple models that predict optimal
   performance if specific institutional arrangements are in place. Dealing
   with this complexity has led to the development of frameworks as
   meta-theoretical tools. The institutional analysis and development (IAD)
   framework has been used over the last three decades as a foundation for
   a focused analysis of how institutions affect human incentives, actions
   and outcomes. Building on this foundation, the social-ecological systems
   (SES) framework has recently enabled researchers to begin the
   development of a common language that crosses social and ecological
   disciplines to analyse how interactions among a variety of factors
   affect outcomes. Such a framework may be able to facilitate a diagnostic
   approach that will help future analysts overcome the panacea problem.
   Using a common framework to diagnose the source, and possible
   amelioration, of poor outcomes for ecological and human systems enables
   a much finer understanding of these complex systems than has so far been
   obtained, and provides a basis for comparisons among many systems and
   ultimately more responsible policy prescriptions.},

Abstract = {We investigated the coupled social and ecological dynamics of swidden
   agriculture through a common property resource field experiment framed
   as a game with realistic social norms and ecological dynamics. We tested
   the hypothesis that community social norms related to labor reciprocity
   and graduated sanctioning may encourage sustainable swidden cultivation.
   We played the game with 150 people from two Q'eqchi' Maya villages in
   southern Belize where swidden agriculture is common. We found that when
   the game mimics local social norms related to agricultural labor
   exchange, clearing requests decrease and a statistical analysis
   indicates that players sanctioned one another in order to decrease
   resource use and increase sustainability. We validated our results using
   qualitative methods, post-game surveys, and interviews, and we conclude
   that cultural and social norms related to labor exchange improve the
   sustainability of swidden agriculture.},

Title = {Overfishing Drivers and Opportunities for Recovery in Small-Scale
   Fisheries of the Midriff Islands Region, Gulf of California, Mexico: the
   Roles of Land and Sea Institutions in Fisheries Sustainability},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {19},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Institutions play an important role in shaping individual incentives in
   complex social-ecological systems, by encouraging or discouraging
   resource overuse. In the Gulf of California, Mexico, there is widespread
   evidence of declines in small-scale fishery stocks, largely attributed
   to policy failures. We investigated formal and informal rules-in-use
   regulating access and resource use by small-scale fishers in the two
   most important fishing communities of the Midriff Islands region in the
   Gulf of California, which share several target species and fishing
   grounds. The Midriff Islands region is a highly productive area where
   sustainable use of fisheries resources has been elusive. Our study aimed
   to inform policy by providing information on how management and
   conservation policies perform in this unique environment. In addition,
   we contrast attributes of the enabling conditions for sustainability on
   the commons in an effort to better understand why these communities,
   albeit showing several contrasting attributes of the above conditions,
   have not developed sustainable fishing practices. We take a novel,
   comprehensive institutional approach that includes formal and informal
   institutions, incorporating links between land (i.e., communal land
   rights) and sea institutions (i.e., fisheries and conservation policies)
   and their effects on stewardship of fishery resources, a theme that is
   practically unaddressed in the literature. Insufficient government
   support in provision of secure rights, enforcement and sanctioning, and
   recognition and incorporation of local arrangements and capacities for
   management arose as important needs to address in both cases. We
   highlight the critical role of higher levels of governance, that when
   disconnected from local practices, realities, and needs, can be a major
   impediment to achieving sustainability in small-scale fisheries, even in
   cases where several facilitating conditions are met.},

Abstract = {Under what conditions are irrigators able to develop adaptive governance
   arrangements? This article addresses this question by developing an
   empirically grounded theory of self-governance of a snowmelt commons in
   southern Colorado. Drawing on previous work in collective action and
   institutional theory, we argue that self-regulation of the hydro-commons
   is driven by changes in shared user perceptions with regard to the
   salience and scarcity of the resource, as well as the perceived
   probability of salvaging the resource system. We further posit that
   several conditioning factors affect the likelihood of effective local
   responses, including the existing institutional arrangements for
   self-governance, techno-institutional complementarities, and vested
   interests. We test and refine our theoretical argument by conducting a
   historical analysis of regional responses to hydrologic, social, and
   institutional disturbances in Colorado's San Luis Valley.},

   resource users. Our experiments show that subjects are more likely to
   over-harvest when resource flows are high. But group punishment
   mechanisms that rely on social ostracism (as opposed to fines or fees)
   are more effective at mediating the desire to over-harvest when
   resources are booming. This suggests that collective management systems
   based on social norms, exclusion, and ostracism may be more resilient to
   unexpected changes in resource dynamics and supports bottom-up, as
   opposed to top-down, management of common pool resources.},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The influence of many factors on ecological success in common pool
   resource management is still unclear. This may be due to methodological
   issues. These include causal complexity, a lack of large-N-studies, and
   non-linear relationships between factors. We address all three issues
   with a new methodological approach, artificial neural networks, which is
   discussed in detail. It allows us to develop a model with comparably
   high predictive power. In addition, two success factors are analyzed:
   legal security and institutional fairness. Both factors show a positive
   impact on success in irrigation and fisheries supporting the view that
   there are sector-independent success factors. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {Natural ecosystems provide an attractive focus for tourism on small
   islands. However, at the same time tourism and other human actions can
   be detrimental to these ecosystems especially because governance of the
   ecosystem may be difficult due to the limited resilience of small island
   ecosystems. In this paper, we focus on the conditions under which
   self-governance will be the appropriate governance mechanism of
   ecosystem services on small islands. We apply Ostrom's (2009) framework
   for common-pool resources in a social ecological system, and select the
   relevant indicators for small islands. We scored these indicators for
   three cases (environmental issues) in St. Eustatius, a Caribbean island
   under Dutch rule. These cases show that self-organization of ecosystem
   services is not an outcome easily achieved. The unevenly distributed
   benefits of potential measures are found to decrease community support
   of measures that could reinforce these ecosystem services.},

Title = {Agricultural intensification and risk in water-constrained hard-rock
   regions: a social-ecological systems study of horticulture cultivation
   in western India},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {25},
Number = {4},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Developing countries frequently find their poverty reduction initiatives
   to be at odds with promotion of sustainable practices. In India too,
   agricultural intensification through horticulture cultivation is an
   important government strategy to raise farm incomes but its mechanisms
   and implications have not been critically analyzed. Our objective is to
   characterize this intensification and explore conditions under which its
   goals may be achieved while ensuring equity in access to ecological
   services and resilience of the social-ecological system (SES). Our focal
   SES is the water-constrained farm system of western India that overlays
   shallow hard-rock aquifers common to the Indian peninsula. We document
   farm decisions and coping strategies of 121 farmers over two consecutive
   years: a drought year and a good rainfall year. We find that farmers are
   driven to high-value horticulture to remain economically viable in the
   face of increasing social-ecological vulnerability due to factors such
   as monsoon variability, high groundwater development, and uncertainty in
   irrigation access. Through systems modeling, we uncover the feedback
   loops that propagate risk. Risk in access to water, in part due to
   monsoon dry spells, starts a cycle of expensive investments often
   requiring large loans to assure access and a simultaneous move to
   horticulture in response to the elevated cost of water. This mitigates
   risk for the farmer in the short run but, in the absence of regulation
   and complete information about the common groundwater pool, leads to
   competitive investments, driving the regime to greater uncertainty
   levels for the entire community. This vicious cycle of investment and
   intensification escalates risk, leading to frequent crop failure, farmer
   indebtedness, and the tragedy of the commons. Government interventions
   further catalyze this. We propose alternate leverage points to enhance
   social comprehension of risk and facilitate collective action so as to
   negotiate room for human needs while remaining within biophysical
   boundaries.},

Title = {Lock-ins to transition pathways anchored in contextualized cooperative
   dynamics: Insights from the historical trajectories of the Walloon dairy
   cooperatives},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {94},
Pages = {161-176},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Drawing on a historical study of the Walloon dairy cooperatives, this
   paper analyses how complex cooperative dynamics define lock-ins in their
   trajectories. We consider cooperatives as firms active on markets and as
   structures of collective action gathering farmers-members around common
   strategic goals. Williamson's framework from New Institutional Economics
   accounts for the embeddedness of firms' strategies and governance in
   their wider context of development. Under the influence of this context
   of development, Ostrom's IAD (Institutional Analysis and Development)
   and SES (Social-Ecological Systems) frameworks, merged in a so-called
   CIS framework, capture the dynamic interplay between the components of
   cooperatives. Resorting to a combination between these frameworks, this
   paper discusses how the interplay between the components of the
   cooperatives' social-ecological system unfolded in the trajectories of
   the Walloon dairy cooperatives over the last sixty years. We uncover a
   double social dilemma at play. On the part of the farmers, the social
   dilemma anchors itself in the tension between their short-term interests
   as milk supplier over those of principal investor. On the part of the
   cooperatives' directors, the social dilemma anchors itself in the
   features of linking and bridging social capital in the region,
   unfavourable to inter-cooperative dialogue. In the Walloon Region, these
   social dilemma constituted a structural driver of the competition
   between dairy cooperatives and the subsequent inability to cooperate and
   invest towards successful long-term diversification pathways. We discuss
   how contextual factors, in particular market features, regulatory
   frameworks, socio-political features, and institutional support to
   dialogue, may aggravate, or conversely mitigate the effect of these
   social dilemma on cooperatives' trajectories. We call for more
   historically-informed studies on the impact of context on cooperative
   dynamics and stress the relevance of contextualized approaches to unlock
   prospective dynamics of collective agency in transition pathways.},

Abstract = {Drawing on the literature, this paper examines a set of criteria for
   successful adaptive governance of the commons from an entrepreneurial
   perspective. These criteria or success factors are definition and
   boundaries, regulation, learning and training, decision-making
   processes, and participation of different agents interested in the
   commons. These success factors are assessed and ranked. Multiple
   criteria decision analysis is used to assess and rank these success
   factors of adaptive governance of the commons. More specifically, the
   analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is used to weight each criteria and
   sub-criteria. This study sheds light on the role of organisational
   learning and knowledge management in contexts where the commons are at
   stake. The results indicate that regulation is the most important
   criterion for adaptive governance of the commons. Correctly establishing
   decision-making processes and implementing effective learning and
   training are key success factors of common resource governance.},

Title = {A mixed-methods approach to assessing success in transitioning water
   management institutions: a case study of the Platte River Basin,
   Nebraska},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {20},

Abstract = {To address increasing conflicts between surface water and groundwater
   users, the state of Nebraska has adopted a more localized and integrated
   approach in managing water resources. Integrated approaches offer
   promise in better managing connected water resources within the state;
   however, little review of the potential benefits and/ or challenges of
   these actions has been conducted. This case study uses both qualitative
   and quantitative data collection efforts to take an in-depth look at how
   this new and innovative management system is working through the eyes of
   stakeholders living and working in the basin. Data collection reveals
   that overall the current water management system is working relatively
   well, even though it is still in its infancy. However, the system could
   be further improved by ensuring all that stakeholder interests are
   represented, providing increased opportunities to participate, and
   continuing to work toward more holistic and proactive water management.},

Abstract = {Self-governance can be a suitable instrument for the community-based
   management of a common pool resource (CPR). Under self-governance,
   individuals may organize themselves for the use of a CPR, a lake in our
   case study, to deal with problems of overexploitation and low profits
   that arise due to open access. Unlike most of previous research, which
   are ex-post in nature, this research explores the feasibility and
   desirability of carrying out an ex-ante assessment of the potential for
   self-governance to manage a CPR. Taking a set of theoretical conditions,
   this research proposes a way to assess the CPR users' perception on the
   adoption of self-governance. It represents a step toward understanding a
   priori whether self-governance would be feasible or not.},

   basis for reviewing the literature on resource governance, including
   both points of consensus and contentious issues. We argue that no fixed
   spatial or temporal level is appropriate for governing ecosystems and
   their services sustainably, effectively, and equitably. Cafe point to
   the need to recognize the multilevel nature of such problems and the
   role Of institutions in facilitating cross-level environmental
   governance as an important form of social capital that is essential for
   the long-term protection of ecosystems and the well-being of different

Abstract = {The emergence of `new commons' poses theoretical challenges that require
   empirical efforts and in-depth case studies. Three years of ethnographic
   work at an Ecuadorian coastal community brings us to propose the
   emergence of a new commons, historically born from an unstructured group
   of inhabitants, and refunded as a community seemingly able to convert a
   degraded socio-ecological system into a more sustainable configuration.
   To understand this process, we study how institutions and rules
   developed for the environmental management of strategic common pool
   resources (CPRs), transforming human-environment relationships. This
   socio-ecosystem constitutes a co-managed multi-level system of
   governance, developed through a community building process and a
   particular community based tourism model. Its analysis suggests that the
   balanced development of different levels of management with a firm base
   at the community level bringing into play new CPRs, can be key factors
   for the emergence of new commons.},

   digitalism in the governance of shared solar energy in Australia},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {60},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {This article argues that the need for a better understanding of
   socio-technical interactions in shared renewable energy systems (SRESs)
   is exacerbated by the relevance of digital technologies to their
   governance. Addressing the question of how the use of digital technology
   affects system governance, this study applies the social-ecological
   system framework to a case study in Perth, Western Australia. The
   analysis finds that although the digital element enables the sharing of
   energy in the case study, it also increases the complexity of the social
   subsystem. While technology is often heralded as the solution,
   successful governance of digitally enabled SRESs may be more dependent
   on recognizing the importance and complexity of social interactions
   needed to manage the technology. The findings of the study are useful in
   developing and implementing appropriate governance mechanisms for SRESs
   in Australia and other parts of the world.},

Abstract = {A revised application of Ostrom's (Ostrom, 2007) Social-Ecological
   System (SES) framework to Hardin's `tragedy of the commons' (Hardin, G.
   (1968), Science, 162(3859): 1243-1248) demonstrates that its
   institutional structure is more complex than either Hardin or Ostrom had
   imagined. The `tragedy' arises from several interacting resources and
   institutions. If the grass on the pasture was not subject to
   appropriation, the cattle were not privately owned, or property-and
   contract-enforcement institutions supporting market exchange were
   absent, then the `tragedy of the commons' would not have arisen
   regardless of the open-access pasture. This paper highlights the utility
   of the SES framework and the care required to apply it precisely to
   specific social-ecological situations.},

Abstract = {In an effort to deliver better outcomes for people and the ecosystems
   they depend on, many governments and civil society groups are engaging
   natural resource users in collaborative management arrangements
   (frequently called comanagement). However, there are few empirical
   studies demonstrating the social and institutional conditions conducive
   to successful comanagement outcomes, especially in small-scale
   fisheries. Here, we evaluate 42 comanagement arrangements across five
   countries and show that: (i) comanagement is largely successful at
   meeting social and ecological goals; (ii) comanagement tends to benefit
   wealthier resource users; (iii) resource overexploitation is most
   strongly influenced by market access and users' dependence on resources;
   and (iv) institutional characteristics strongly influence livelihood and
   compliance outcomes, yet have little effect on ecological conditions.},

Abstract = {In complex social-ecological systems, multiple agents with diverse
   objectives take actions that affect the long-term dynamics of the
   system. Common pool resources are a subset of such systems, where
   property rights are typically poorly defined and dynamics are unknown a
   priori, creating a social dilemma reflected by the well-known `tragedy
   of the commons.' In this paper, we investigated the efficacy of deep
   reinforcement learning in a multi-agent setting of a common pool
   resource system. We used an abstract mathematical model of the system,
   represented as a partially-observable general-sum Markov game. In the
   first set of experiments, the independent agents used a deep Q-Network
   with discrete action spaces to guide decision-making. However,
   significant shortcomings were evident. Consequently, in a second set of
   experiments, a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient learning model with
   continuous state and action spaces guided agent learning. Simulation
   results show that agents performed significantly better in terms of both
   sustainability and economic goals when using the second deep learning
   model. Despite the fact that agents do not have perfect foresight nor
   understanding of the implications of their `harvesting' efforts, deep
   reinforcement learning can be used effectively to `learn in the
   commons.'},

Title = {Self-governance mediates small-scale fishing strategies, vulnerability

Journal = {GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {84},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {As global change accelerates, natural resource-dependent communities
   must respond and adapt. Small-scale fisheries, essential for coastal
   livelihoods and food security, are considered among the most vulnerable
   of these coupled social-ecological systems. While previous studies have
   examined vulnerability and adaptation in fisheries at the individual,
   household, and community level, these scales of organization are
   inconsistent with many of the legal and regulatory frameworks that
   function in practice to mediate behavior, decision-making, and
   adaptation. Here, we use cooperative- and privately-owned fishing
   enterprises in Northwest Mexico as a case study to examine how different
   forms of marine self-governance experience and respond to climate
   shocks. Leveraging social-ecological network methods to examine changes
   in fisheries participation and vulnerability during a recent period of
   pronounced regional oceanographic change, our analysis suggests that: 1)
   different forms of SSF self-governance (and the fishing strategies and
   harvest portfolios with which they are associated) help determine the
   impacts of and response to environmental change; and 2) that there may
   be important tradeoffs between short-term responses which function to
   prevent or mitigate lost fishing revenue and long-term changes in
   climate vulnerability. In particular large fishing cooperatives,
   predicted to be highly vulnerable on the basis of network theoretic
   metrics, exceeded expectations (maintaining or increasing resource
   revenues) while demonstrating a degree of path dependency that may
   function to increase sensitivity and undermine resilience as climate
   change progresses. In providing an empirical evaluation of how
   self-governance arrangements characterized by different group sizes,
   access regimes and levels of cooperation respond to system perturbation,
   we aim to advance common pool resource theory while offering targeted
   guidance for the development of more nuanced and equitable climate
   adaptation policies.},

Pages = {495-516},
Abstract = {Institutions, the rules of the game that shape repeated human
   interactions, clearly play a critical role in helping groups avoid the
   inefficient use of shared resources such as fisheries, freshwater, and
   the assimilative capacity of the environment. Institutions, however, are
   intimately intertwined with the human, social, and biophysical context
   within which they operate. Scholars typically are careful to take this
   context into account when studying institutions and Ostrom's
   Institutional Design Principles are a case in point. Scholars have
   tested whether Ostrom's Design Principles, which specify broad
   relationships between institutional arrangements and context, actually
   support successful governance of shared resources. This article further
   contributes to this line of research by leveraging the notion of
   institutional design to outline a research trajectory focused on coupled
   infrastructure systems in which institutions are seen as one class of
   infrastructure among many that dynamically interact to produce outcomes
   over time.},

Journal = {GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {41},
Pages = {13-25},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {This interdisciplinary paper presents an empirical analysis of
   techno-institutional lock-in in a regional fishery, in the Logone
   floodplain in the Far North Region of Cameroon. In the Logone
   floodplain, one fishing technique is spreading exponentially even though
   it is changing the social, hydrological and ecological dynamics of the
   system in ways that are largely considered problematic by local
   communities. We use a complex systems framework to analyze large
   hydrological and socio-economic datasets. Results show how
   social-ecological feedbacks foster the spread of the technique and
   contribute to the process of lock-in. The lock-in leads to a resistance
   to change despite awareness of the technique's impact, a situation that
   may also be described as a social-ecological trap. We identify and
   explain four kinds of positive feedback loops relating to
   socio-economic, behavioral, demographic and hydrological processes,
   respectively. We also identify possible solutions that consider the
   complexity of the feedback loops across multiple dimensions of the
   floodplain system. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {A new approach to agent-based models of Community Resource Management
   based on the analysis of cheating, monitoring, and sanctioning},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MODELLING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {468},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Community-based natural resource management (CBNRM) has the potential to
   conserve resources while si-multaneously empowering traditionally
   marginalized communities. Because classical equation-based modeling
   methods fail to capture the complexity of CBNRM, Agent-Based Modeling
   (ABM) has emerged as a useful method for modeling these systems. In this
   paper, we begin with a careful evaluation and sensitivity analysis of an
   existing ABM of community forest management that incorporates cheating
   and enforcement which we call the Cheating and Enforcement model. Our
   results reveal several emergent behaviors of the model that are
   paradoxical or inconsistent with real-world expectations. We then
   introduce the Monitoring and Sanctioning model which makes several
   modifications to the cheating and enforcement mechanisms of the original
   ABM. Analyzing this new model, we see that it does not exhibit several
   of the more unusual behaviors of the original model and reveals
   surprising consistency with real-world CBNRM systems. Finally, we
   discuss some limitations of this new model and potential areas of

Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS},

Volume = {63},
Number = {1},

Month = {JUN 15},
Abstract = {This article presents the conceptual revisions needed to extend the new
   institutional approach to environmental governance from its current
   local and international domains of application to all governance
   solutions, including national environmental and natural resource use
   policies and multi-level governance solutions that are increasingly used
   to address global environmental change. The article suggests that
   environmental governance is best understood as the establishment,
   reaffirmation or change of institutions to resolve conflicts over
   environmental resources. It also explains why the choice of these
   institutions is a matter of social justice rather than of efficiency.
   The article suggests a way to understand formal and state-centered
   governance solutions as forms of collective ownership not unlike common
   property. The article demonstrates how institutional analysis can gain
   resolution by looking at the functional and structural tiers,
   organization of governance functions, and formulation of key
   institutional rules as key aspects of the design of governance
   institutions. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Resilience, Social-Ecological Rules, and Environmental Variability in a

Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {18},
Number = {4},
Abstract = {Social-ecological resilience is an increasingly central paradigm for
   understanding sustainable resource management. In this study, we aimed
   to better understand the effect of environmental variability on the
   resilience of fishery systems, and the important role that social
   institutions and biophysical constraints play. To explore these issues,
   we built a dynamic model of the pen shell fishery of the indigenous Seri
   people in the Gulf of California, Mexico. This model included the
   dynamics of the two dominant species in the fishery (Atrina tuberculosa
   and Pinna rugosa), several institutional rules that the Seri use, and a
   number of ecological constraints, including key stochastic variables
   derived from empirical data. We found that modeling with multiple
   species, rather than the standard species model, uncovered more of the
   resilience that is present in the system. We also found that it is the
   combination of several social-ecological rules working in conjunction
   with the endogenous environmental variability that helps ensure the
   resilience of the system.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the potential of urban commons for
   building community resilience. We focus on the issue of adaptability to
   socio-ecological issues, which depends on the social capital built by
   the local community of practice. We measure this capital through the
   variables of volunteer involvement, perceived trust, and social cohesion
   in an agent-based model, which simulates the dynamics of participation
   in collective activities. We anchor our model with the case of
   KasKantine in Amsterdam, a cooperative and restaurant run by volunteers.
   Our model shows that both trust and social cohesion emerge from the
   interactions in the cooperative, especially when group sizes are kept
   small. This contributes to the adaptability of such social-ecological
   systems, helping their communities build social resilience.},

Volume = {55},

Pages = {3525-3544},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This paper makes an initial contribution towards building a
   polycentricity index to account for the governing of social-ecological
   systems. It develops three indices and an overall index, using an
   approach based on network science, to measure the extent to which actors
   develop ordered relationships to address scale mismatches in urban water
   governance. These indices are discussed with respect to the overarching
   system of rules governing actors' decisions within the Middle Rio Grande
   (MRG) urban watershed. The analysis and discussions herein suggest that
   the governance of the MRG is a predominantly monocentric governing
   system with elements of polycentricity. They also suggest that
   polycentricity in governing the MRG urban water commons could primarily
   be about the politics of power and resource distribution as actors
   reconfigure their positionalities and align themselves and their
   interests strategically. The paper concludes with a succinct discussion
   about how quantitative measures of an overarching system of rules could
   be incorporated into future indices.},

Abstract = {This paper analyzes conflict and collaboration and their relation to
   normative structures based on a case study of the history and external
   interventions of the Pillaro North Canal Irrigation System in the
   Ecuadorian Highlands. It does so by using Ostrom's framework for
   analyzing the sustainability of socioecological systems together with an
   analysis of the normative structures that define the governance systems
   through which the interactions in irrigation systems are mediated. I
   argue that the external interventions by the state and NGOs imposed a
   new governance system that undermined the existing normative structures
   and related organizations, leading to internal conflicts. The case study
   suggests that a reformulation of irrigation policies and state
   intervention methodologies in user managed supra-community irrigation
   systems in the Andes could lead to higher levels of cooperation.},

Title = {Introducing Ecological Dynamics into Common-Pool Resource Experiments},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {15},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {Case-study analysis shows that long-lasting social-ecological systems
   have institutional arrangements regulating where, when, and how to
   appropriate resources instead of how much. Those cases testify to the
   importance of the fit between ecological and institutional dynamics.
   Experiments are increasingly used to study decision making, test
   alternative behavioral models, and test policies. In typical commons
   dilemma experiments, the only possible decision is how much to
   appropriate. Therefore, conventional experiments restrict the option to
   study the interplay between ecological and institutional dynamics. Using
   a new real-time, spatial, renewable resource environment, we can study
   the informal norms that participants develop in an experimental resource
   dilemma setting. Do ecological dynamics affect the institutional
   arrangements they develop? We find that the informal institutions
   developed on when, where, and how to appropriate the resource vary with
   the ecological dynamics in the different treatments. Finally, we find
   that the amount and distribution of communication messages and not the
   content of the communication explains the differences between group
   performances.},

Abstract = {The marine aquarium trade has played an important role in shaping the
   ecological state of coral reefs in Indonesia and much of the
   Asia-Pacific. The use of cyanide by ornamental fishers in Buleleng
   District, Bali, in the 1980s and 1990s has resulted in a precipitous
   decline in the ecological health of reefs. Cyanide-free harvesting
   techniques were introduced after 2000, along with reef restoration
   measures. This paper examines social and ecological processes in the
   fishing village of Les, Bali, in ending the use of cyanide and the
   resulting ecological restoration. An emphasis on
   conservation-development (with livelihood objectives) was important in
   securing interest and cooperation across stakeholder groups. Adaptive
   approaches to governance and knowledge co-production were also
   important. The strategy used at Les is now being exported to other
   communities across Indonesia, and provides a promising example of a
   marine resources-based conservation-development initiative that may be
   implemented at other, similar communities.},

Volume = {34},

Pages = {77-84},

Abstract = {Institutional approaches in natural resource management in general and
   in fisheries in particular seldom address cultural aspects or social
   institutions like kinship. In this study, a broad institutional approach
   is used to investigate the institutionalization of small-scale fisheries
   and seaweed farming in a seagrass dominated bay in Zanzibar. Regulative,
   normative and cultural-cognitive institutions and their rapid/slow
   moving properties are analyzed. The results show that dynamics of
   cooperation and conflict between different institutional elements and
   the balance of forces among actors are crucial to understand fisheries
   management dynamics. Regulations are, despite their importance,
   insufficient to promote sound management if they are not backed up by
   norms and cultural-cognitive institutions. Fisheries management would
   benefit by broadening the institutional perspective to increase the
   efficiency of management and to avoid blueprint solutions. The study
   shows that gaining knowledge about the wide institutional setting takes
   time but the investment is worth it in the long run. (C) 2009 Elsevier

Abstract = {This paper investigates the effectiveness of three WUAs in the arid and
   semi-arid regions of northwest China, drawing upon empirical evidence
   collected through mixed methodologies. Results show significant
   discrepancies between understanding, motives and experiences regarding
   WUAs among different water stakeholders. These discrepancies are
   affected by a complex interaction of a variety of factors, including
   geographical locations, socio-economic and political contexts, personal
   experiences, knowledge gaps, incentives and value systems rather than
   ordinary socio-demographic variables. It has also shown that in a
   traditionally clientelistic society such as China social networks and
   the pattern of relations between different levels (either cooperative or
   exploitative) can be more important in participatory irrigation
   management than the existence of formal institutions or regulation.
   Furthermore, the roles of social networks on water governance are not
   necessarily positive, including collective exploitation, corruption
   especially rent-seeking and collusion. It concludes that for WUAs to be
   effective, they have to be context specific better understanding and
   strategic uses of social networks with shared water motives and goals
   among different stakeholders.},

Title = {Irrigation experiments in the lab: trust, environmental variability, and
   collective action},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {20},
Number = {4},
Abstract = {Research on collective action and common/pool resources is extensive.
   However, little work has concentrated on the effect of variability in
   resource availability and collective action, especially in the context
   of asymmetric access to resources. Earlier works have demonstrated that
   environmental variability often leads to a reduction of collective
   action in the governance of shared resources. Here we assess how
   environmental variability may impact collective action. We performed a
   behavioral experiment involving an irrigation dilemma. In this dilemma
   participants invested first into a public fund that generated water
   resources for the group, which were subsequently appropriated by one
   participant at a time from head end to tail end. The amount of resource
   generated for the given investment level was determined by a payoff
   table and a stochastic event representing environmental variability,
   i.e., rainfall. Results show that that (1) upstream users' behavior is
   by far the most important variable in determining the outcome of
   collective action; (2) environmental variability (i.e. risk level in
   investing in the resource) has little effect on individual investment
   and extraction levels; and (3) the action-reaction feedback is
   fundamental in determining the success or failure of communities.},

Title = {The Influence of Ethnic Diversity on Social Network Structure in a
   Common-Pool Resource System: Implications for Collaborative Management},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {18},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Social networks have recently been identified as key features in
   facilitating or constraining collaborative arrangements that can enhance
   resource governance and adaptability in complex social-ecological
   systems. Nonetheless, the effect of ethnicity on social network
   structure in an ethnically diverse common-pool resource system is
   virtually unknown. We characterize the entire social network of Hawaii's
   longline fishery, an ethnically diverse competitive pelagic fishery, and
   investigate network homophily, network structure, and cross-scale
   linkages. Results show that ethnicity significantly influences social
   network structure and is responsible for a homophily effect, which can
   create challenges for stakeholder collaboration across groups. Our
   analysis also suggests that ethnicity influences the formation of
   diverse network structures, and can affect the level of linkages to
   outside industry leaders, government or management officials, and
   members of the scientific community. This study provides the first
   empirical examination of the impact of ethnic diversity on resource
   user's social networks in the common-pool resource literature, having
   important implications for collaborative resource management.},

Abstract = {FishBanks, a well-known fisheries management simulation game, was used
   to test the effect of institutional settings on the biological and
   economic performance of fisheries. The game was played by 48 groups of
   between 20 and 25 undergraduate Environmental Science students in two
   different time lengths (10 years versus 15 years) and institutional
   settings (open access versus regulated access through a resource
   management regime). Sessions run under an institutional regime for
   resource management performed better than those under open access in
   terms of fish population, aggregate asset value and income distribution
   amongst competing companies. Fleet size, a proxy for human pressure on
   the resource, had a more intense effect than the existence or not of an
   institutional setting. Results also indicate that once a critical
   threshold is reached in stock deterioration, institutions may be
   insufficient to revert change, suggesting ultimate environmental limits
   to the effectiveness of institutions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {A meta-analysis of SES framework case studies: Identifying dyad and
   triad archetypes},
Journal = {PEOPLE AND NATURE},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 MAR 28},
Abstract = {<ol><li>There is a need to synthesize the vast amount of empirical case
   study research on social-ecological systems (SES) to advance theory.
   Innovative methods are needed to identify patterns of system
   interactions and outcomes at different levels of abstraction. Many
   identifiable patterns may only be relevant to small sets of cases, a
   sector or regional context, and some more broadly. Theory needs to match
   these levels while still retaining enough details to inform
   context-specific governance. Archetype analysis offers concepts and
   methods for synthesizing and explaining patterns of interactions across
   cases. At the most basic level, there is a need to identify two and
   three independent variable groupings (i.e. dyads and triads) as a
   starting point for archetype identification (i.e. as theoretical
   building blocks). The causal explanations of dyads and triads are easier
   to understand than larger models, and once identified, can be used as
   building blocks to construct or explain larger theoretical models. We
   analyse the recurrence of independent variable interactions across 71
   quantitative SES models generated from qualitative case study research
   applying Ostrom's SES framework and examine their relationships to
   specific outcomes (positive or negative, social or ecological). We use
   hierarchical clustering, principal component analysis and network
   analysis tools to identify the frequency and recurrence of dyads and
   triads across models of different sizes and outcome groups.</li><li>We
   also measure the novelty of model composition as models get larger. We
   support our quantitative model findings with illustrative visual and
   narrative examples in four case study boxes covering deforestation in
   Indonesia, pollution in the Rhine River, fisheries management in Chile
   and renewable wind energy management in Belgium.</li><li>Findings
   indicate which pairs of two (dyads) and three (triads) variables are
   most frequently linked to either positive or negative, social or
   ecological outcomes. We show which pairs account for most of the
   variation of interactions across all the models (i.e. the optimal
   suite). Both the most frequent and optimal suite sets are good starting
   points for assessing how dyads and triads can fulfil the role of
   explanatory archetype candidates. We further discuss challenges and
   opportunities for future SES modelling and synthesis research using
   archetype analysis.</li> </ol>},

Journal = {PLOS ONE},

Abstract = {Cooperation is thought to be a necessary condition to solve collective
   action dilemmas such as climate change or the sustainable use of common
   pool resources. Yet, it is poorly understood how situations pervaded by
   thresholds shape the behaviour of people facing collective dilemmas.
   Here we provide empirical evidence that resource users facing thresholds
   maintain on average cooperative behaviours in the sense of maximising
   their individual earnings while ensuring future group opportunities. A
   framed field experiment in the form of a dynamic game with 256 Colombian
   fishers helped us investigate individual behavioural responses to the
   existence of thresholds, risk and uncertainty. Thresholds made fishers
   extract less fish compared to situation without thresholds, but risk had
   a stronger effect on reducing individual fishing effort. Contrary to
   previous expectations, cooperation did not break down. If cooperation
   can be maintained in the face of thresholds, then communicating
   uncertainty is more policy-relevant than estimating precisely where
   tipping points lay in social-ecological systems.},

Title = {Interplay of multiple goods, ecosystem services, and property rights in
   large social-ecological marine protected areas},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {20},
Number = {4},
Abstract = {Protected areas are a cornerstone of biodiversity conservation, and
   increasingly, conservation science is integrating ecological and social
   considerations in park management. Indeed, both social and ecological
   factors need to be considered to understand processes that lead to
   changes in environmental conditions. Here, we use a social-ecological
   systems lens to examine changes in governance through time in an
   extensive regional protected area network, the Great Barrier Reef Marine
   Park. We studied the peer-reviewed and nonpeer-reviewed literature to
   develop an understanding of governance of the Great Barrier Reef Marine
   Park and its management changes through time. In particular, we examined
   how interacting and changing property rights, as designated by the
   evolving marine protected area network and other institutional changes
   (e.g., fisheries management), defined multiple goods and ecosystem
   services and altered who could benefit from them. The rezoning of the
   Great Barrier Reef Marine Park in 2004 substantially altered the types
   and distribution of property rights and associated benefits from
   ecosystem goods and services. Initially, common-pool resources were
   enjoyed as common and private benefits at the expense of public goods
   (overexploited fisheries and reduced biodiversity and ecosystem health).
   The rezoning redefined the available goods and benefits and who could
   benefit, prioritizing public goods and benefits (i.e., biodiversity
   conservation), and inducing private costs (through reduced fishing). We
   also found that the original conceptualization of the step-wise
   progression of property rights from user to owner oversimplifies
   property rights based on its division into operational and
   collective-choice rule-making levels. Instead, we suggest that a
   diversity of available management tools implemented simultaneously can
   result in interactions that are seldom fully captured by the original
   conceptualization of the bundling of property rights. Understanding the
   complexities associated with overlapping property rights and multiple
   goods and ecosystem services, particularly within large-scale systems,
   can help elucidate the source and nature of some of the governance
   challenges that large protected areas are facing.},

Title = {Territories of life as key to global environmental sustainability},
Journal = {CURRENT OPINION IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {63},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Territories and areas that Indigenous peoples and local communities
   govern, manage, and conserve (hereafter territories of life) are
   increasingly recognized by scientists, international agencies,
   nongovernmental, and grassroot organizations, as central to the future
   of a healthy and sustainable planet. Hundreds of thousands of such
   social-ecological systems exist worldwide, covering millions of square
   kilometers of land and seascapes on all five continents, contributing to
   the conservation and sustainable use of a significant proportion of the
   world's biodiversity. Nevertheless, these systems are facing many
   threats and often have little-to-no formal recognition or support from
   nation-state governments. In order to address this growing need, this
   review provides the most complete, recent, and updated global overview
   of territories of life. The review advocates for a holistic approach of
   territories of life and identifies key opportunities for researchers to
   favor action-and policy-oriented research in support of such vital
   systems for global sustainability.},

Title = {Using Private Rights to Manage Natural Resources: Is Stewardship Linked
   to Ownership?},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {17},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {There is increasing interest in privatizing natural resource systems to
   promote sustainability and conservation goals. Though economic theory
   suggests owners of private property rights have an incentive to act as
   resource stewards, few studies have tested this empirically. This paper
   asks whether private rights-owners were more conservative with respect
   to their management opinions than nonrights-owners in five Australian
   abalone (Haliotis spp.) fisheries. Multiple regression analyses were
   used to link opinions to demographic, economic, and attitudinal
   variables. In contrast to standard economic assumptions,
   nonrights-owners suggested more conservative catch limits than did
   rights-owners, confirming qualitative observations of behavior in
   management workshops. Differing views about the condition of the
   resource and differing levels of experience contributed to these
   results. The first of its kind, this study directly demonstrates that
   private rights do not necessarily promote the greatest level of
   stewardship. This has substantial implications for how natural resources
   are governed globally, but also warns against applying simplistic
   behavioral assumptions to complex social-ecological systems.},

Title = {The New Institutional Economics and the Economics of Natural Resources:

Journal = {ECONOMIA AGRARIA Y RECURSOS NATURALES},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {10},
Number = {2},
Pages = {61-91},
Abstract = {In recent decades, the New Institutional Economics has brought about the
   ``return of institutions{''} to the economic mainstream, and
   institutional theory and analysis have been developed from Ronald
   Coase's notion of transaction costs and Douglass North's view on
   institutions. The Nobel Prize award in Economics to Oliver Williamson
   and Elinor Ostrom in 2009 has pointed out the relevance of the new
   institutional approach. Natural Resource Economics has included the
   institutional determinants of the management of natural resources into
   its research agenda. In this sense, the advances of the New
   Institutional Economics allows the development of institutional analysis
   in the field of the Economics of Natural Resources, such as Elinor
   Ostrom's work has shown. This paper presents an integral and updated
   perspective of the foundations of the New Institutional Economics that
   constitute a set of theoretical inputs for the analysis of institutions
   and governance in the management of natural resources.},

Title = {Breaking the elected rules in a field experiment on forestry resources},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {90},
Pages = {132-139},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Harvesting from common resources has been studied through experimental
   work in the laboratory and in the field. In this paper we report on a
   dynamic commons experiment, representing a forest, performed with
   different types of communities of resource users in Thailand and
   Colombia, as well as student participants. We find that all groups
   overharvest the resource in the first part of the experiment and that
   there is no statistical difference between the various types of groups.
   In the second part of the experiment, participants appropriate the
   common resource after one of three possible regulations is elected and
   implemented. There is less overharvesting after the rules are
   implemented, but there is a significant amount of rule breaking. The
   surprising finding is that Colombian villagers break the rules of the
   games more often than other groups, and even more so when they have more
   trust in members of the community. This observation can be explained by
   the distrust in externally proposed regulations due to the institutional
   and cultural context. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {The Future of Tourism in the Anthropocene},
Journal = {ANNUAL REVIEW OF ENVIRONMENT AND RESOURCES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {47},
Pages = {423-447},
Abstract = {This article undertakes a comprehensive review of tourism's impacts on
   social-ecological systems and the use of the local to global commons. It
   examines a wide range of issues from climate change and air travel to
   biodiversity loss, pollution, and overtourism. It reinforces that
   tourism in modernity has pursued a dominant growth-driven paradigm of
   development and market expansion that is unsustainable. The review
   raises critical questions about how to move forward in the Anthropocene,
   where climate change is an existential threat to which travel and
   tourism must adjust. We offer directions for knowledge creation to
   develop nature-positive tourism that decouples from greenhouse gas
   emissions and seeks the regeneration of natural capital and communal
   health and well-being. This direction includes rethinking the purposes
   and values of tourism by addressing equity and ethical issues. It also
   calls for inclusivity of diverse worldviews and knowledge systems,
   including traditional and Indigenous knowledge. Such a pluralistic
   paradigm replaces the unsustainable modernist tourism paradigm that has
   dominated its evolution. We conclude with suggestions for research to
   advance nature-positive tourism.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {45},

Abstract = {This article examines recent research on approaches to community-based
   environmental and natural resource management and reviews the
   commonalities and differences between these interdisciplinary and
   multistakeholder initiatives. To identify the most effective
   characteristics of Community-based natural resource management (CBNRM),
   I collected a multiplicity of perspectives from research teams and then
   grouped findings into a matrix of organizational principles and key
   characteristics. The matrix was initially vetted (or ``field tested{''})
   by applying numerous case studies that were previously submitted to the
   World Bank International Workshop on CBNRM. These practitioner case
   studies were then compared and contrasted with the findings of the
   research teams. It is hoped that the developed matrix may be useful to
   researchers in further focusing research, understanding core
   characteristics of effective and sustainable CBNRM, providing
   practitioners with a framework for developing new CBNRM initiatives for
   managing the commons, and providing a potential resource for academic
   institutions during their evaluation of their practitioner-focused
   environmental management and leadership curriculum.},

Title = {Resilience through adaptation},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {12},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB 14},
Abstract = {Adaptation of agents through learning or evolution is an important
   component of the resilience of Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS). Without
   adaptation, the flexibility of such systems to cope with outside
   pressures would be much lower. To study the capabilities of CAS to
   adapt, social simulations with agent-based models (ABMs) provide a
   helpful tool. However, the value of ABMs for studying adaptation depends
   on the availability of methodologies for sensitivity analysis that can
   quantify resilience and adaptation in ABMs. In this paper we propose a
   sensitivity analysis methodology that is based on comparing
   time-dependent probability density functions of output of ABMs with and
   without agent adaptation. The differences between the probability
   density functions are quantified by the socalled earth-mover's distance.
   We use this sensitivity analysis methodology to quantify the probability
   of occurrence of critical transitions and other long-term effects of
   agent adaptation. To test the potential of this new approach, it is used
   to analyse the resilience of an ABM of adaptive agents competing for a
   common-pool resource. Adaptation is shown to contribute positively to
   the resilience of this ABM. If adaptation proceeds sufficiently fast, it
   may delay or avert the collapse of this system.},

Abstract = {Environmental history, as a field of analysis and transdisciplinary
   study, aims to explore the interactions between society and ecosystems
   from a deep understanding of how relationships between human groups and
   natural systems change over defined periods of time. This article seeks
   to delve into the environmental history of the savannahs of the Cesar
   department in Colombia, documenting the milestones in the privatization
   of the commons and the degradation of social-ecological systems.
   Methodologically, satellite images and aerial photographs are analyzed
   to determine the changes in land cover that reveal the state of the
   ecosystems, and an ethnographic approach is used to document the
   perception and valuation of local Afro-descendant communities in the
   region. The article shows how, over the last 60 years, land-use planning
   models have favored individual appropriation practices and
   agroindustrial models over collective forms of pastoralism and
   small-scale agrifood systems. It also documents the main
   socio-ecological impacts and the conflicts implicit in different tenure
   models that should be taken into account in the various public policies
   related to sustainability, peace building, and the recognition of
   territorial rights in the Colombian Caribbean.},

Abstract = {Human actions are transforming ecosystems across the globe. Six
   frameworks aid in understanding the forces that drive human stress on
   the environment and human responses to this stress. Two of them, the
   stochastic impacts by regression on population, affluence and technology
   (STIRPAT) model and decomposition analysis, are approaches to analyzing
   data. Four describe the interrelated system of human actions and
   environmental responses: driving forces, pressures, states, impacts,
   responses (DPSIR); the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA) framework;
   coupled human and natural systems (CHANS) and telecoupling; and
   social-ecological systems (SES). In applying these frameworks, attention
   must be given to the scale of analysis and to the effects of context. In
   addition to the frameworks there are four substantial research
   literatures providing theory and empirical analysis of how drivers place
   stress on the environment: a macrocomparative tradition, work on
   household energy consumption, land change science, and research on
   commons. Although these traditions remain somewhat separate, they are
   largely complementary.},

Organization = {Florida State Univ},
Abstract = {Critical understanding of territorial use rights in fisheries (TURFs)
   are examined through the lens of research on the fishing cooperatives of
   the northern Pacific coast of Mexico. I contend that the argument for
   TURFs is problematic in implying that closing access, excluding others
   from a territory or resources, provides the basis for adopting measures
   that lead to sustained use and stewardship, or conservation. The success
   that the fishing cooperatives of the area have achieved in co-managing
   their lobster fisheries is indeed due in part to the concession system
   that allocates exclusive territorial use rights to individual
   cooperatives. But that is only one part of a complex bundle of
   institutional and resource features of the TURFs that contribute to
   their success. Further analysis shows that the concession fisheries fit
   well-known criteria for successful small-scale ``commons{''} management.
   However, the risk of oversimplification remains. The functioning and
   achievements of the cooperatives are also very specific to local
   histories, ecologies, and the larger socio-political environment, which
   calls for greater depth and interdisciplinarity in analysis and
   application.},

Abstract = {This article highlights how fieldwork scholars of adaptation in
   resource-dependent communities may enhance our capacity to craft
   comparative lessons and contribute an empirical foundation to theories
   and policy initiatives for adaptation. We briefly synthesize how
   scholars conducting field research on adaptation in common pool resource
   communities have measured and assessed adaptation, discuss some of the
   points of contention in the adaptation literature and in the field, and
   indicate ways in which adaptation could be further clarified in the
   field. Specifically, we identify a need for greater clarity in how field
   researchers define adaptation, examine the relationship between
   disturbance and adaptive response, and evaluate the outcomes of
   adaptation processes. Our review of the literature reiterates the
   challenges in comparing case studies and suggests means by which greater
   conceptual and methodological clarity may provide a much-needed
   empirical foundation to our understanding of adaptation processes.},

Title = {Averting Evolutionary Suicide from the Tragedy of the Commons},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE COMMONS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {15},
Number = {1},
Pages = {414-430},
Abstract = {In a tragedy of the commons, individual competition over a resource can
   reduce the resource itself, and thus reduce the fitness of the whole
   group. An extreme example is evolutionary suicide, which is predicted to
   occur when the selfish interests of free-riders and cheaters overwhelm
   cooperative behaviors, and the social good on which they depend ceases
   to exist. Case studies cite many different and seemingly interacting
   factors for success. Here we propose an equation-based theoretical model
   to predict changes in this balance, which determine whether the tragedy
   of the commons is observed in a particular scenario. Using survey data
   from 20 Balinese subaks, we explore the explanatory power of two
   theoretical traditions that are currently used to analyze commons
   management institutions, revealing multiple regimes with correlated
   responses to environmental threats. To explore case studies from a
   comparative perspective requires both theory and methods that can
   account for differences between regimes and explore transitions between
   them.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {2},
Pages = {86-100},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {How current coping capacity could be transformed into longer term
   adaptive capacity is a crucial question for those involved in adaptation
   planning, especially to enhance sustainability. To shed light on this
   question, this manuscript will review how coping capacity and adaptive
   capacity have been conceptualised in resilience and vulnerability
   approaches to climate change adaptation. The four key challenges to
   understand the transformation of coping to adaptive capacity include (1)
   the concealed nature of adaptive capacity; (2) the temporal trade-offs
   between coping and adaptive capacity; (3) the limited focus to date on
   rural communities, and; (4) the lack of empirical evidence. The
   manuscript suggests that institutions play a key role in mediating the
   transformation of coping capacity into adaptive capacity and that its
   role can be best researched by combining vulnerability and resilience
   approaches to climate change adaptation. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Seeing the ocean through the eyes of seabirds could help meet the
   challenges of managing common-pool marine resources both in protected
   and unprotected areas. First, seabirds are top-predators, exposed to all
   threats affecting the oceans, and this makes them ideal sentinel
   organisms for monitoring changes within marine ecosystems. Second,
   seabirds cross both ecological and political boundaries, and following
   their movements should help making interdependencies within and between
   marine ecosystems more visible. Third, seabirds are conspicuous and
   often charismatic animals, which interact differently with different
   groups of stakeholders and provide the opportunity to acknowledge and
   discuss each other's values and interests. In this paper, we present
   these research avenues using a seabirds' view, for tackling marine
   conservation and management issues, and we give operational examples of
   implementation based on our work in the English Channel. (C) 2016

Abstract = {Ecosystems around the world generate a wide range of services. Often,
   there are trade-offs in ecosystem service provision. Managing such
   trade-offs requires governance of interdependent action situations. We
   distinguished between (1) enhancing action situations where
   beneficiaries create, maintain, or improve an ESS and (2) appropriation
   action situations where actors subtract from a flow of ESS. We
   classified ESSs in order to identify focal action situations and link
   them to ESS governance types which are likely to strengthen sustainable
   ecosystem management. The classification is applied to six forest cases
   in Asia, Africa and Latin America.
   Our results confirm that ecosystem management, which more strongly
   supports the provision of public goods and common pool resources, is
   often under strong pressure to be transformed into systems that mainly
   provide private goods. This can be partly explained by incentive
   constellations in the action situations of public goods and common pool
   resources. Therefore, governance has to be adapted to specific ESSs. ESS
   governance needs to identify institutions which best fit to different
   ESSs and to harmonize them for all the ESSs provided by the system. Our
   approach helps to understand why institutions fail or succeed in
   maintaining ESSs.},

Title = {Shades of Conflict in Kyrgyzstan: National Actor Perceptions and
   Behaviour in Mining},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE COMMONS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {14},
Number = {1},
Pages = {191-207},
Abstract = {Confronted with advancing resource frontiers, local communities
   increasingly rely on conflict to re-establish order in the face of
   problematic interdependences brought about by mining transactions. This
   article captures the interactions at national level that engender these
   interdependences in the first place. We explore how national actor
   groups influence emerging regularities of behaviour in mining through
   the example of gold mining in Kyrgyzstan - a fragile resource-dependent
   country divided by mining conflicts. For the analysis of these emerging
   patterns of behaviour, we focus on shared beliefs and norms that in
   interaction with perceived dimensions of transactions provide motivation
   to act. The identified regularities of behaviour help differentiate the
   otherwise crude dichotomy of conflict and cooperation, pointing to
   shades of conflicts. Mining conflicts in Kyrgyzstan are driven by
   profound structural factors that are rooted in weak governance, lack of
   institutional trust and limited cooperation across national actor
   groups. Risks and costs are distributed to outgroups, threatening the
   local social-ecological systems and further fragmenting Kyrgyz society.
   If extraction continues in the current mode of governance,
   resource-based grievances are likely to persist in Kyrgyzstan, as mining
   will increasingly encroach on local ecosystems, livelihoods and cultural
   commons - unless the national perceptions and shared beliefs change.},

Title = {Suspicious Collaborators: How Governments in Polycentric Systems Monitor
   Behavior and Enforce Public Good Provision Rules Against One Another},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE COMMONS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {13},
Number = {2},
Pages = {977-992},
Abstract = {Monitoring and enforcement have been recognized as keys for sustainable
   common pool resource governance. With a couple of notable exceptions,
   however, scholars have not examined how they are deployed when
   governments are the primary actors devising such agreements and where
   multiple public goods are provided for - an important level of
   governance to understand. We explore the design of monitoring and
   enforcement safeguards that governments adopt to limit opportunism and
   support compliance in a complex governing arrangement, the New York City
   Watersheds Memorandum of Agreement. The agreement defines how New York
   City and a group of watershed jurisdictions jointly manage a shared
   natural resource. Furthermore, we test how the design of such safeguards
   vary depending on the type of public good they cover, illuminating how
   ``federal{''} safeguards may work at the sub-state level, and,
   ultimately, the particular form of polycentric governance being used.
   The results indicate that concerns for water quality as well as
   potential for opportunistic behavior drive institutional design
   considerations. Monitoring and sanctioning authority for water quality
   is dominated by state and federal actors, which hold New York City to
   account, while watershed jurisdictions are held responsible by regional
   actors for administration of economic development goods.},

Journal = {SOCIETY \& NATURAL RESOURCES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {30},
Number = {9},
Pages = {1096-1111},
Abstract = {Locally managed marine areas (LMMAs) are often recommended as a strategy
   to achieve conservation and fisheries management, though few studies
   have evaluated their performance against these objectives. We assessed
   the effectiveness of eight periodically harvested closures (PHCs), the
   most common form of management within Fijian LMMAs, focusing on two
   outcomes: protection of resource units and biodiversity conservation. Of
   the eight PHCs, only one provided biodiversity benefits, whereas three
   were moderately successful in protecting resource units (targeted fish
   biomass). Protection of resource units was more likely when PHCs were
   harvested less frequently, less recently, and when total fish biomass in
   open areas was lower. Our findings further suggest that monitoring,
   enforcement, and clearly defined boundaries are critical, less frequent
   harvesting regimes are advised, and culturally appropriate management
   incentives are needed. Although PHCs have some potential to protect
   resource units, they are not recommended as a single strategy for
   broad-scale biodiversity conservation.},

Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {90},
Pages = {1-5},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Conventional common property thinking assumes that a central goal of
   management is to maintain social ecological systems in a healthy and
   resilient state, including maintaining the ability of communities to
   harvest across time and generations. Little research has been done,
   however, on how common property systems are affected by demographic
   shifts, the social status of emerging livelihoods, and the employment
   aspirations of users for their offspring. An empirical case study from
   Chile (well known for its common property fisheries) suggests that major
   socio-cultural shifts are now occurring, with a lack of entry by new
   fishers and an aging population of existing ones. These types of social
   and cultural changes are increasingly common through globalization and
   worldwide economic development, and pose significant policy challenges
   across broad classes of common property systems. The Chilean case
   reveals that community adaptive capacity can come at the expense of
   social-ecological common property systems, and highlights the need to
   consider the broader context of `slow' social variables.},

Abstract = {The article addresses the governance of water commons with an emphasis
   on drinking water. The study applied two conceptual frameworks: Ostrom's
   Design Principles and the Social-Ecological Systems framework. The
   empirical part refers to two water commons in Slovenia and is based on
   qualitative data from semi-structured interviews with locals and
   professionals. The article follows three objectives: 1) to identify the
   drivers and motivations for successful local water governance; 2) to
   assess the robustness of water commons in terms of current and future
   challenges; 3) to identify the benefits of water commons. The key
   elements for the functioning of the two local communities under
   examination are shared interests, as well as a strong commitment to
   effective management. In addition to the material benefits (i.e.
   drinking water supply), non-material ones are also important. Community
   building and identity are particularly noteworthy. The importance of
   small drinking water supply systems that are well organised and
   responsibly governed as commons is beneficial not only to a municipality
   but also to a country.},

Abstract = {Institutional arrangements are considered necessary for successfully
   governing the commons. They are considered to be most effective if they
   are self-organized rather than imposed from outside. However, endogenous
   institutional arrangements, such as local norms, are specific to a
   particular socio-ecological system (SES). This paper presents a SES
   model of communal livestock producers in South Africa. Its biophysical
   component accounts for the impact of biotic and abiotic factors on
   livestock population. The social agent-based component models individual
   and socially determined behaviour, the latter of which is a social norm
   specific to the case. Model results show that when cooperative agents
   obey and sanction the norm, there is less likelihood of SES collapse in
   terms of livestock population crashes. However, cooperation among agents
   only emerges in times of ecological crisis where social reorganization
   is fostered. The crisis creates an opportunity for initializing a
   self-enforcing process of mutual cooperation. Model specifications are
   based on survey data, and agents were parameterized according to
   individual household data. A sensitivity analysis shows that this
   empirical heterogeneity cannot be reduced without changing model
   outcomes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Common pool groundwater resources may be susceptible to overexploitation

   explore the potential for successful collective action ex -ante. We
   conduct an ex -ante assessment of the potential for collective action by
   users of a groundwater body, to identify whether necessary conditions
   are in place, using a mixed methods approach based on literature, expert
   consultation, and Q methodology. While some aspects were conducive to
   collective action, under current conditions it appears unlikely that
   users will self -organize. Four user sub -groups were identified,
   differing in terms of resource perceptions and prosocial behavior, with
   potential for tapping into the skills of potential leaders and
   capitalizing on the prosocial intent of team players, while building
   bridges for cooperation with sceptics and non -users. Such ex -ante
   assessment can serve to identify which conditions need to be cultivated
   to foster cooperation and to identify strategies for engaging with
   different user sub -groups.},

Abstract = {The management of communal pastures and wells has become a standard
   topic of research on pastoral societies and on the theory of common pool
   resource management. The paper sets our to disCUSS the history of
   scientific engagement with pastoral land tenure: after a focus on
   overstocking and degradation caused by irrational accumulating
   behaviour, the ``tragedy of the commons{''} became an important and
   politically influential narrative paving the way for the dismantling of
   pastoral commons. In recent years non-equilibrium qualities of savannah
   environments and well adapted local knowledge on the grazing vegetation
   were highlighted. The paper then sketches the management of common pool
   resources by the pastoral Pokor of north-western Kenya over a century.
   It is argued that institutions of common pool resource management
   changed profoundly according to specific political and ecological
   ramifications. Such changes astonishingly have not been the result Of
   incremental change but have been rather abrupt. Major perturbations of
   the social-ecological system (violence, drought) Contributed to Sudden

Abstract = {Aquaculture, and shrimp aquaculture in particular, can have major social
   and environmental impacts. However, aquaculture remains an understudied
   area in commons research. Can aspects of commons theory be applied to
   solve problems of aquaculture? We examined three coastal community-based
   shrimp aquaculture operations in northwestern Sri Lanka using a case
   study approach. These shrimp farms were individually owned by small
   producers and managed under local-level rules designed by cooperatives
   (samithi). The common-pool resource of major interest was water for
   aquaculture ponds, obtained from an interconnected water body. We
   evaluated the shrimp farming social-ecological system by using Ostrom's
   design principles for collective action. Key elements of the system
   were: clearly defined boundaries; collaboratively designed crop
   calendar, bottom-up approach involving community associations,
   multi-level governance, and farmers-and-government collaborative
   structures. Together, these elements resolved the excludability and
   subtractability problems of commons by establishing boundary and
   membership rules and collective choice rules.},

Abstract = {Protected areas are managed for multiple, often competing, goals
   including biodiversity conservation, community livelihoods, and tourism.
   However, there is a lack of clear evidence on which governance
   approaches are more effective in governing protected areas to achieve
   these goals. This paper sheds light on the effectiveness of different
   protected area governance approaches using Ostrom's Institutional
   Analysis and Development (IAD) framework. The research was conducted in
   three protected areas of Nepal: Chitwan National Park, the Annapurna
   Conservation Area, and the Kanchenjunga Conservation Area, which
   represent state-community, NGO, and community-managed protected areas,
   respectively. Data were collected through interviews, supplemented by
   published and unpublished documents, and field observations. Results
   revealed that the outcomes vary across the protected areas primarily
   because of their governance approaches and local contexts. Due to rigid
   monocentric and simple polycentric approaches, the PAs failed to adapt
   to the changing social-ecological systems. Based on the findings, a
   multi-layered polycentric adaptive co-management approach has been
   proposed. The study also developed a multi-goal IAD model to assess PA
   governance. Additional theoretical, methodological, and managerial
   implications with respect to protected areas governance are also
   discussed.},

Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {160},
Pages = {215-226},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The rapid rise in inequality is often seen to go in-hand with resource
   overuse. Examples include water extraction in Pakistan, land degradation
   in Bangladesh, forest harvesting in Sub-Saharan Africa and industrial
   fishing in Lake Victoria. While access to ecosystem services provided by
   common pool resources mitigates poverty, exclusive access to technology
   by wealthy individuals may fuel excessive resource extraction and
   deplete the resource, thus widening the wealth gap. We use a stylised
   social-ecological model, to illustrate how a positive feedback between
   wealth and technology may fuel local inequality. The resulting rise in
   local inequality can lead to resource degradation and critical
   transitions such as ecological resource collapse and unexpected increase
   in poverty. Further, we find that societies may evolve towards a stable
   state of few wealthy and many poor individuals, where the distribution
   of wealth depends on how access to technology is distributed. Overall,
   our results illustrate how access to technology may be a mechanism that
   fuels resource degradation and consequently pushes most vulnerable
   members of society into a poverty trap.},

Journal = {LAND USE POLICY},
Year = {2020},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The governance of the commons depends on collective action by resource
   users, which may be influenced by land use dynamics and changes in
   livelihood. We examine the case of China that has experienced massive
   outmigration of its rural population and significant changes to its land
   use policy. We contribute to the literature by examining the interaction
   effects of farmland use rights trading and rural labor out migration on
   collective action for the governance of the irrigation commons, which
   has the potential to open up a new line of theoretical and empirical
   inquiry. Using the socio-ecological system framework, we run ordered
   probit regression based on data from a survey of 125 villages in 18
   provinces in China. We find that a moderate degree of farmland use
   rights trading has a positive effect on collective action for the
   governance of the irrigation commons and can slow down and mitigate the
   negative effect of rural labor outmigration. We conclude with
   implications for land use policy and governance of the commons.},

   the Seri Callo de Hacha Fishery in Mexico},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {13},
Number = {2},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {My goal was to describe how biological and ecological factors give shape
   to fishing practices that can contribute to the successful
   self-governance of a small-scale fishing system in the Gulf of
   California, Mexico. The analysis was based on a comparison of the main
   ecological and biological indicators that fishers claim to use to govern
   their day-to-day decision making about fishing and data collected in
   situ. I found that certain indicators allow fishers to learn about
   differences and characteristics of the resource system and its units.
   Fishers use such information to guide their day-to-day fishing
   decisions. More importantly, these decisions appear unable to shape the
   reproductive viability of the fishery because no indicators were
   correlated to the reproductive cycle of the target species. As a result,
   the fishing practices constitute a number of mechanisms that might
   provide short-term buffering capacity against perturbations or stress
   factors that otherwise would threaten the overall sustainability and
   self-governance of the system. The particular biological circumstances
   that shape the harvesting practices might also act as a precursor of
   self-governance because they provide fishers with enough incentives to
   meet the costs of organizing the necessary rule structure that underlies
   a successful self-governance system.},

Title = {Cross-scale interactions of socio-hydrological subsystems: examining the
   frontier of common pool resource governance in Arizona},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {14},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {A critical frontier of water management in the western US is the
   challenge of cross-scale interactions. It is difficult to establish
   clear governance boundaries and collectively act when basins are
   interconnected, surface water and groundwater flows are interrelated,
   and urban and rural water demands are increasingly affected by regional
   and international telecoupling. Changing climate, snowpack, and
   rainfall, peri-urbanization, and shifting economics of rural landscapes
   further increase sustainable governance challenges. Using a lens of
   cross-scale interactions drawn from the social-ecological literature, we
   develop a set of conceptual frames for socio-hydrology that highlight:
   (1) spatial and temporal mismatches, (2) telecoupled flows, and (3)
   networked and nested systems. Using the exemplary case of Central
   Arizona, we explore nesting of the system within the larger western
   socio-hydrological system(SHS), impacts of changing Colorado River
   policies, such as the Drought Contingency Plan, and emerging
   institutional arrangements between the State of Arizona, agricultural
   communities, and Tribal Nations. We conclude with a set of questions
   that inform analyses of cross-scale, multi-level governance within
   social-ecological systems. Without grappling with the dynamics and
   interconnectedness of SHSs, we cannot sustainably manage water in an
   increasingly arid West.},

Title = {Perceptions of governance effectiveness and fisheries restriction
   options in a climate refugia},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {246},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Common-pool resources are challenged by a number of factors including
   broadly acceptable resource extraction restrictions and effective
   implementation of proposed restrictions. Consequently, we evaluated
   fisher's perceptions of effectiveness of their governance institutions
   and benefits of restrictions in 16 East African marine fishing
   communities. M this site level the mean perceived effectiveness of 10
   governance institutions and benefits of six restrictions were positively
   related (r(2) = 0.57, p < 0.0007). However, this relationship masked
   governance-restriction dimensions that differentiated communities that
   perceive benefits of closures, protected areas, and species selection
   versus those preferring gear, minimum sizes of fish at capture, and
   closed season restrictions. The first ``pro-conservation group{''} was
   distinguished by their higher scaling of the effectiveness of monitoring
   of resources and users, graduated sanctions, group identity, and
   decision-making. Consequently, stronger support for traditional area-and
   species-based conservation may require strengthening these institutions
   whereas traditional fisheries restrictions should find more support
   where these institutions are weaker. A climate refugia center that was a
   high priority for spatial management had strong support for closure
   restrictions in some sites but weak effectiveness of monitoring of
   resource users and ecology more broadly, which will need to be
   strengthened to insure successful area-based management.},

Title = {Investing in the commons: transient welfare creates incentives despite
   open access},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {26},
Number = {2},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Local users may invest in managing common pool resources, thereby
   promoting social and ecological resilience. Institutional or economic
   limits on access are regarded as essential preconditions for
   incentivizing local investments, but we show that investment incentives
   can exist even under open access. We modeled a recreational harvest
   fishery in which local or centralized managers invest in fish stocking
   to maximize social welfare. Although classic open access dissipation of
   rents occurs at equilibrium, the sluggish response of fishing effort to
   changing conditions allows welfare to accrue in transition to
   equilibrium. This transient welfare creates persistent incentives to
   invest. Empirical observations showed that stocking by local collective
   action groups occurred at rates similar to model-predicted optima, while
   centralized stocking occurred at rates greater than predicted optima.
   Our results emphasize the potential benefits of local involvement in
   managing the commons, even under conditions that were previously thought
   to preclude effective collective action.},

   Genebanks in the Network of Crop Diversity Actors},
Journal = {AGRONOMY-BASEL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This paper rethinks the governance of genebanks in a social and
   political context that has significantly evolved since their
   establishment. The theoretical basis for the paper is the commons
   conceptual framework in relation to both seed and plant genetic
   resources. This framework is applied to question the current policy
   ecosystem of genetic research and breeding and explore different
   collective governance models. The concept of crop diversity management
   system (CDMS) commons is proposed as the new foundation for a more
   holistic and inclusive framework for crop diversity management, that
   covers a broad range of concerns and requires different actors. The
   paper presents a multi-stakeholder process established within the
   context of the two recent projects CoEx and Dynaversity, imagining
   possible collective arrangements to overcome existing deadlocks, foster
   collective learning, and design collaborative relationships among
   genebanks, researchers, and farmers' civil society organizations
   involved in crop diversity management.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF PHYSICS COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2017},

Abstract = {The successful management of a common pool resource (CPR) by its social
   agents is key to its sustainability. In order to maintain the ecological
   resource of such a coupled socio-ecological system, cooperative effort
   from the whole society is required and this necessitates proper social
   control mechanism to regulate the social order. In this paper, we
   explore the effects of two social control mechanisms: ostracism and
   voluntary enforcement, on agents that actively exploit the CPR within
   societies of different social network structures (as encapsulated by its
   average network degree). By means of numerical simulations and
   analytical approximation, we made inference on the dynamical behavior of
   the system in terms of its phase diagram. The phase diagram is found to
   contain a plethora of phases and associated phase transitions as we
   enumerate them based on a social and an ecological parameter. At a large
   average network degree, the features of the phases are observed to be
   similar for the direct voluntary enforcement and indirect ostracism
   mechanisms. However, these features exhibit a unique difference at low
   average network degree, where we uncover a new phenomenon of
   non-equilibrium oscillatory phase attributed to the voluntary
   enforcement mechanism.},

Abstract = {Social-ecological resilience (SER) and sustainable commons management
   (SCM) are process- and outcome-based paradigms for natural resource
   management. Resource management plans foster them, but traditional plan
   quality assessment typically omits process dimensions. We examined what
   constitutes an appropriate plan quality evaluation framework for
   resource management plans that reflect these SER and SCM paradigms. In
   order to create a plan quality instrument for assessing embedded SER and
   SCM processes, we employed a two-part methodology of a meta-ethnographic
   analysis and then used the results to augment current advances in plan
   quality evaluation to assess adaptation efforts. While methodologically
   novel in the academic planning canon, the meta-ethnographic approach has
   been used to inductively synthesize qualitative studies' results in, for
   example, the fields of public health, medicine, and education. Our use
   advances plan quality evaluation with a new metric that combines the
   paradigmatic resource management strategies and addresses identified
   shortcomings in the more novel adaptive plan quality evaluation approach
   that builds on the former, traditional one.},

Title = {Institutional Performance of Collective Irrigation Systems: A Fuzzy Set
   Qualitative Comparative Analysis in the Nile Delta of Egypt},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Egypt, akin to many countries in the global South, has striven to
   promote collective management to overcome the challenges of irrigation
   management since the 1990s. Establishing shared pumping stations (SPSs)
   has been one of the cornerstones helping farmers better manage water for
   irrigation. Operating SPSs successfully poses collective action
   problems, for which there is no single set of solutions. This paper
   utilizes fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to identify
   which conditions or configurations are sufficient or necessary for
   well-operated SPSs. The study draws on empirical data gathered through
   semi-structured interviews from 45 cases, located in Kafr El-Sheikh
   Governorate in Egypt's Nile Delta. Results show that three different
   paths are sufficient to ensure well-operated SPSs. These are: (1) the
   condition of effective rules related to allocation, monitoring, and
   sanctions; (2) the configuration of small group size of SPSs and large
   irrigated sizes of SPSs; or (3) the configuration of adequate water
   supply and appropriate location of the SPS command area. The paper
   concludes that neither group size nor resource size alone explains the
   outcome of collective action, while a combination of both factors does.
   Similarly, an adequate water supply is essential to enhance users'
   engagement in collective actions only when resource location
   characteristics do not provide alternative water sources for irrigation.},

Volume = {44},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {Coexistence theory (CT) in community ecology provides a functional
   perspective on how multiple competing species coexist. Here, I explore
   CT's usefulness for understanding conflict and coexistence among human
   groups with diverse livelihood interests in shared resources such as
   fisheries. I add three concepts from social science research on
   coexistence: adaptability, pluralism, and equity and apply this expanded
   theoretical framework to the case of salmon fisheries in Alaska's Cook
   Inlet, synthesizing catch records with anthropological research. The
   analysis addresses issues of inequity, such as who bears the costs of
   conservation measures, a lack of pluralism, in that people have come to
   devalue their neighbors, and a decline in resilience for some sectors,
   all of which undermine the likelihood of these groups continuing
   coexistence. I discuss policy options for addressing escalating conflict
   in the region, such as improving equity in management and the resilience
   of some fishing groups to temporary closures. Finally, I discuss points
   of engagement for CT with other areas of sustainability science such as
   resilience thinking.},

   Namibia during a drought},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {124},
Pages = {62-71},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {In Namibia, rural water governance has changed profoundly during the
   last two decades. Today, in many rural communities, user associations
   administer water and set the rules for management practices. Their rules
   typically define boundaries and specify contributions that vary for
   members and outsiders. When the rains failed in 2012-14, the mobility of
   people and herds increased and put the newly formed institutional
   regimes to a critical test. Based on long-term ethnographic fieldwork in
   seven communities, we examine whether and how management regimes were
   either altered or applied. The results indicate that cultural models of
   kinship and reciprocity took priority over formal agreements during the
   drought. Non-adherence to formalized practices and to rules of excluding
   outsiders also expresses a certain resistance to the interpretation of
   water as an economic good. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {The sustainable use of common-pool resources depends on users' behaviour
   with regards to appropriation and provision. Most knowledge about
   behaviour in such situations comes from experimental research. As
   experiments take place in confined environments, motivational drivers
   and actions in the field might differ. This paper analyses farmers' use
   of common property pastures in Grindelwald, Switzerland. Binary logistic
   regression is applied to survey data to explore the effect of farmers'
   attributes on livestock endowment, appropriation and provision
   behaviour. Furthermore, Q methodology is used to assess the impact of
   broader contextual variables on the sustainability of common property
   pastures. It is shown that the strongest associations exist between (a)
   socio-economic attributes and change in livestock endowment; (b) norms
   and appropriation behaviour; and (c) area and pay-off and provision
   behaviour. Relevant contextual variables are the economic value of the
   resource units, off-farm income opportunities, and the subsidy
   structure. We conclude that with increasing farm size farmers reduce the
   use and maintenance of common property. Additionally, we postulate that
   readiness to maintain a resource increases with appropriation activities
   and the net returns generated from appropriation.},

Abstract = {Fruit fly area-wide management (FF AWM) programs are seen as a
   favourable option to control the pest. These undertakings are nested in
   direct and wider institutional contexts that determine many of the
   opportunities and limitations that apply to the local situation. In
   addition, locally, there is an interplay between the biophysical
   characteristics of the region, the social profile of groups contributing
   to fruit fly risk and the local management group. There is a need for
   local `rules of the game' to meet growers' FF control objectives, such
   as gaining and protecting access to lucrative markets, and to overcome
   social challenges. This paper presents the preliminary findings from two
   Australian case studies of AWM to control Queensland fruit fly. Findings
   are combined with some aspects of socio-ecological systems literature to
   better understand the social and institutional aspects of
   industry-driven FF AWM programs. These issues are overlooked in AWM
   related literature, which predominantly focuses on the biophysical and
   technical aspects of FF control. This paper explains the need to
   incorporate concepts such as adaptive management, the need for
   trade-offs to achieve robust programs and that these come at a cost that
   is easily overlooked in benefit cost analysis of FF AWM programs.},

Abstract = {The experience of watershed development and management in countries of
   the Global South highlights significant challenges to governance.
   Establishing the overlap between watershed and commons, this paper
   identifies some of the most critical challenges to watershed governance
   in India, which follow from the uneven power relations and politics
   among diverse watershed actors. Common issues are faced in the
   implementation of the adaptive, polycentric governance regimes that are
   recommended for governing complex social-ecological systems like
   watersheds. Popular approaches in the commons literature that are
   focused on institutional analysis, however, do not adequately engage
   with the power and politics in natural resource governance; indeed,
   power relations and politics around a watershed can be better analysed
   using a social constructionist approach to natural resource governance.
   As has been attempted in some recent commons scholarship, this should
   include perspectives from political ecology, feminist political ecology,
   and critical human geography. Such an approach can help explain the
   historical emergence of the watershed through multiple socially
   constructed processes. It can also facilitate investigation into the
   relationship between watershed governing institutions and the changing
   human subjectivities of watershed actors that underlie dynamic scalar
   commoning. This paper discusses the potential, challenges and
   limitations of a social constructionist approach to the comprehensive
   diagnosis of watersheds; it also highlights some key questions that can
   be addressed through future research.},

Volume = {283},
Number = {1822},
Month = {JAN 13},
Abstract = {Sustainable use of common-pool resources such as fish, water or forests
   depends on the cooperation of resource users that restrain their
   individual extraction to socially optimal levels. Empirical evidence has
   shown that under certain social and biophysical conditions,
   self-organized cooperation in the commons can evolve. Global change,
   however, may drastically alter these conditions. We assess the
   robustness of cooperation to environmental variability in a stylized
   model of a community that harvests a shared resource. Community members
   follow a norm of socially optimal resource extraction, which is enforced
   through social sanctioning. Our results indicate that both resource
   abundance and a small increase in resource variability can lead to
   collapse of cooperation observed in the no-variability case, while
   either scarcity or large variability have the potential to stabilize it.
   The combined effects of changes in amount and variability can reinforce
   or counteract each other depending on their size and the initial level
   of cooperation in the community. If two socially separate groups are
   ecologically connected through resource leakage, cooperation in one can
   destabilize the other. These findings provide insights into possible
   effects of global change and spatial connectivity, indicating that there
   is no simple answer as to their effects on cooperation and sustainable
   resource use.},

Abstract = {The success of protected areas as a management tool for biodiversity
   conservation remains as a challenge, and broader approaches for
   protected area management have been proposed. Considering biodiversity
   conservation as an issue of the commons and within the realm of
   social-ecological systems is a promising alternative. In Brazil
   protected areas are under a State management regime, ruled by the
   National System of Conservation Units. The Ecological Station of
   Guaraquecaba (ESG) is a no-take protected area located in the Paranagua
   Estuarine Complex, surrounded by traditional communities. In this
   article, Ostrom's design principles were adapted to assess the
   institutional dynamics of this protected area management, during two
   periods. Research methods included semi-structured interviews,
   participant observation and document analysis. During the first period,
   management actions were oriented to prevent the conversion of forest
   areas into anthropic occupations. The second period originated in 2000
   with the creation of the National System of Conservation Units, which
   established more precise management tools and mechanisms for
   participatory decision making. In both periods there was low fulfillment
   of Ostrom's principles. The main changes over time were the creation of
   the ESG management council as a conflict-resolution mechanism, and an
   increase in the recognition of the rights of local communities. Yet,
   only three of the eight principles are totally present in the current
   institutional arrangement (well-defined boundaries, conflict-resolution
   mechanisms, and minimal recognition of rights). The results suggest a
   not robust institutional arrangement in terms of commons sustainable
   management.},

Title = {Conflict resolution through ecosystem-based management: the case of
   Swedish moose management},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE COMMONS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {7},
Number = {2},
Pages = {549-570},
Abstract = {Swedish moose (Alces alces) management has over the years transformed
   from a situation similar to what Hardin (1968) defined as a tragedy of
   the commons - i.e. where open access and unrestricted demands lead to
   over-exploitation - into a situation characterized by an abundance of
   moose. While high numbers of moose are preferred by hunters, they damage
   forests through grazing, causing conflicts between hunters and forest
   owners. In an attempt to resolve these disputes, the Swedish government
   is introducing a new local ecosystem-based management system. This paper
   analyzes this shift from managing a single resource to the broader
   perspective of ecosystem management and discusses to what extent it will
   contribute to conflict resolution. The results suggest that some of the
   problems highlighted may be solved through the implementation of an
   ecosystem management system. However, several challenges remain to be
   tackled, such as how to establish robust partnerships between forest
   owners and hunters for managing moose on land with a fragmented property
   rights structure. This can lead to different and conflicting objectives
   and, consequently, difficulties in reaching collective action.},

Abstract = {Collective action is a community resource crucial to ensure the
   resilience of communities. However, maintaining cooperation over time is
   also a significant challenge. Arguing that a major, though neglected,
   precondition for community resilience is sustained cooperation, this
   paper analyses the conditions triggering collective action in collective
   housing communities. Particular attention is paid to micro-level
   pathways through which characteristics of the common courtyard and the
   related rules for its use play for the maintenance or decay of
   collective action. The contours of an integrated theory of sustained
   cooperation is sketched. Drawing on Goal Framing (GF) theory and Common
   Pool Resource (CPR) theory, it is argued that CPR management
   institutions can only be effective in a community in which a normative
   goal frame is salient. Empirical material is presented from a
   multi-method comparative case study of four low-income urban collective
   housing communities in Mexico City in 2010. This evidence corroborates
   both approaches: the two communities characterized by sustained
   collective action exhibit a salient normative frame in combination with
   all elements of CPR managing institutions, whereas the two communities
   with failed collective action do not meet these conditions. The results
   suggest that both mechanisms are necessary for sustained cooperation to
   occur.},

   Forums Break Up Echo Chambers?(sic)(sic)(sic)Palabras clave},
Journal = {POLICY STUDIES JOURNAL},

Volume = {49},

Abstract = {Overcoming common-pool resource dilemmas requires learning across
   different sectors of society. However, policy actors frequently entrench
   themselves in so-called echo chambers by preferring to rely on
   information from those whose policy beliefs resemble their own. Policy
   forums can reduce the limiting effects of echo chambers by encouraging
   actors with diverse knowledge bases to exchange information and learn
   from one another. This paper applies exponential random graph models to
   network data from the South African tree plantation policy domain to
   investigate how belief homophily, reputational influence, and forum
   co-participation shape information exchange behavior. Results show that
   echo chambers are important determinants of information exchange ties
   and that reputational influence is likely to ``deepen{''} the echo.
   Results also show that the more forums that a pair of actors
   co-participate in, the more likely they are to exchange information.
   This applies to information exchange generally, as well as information
   exchange with trusted partners. Findings indicate that forums enable
   both cognitive learning (as knowledge gains) and relational learning (as
   improved relations). Nonetheless, when echo chambers are strong, and
   many forums are polarized, then forum co-participation may not break up
   echo chambers.},

Abstract = {Agroecological landscapes, which promote critical features such as
   agrobiodiversity, represent valuable global commons. These landscapes
   are products of ways of life, local knowledge, and rural practices.
   Recent studies agree on the need to better understand such rooted
   social-ecological systems by more deeply exploring their
   human-environment relationships. To address this, we investigated
   agroecological landscapes in two communities, one in the Andean
   highlands of northwest Argentina, the other in the Dolomites in northern
   Italy. This research applies discourse-ethnographic methods to explore
   how the communities build institutions to protect their culture, how
   they manage change, and how the environment is perceived and used. Based
   on the results, we identified several dimensions of farmers' intangible
   values, their understanding of well-being, and how they contribute to
   the genesis of landscapes (maize terraces, alpine pastures). This work
   shows that many interviewees did not perceive nature merely as a
   resource or service for humans, as suggested by the widely held
   discourse of agricultural industrialization, and that alternative
   relationships to nature are possible and do exist in practice. Further,
   this work raises relevant issues for how to imagine the transition to
   agricultural systems that do not define well-being only from the
   perspective of materiality and of humans.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {51},
Number = {4},
Pages = {912-925},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Many common pool resources have traditionally been managed through
   intricate local governance arrangements. Over time, such arrangements
   are confronted with manifold political, social, economic and ecological
   changes. However, the ways in which local governance arrangements react
   to such changes are poorly understood. Using the theoretical concept of
   institutional adaptation, we analyse the history of Harenna forest,
   Ethiopia, to examine processes of institutional change over the last 150
   years. We find that the traditional institutions that governed Harenna's
   resources persisted, in essence, over time. However, these institutions
   were modified repeatedly to address changes caused by varying formal,
   supra-regional governance regimes, the development of markets for forest
   products, increasing population pressure and changes in formal property
   rights. A key mechanism for adaptation was combining elements from both
   informal and formal institutions, which allowed traditional rules to
   persist in the guise of more formal arrangements. Our findings also
   highlight several constraints of institutional adaptation. For example,
   by abolishing fora for collective decision-making, regime changes
   limited adaptive capacity. To conclude, we argue that such insights into
   traditional resource governance and its adaptability and dynamics over
   time are essential to develop sustainable approaches to participatory
   forest management for the future, both in Harenna and more generally.},

Abstract = {Conventional fishery management largely overlooks scale considerations
   and other complexities, fueling a search for alternative approaches. In
   the approach examined here, the starting point is that fisheries should
   be treated as linked social-ecological systems, leading to
   ecosystem-based management that explicitly includes humans in the system
   and recognizes the interdependent nature of social and ecological
   systems. Given that both ecosystems and social systems operate at
   multiple spatial scales, how do we make the linkages between and within
   levels of the governance system? I approached this objective in three
   steps. First, I explored institutions related to spatial management;
   these are rules of access control and access management, such as
   property rights and territorial use rights. Second, I considered levels
   of the institutional scale and linkages between levels that lead to
   multilevel governance. Third, I used the example of roving bandits to
   demonstrate why marine resources must be managed simultaneously at
   multiple levels and the importance of linkages. Even though roving
   bandits are not susceptible to a single solution, a diversity of
   approaches used together can slow them clown. These include establishing
   property rights and territorial-use rights and building multilevel
   institutions from local to global that can learn from experience.
   Roving-bandit cases offer a number of lessons: the importance of fisher
   knowledge in detecting environmental change, monitoring as an essential
   step in governance, and the need to establish use rights in marine
   resources, the commons problem.},

   study contributes to current research on CPR management by examining the
   process of implementing integrated management planning through the lens
   of CPR design principles. Integrated management plans facilitate the
   management of a complex common pool resource, ground and surface water
   resources having a hydrological connection. Water governance structures
   were evaluated through the use of participatory methods and observed
   records of interannual changes in rainfall, evapotranspiration, and
   ground water levels across the Northern High Plains. The findings,
   documented in statutes, field interviews and observed hydrologic
   variables, point to the potential for addressing large-scale collective
   action dilemmas, while building on the strengths of local control and
   participation. The feasibility of a ``bottom up{''} system to foster
   groundwater resilience was evidenced by reductions in groundwater depths
   of 2 m in less than a decade.},

Abstract = {Bushmeat is often a common pool resource issue and is a major threat to
   wildlife in west and central Africa. Participatory monitoring systems
   have been proposed to both better monitor natural resources and to
   engage resource users in Community Based Natural Resource Management
   systems, in a variety of social-ecological systems. However, studies of
   self-monitoring schemes in bushmeat hunting systems are scarce, and
   there are no empirical studies of the impact of self-monitoring on
   bushmeat hunting. We used a lab-in-the-field common pool resource
   experiment framed around a bushmeat hunting system, in which
   participants made individual decisions on time allocation between
   hunting and farming under three different conditions: without
   communication between group members, with communication, and with
   communication and a self-monitoring system. We found that
   self-monitoring was associated with a lower level of hunting and lower
   rate of resource decline. However, contrary to expectations,
   communication alone was not enough to lower hunting levels. We draw on
   behavioural economic and psychological research on environmental and
   social uncertainty and self-perception to explore how the act of
   self-monitoring could have changed behaviour by changing how
   participants perceived the resource, each other, and themselves. Our
   results support the notion that hunter self-monitoring could be a useful
   tool to initiate behaviour change, as well as providing estimates of
   resource trends.},

Abstract = {Purpose - This theoretical paper explores the learning challenges
   stemming from the need to protect and develop common resources (such as
   a landscape's beauty, an industrial district's reputation or a marine
   area's abundance of fish), and highlights the possible implications of
   these challenges for organizational and evaluation studies.
   Design/methodology/approach - A systematic analysis of carefully
   selected literature is conducted to assess the multi-disciplinary
   contributions of several research streams that, although separated so
   far, are highly complementary to provide a sound basis for understanding
   commons-relating learning dynamics. The literature streams considered
   for this study are: organizational fields, community studies,
   entrepreneurship studies, socio-technical transitions and adaptive
   co-management.
   Findings and originality/value -. The inter-disciplinary
   cross-fertilization conducted in this study allows the authors to build
   an original model that identifies three key learning processes
   intertwining at the field level and impacting the commons: community
   learning, entrepreneurial learning, and ecosystem learning.
   Practical implications - The novel view of field-level, commons-oriented
   learning processes proposed by this study has relevant implications for
   the management of several emerging organizational forms, such as value
   chain networks, place-based networks, policy networks, innovation
   ecologies, science \& technology parks, smart cities \& communities.},

Abstract = {Research on common property and renewable resources has come to be one
   of the more successful research programs on social-ecological systems.
   Much of this research has focused on how different kinds of institutions
   shape the incentives of users who rely on a common-pool resource system
   for a variety of their needs. In the process, this body of work has
   greatly advanced knowledge about how organizations and their rules for
   managing resources can be designed to improve sustainable resource
   governance. A significant puzzle that has occupied the scholarship on
   the commons concerns (1) the differences between formally designed and
   introduced institutions vs. self-organized informal network norms, and
   2) the effects of these differences on resources and governance
   outcomes. This paper analyzes the different effects of informal norms
   and formal organizations and their rules through an agent-based model.
   We examine a model of villagers who choose levels of forest consumption
   based on the information they derive from social interactions with their
   neighbors (an informal network with two-way flow of information) and an
   organization that announces prescribed limits on forest product
   extraction. The paper investigates how changes in the relative
   dependence of users on information from formal rules vs. informal norms,
   and the structure of their social networks affect user behavior,
   harvesting levels, and forest-related outcomes. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {The attributes of social ecological systems affect the management of
   commons. Strengthening and enhancing social capital and the enforcement
   of rules and sanctions aid in the collective action of communities in
   forest fire management. Using a set of variables drawn from previous
   studies on the management of commons, we conducted a study across 20
   community forest user groups in Central Siwalik, Nepal, by dividing the
   groups into two categories based on the type and level of their forest
   fire management response. Our study shows that the collective action in
   forest fire management is consistent with the collective actions in
   other community development activities. However, the effectiveness of
   collective action is primarily dependent on the complex interaction of
   various variables. We found that strong social capital, strong
   enforcement of rules and sanctions, and users' participation in crafting
   the rules were the major variables that strengthen collective action in
   forest fire management. Conversely, users' dependency on a daily wage
   and a lack of transparency were the variables that weaken collective
   action. In fire-prone forests such as the Siwalik, our results indicate
   that strengthening social capital and forming and enforcing forest fire
   management rules are important variables that encourage people to engage
   in collective action in fire management.},

Abstract = {Communities throughout the globe are increasingly being given the
   responsibility of resource management, making it necessary to understand
   the factors that lead to success in community-based management (CBM).
   Here, we assessed whether and how institutional design principles affect
   the ecological outcomes of CBM schemes for Arapaima sp., an important
   common-pool fishery resource of the Amazon Basin. We quantified the
   degree of presence of Ostrom's (Science 325:419-422, 1990) institutional
   design principles in 83 communities using a systematic survey, and
   quantitatively linked the design principles to a measure of ecological
   outcome (arapaima density) in a subset of 39 communities to assess their
   influence. To understand regional patterns of institutional capacity for
   CBM, we evaluated the degree of presence of each principle in all 83
   communities. The principle scores were positively related to arapaima
   density in the 39 CBM schemes, explaining about half of the variation.
   Design principles related to defined boundaries and graduated sanctions
   exerted the strongest influence on the capacity of CBM to increase
   arapaima density. The degree to which most principles were present in
   all 83 communities was generally low, however, with the two most
   influential principles (defined boundaries and graduated sanctions)
   being the least present of all. Although the roles of the other
   principles (management rules, conflict resolution, collective action,
   and monitoring systems) are probably important, our results indicate
   that efforts aimed at strengthening the presence of defined boundaries
   and graduated sanctions in communities hold promise to improve the
   effectiveness of arapaima CBM regionally.},

Title = {Multiple method modelling reveals lack of robustness in natural resource
   management research},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {281},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {Research on natural resource management like fisheries, irrigation
   systems or forestry traditionally uses case studies providing us with a
   rich, in-depth perspective on many single systems. This comes with a
   disadvantage - lacking comparability as differences between studies
   exist in variables examined, their operationalization or methods used.
   Thus, studies often disagree on important drivers for ecological
   success. However, due to design differences the reasons behind different
   results often remain unknown. One reason might be the impact of method
   choice. Hence, this article tests the influence of methods on model
   results. We use a high-quality data set, the Nepal Irrigation
   Institutions and Systems database (NIIS), developed at the Ostrom
   Workshop. It contains 263 cases, each record having information on
   around 600 variables. Multiple machine learning methods - random forests
   (RF), gradient boosting (GBM), shallow neural networks (SNN) and deep
   neural networks (DNN) - are compared with a standard statistical
   approach (multivariate linear regressions (MLR)). We try to answer the
   question whether these methods differ in estimating the relevance for
   success of such well-known concepts like participation of users,
   resource size, relations with other groups, and social capital among
   others. The results indicate that both agreements and substantial
   differences exist across methods which casts doubt on the robustness of
   previous results. Hence, we advise more caution in interpreting existing
   results. We see this research as a step towards increasing the
   robustness of results and improving both generalisability and
   reproducibility of natural resource management research.},

Abstract = {The significant growing of urban population, globalization of
   social-ecological systems, fuzzification of spatial structures, the
   diversity of actors in spatial development, their power and interest in
   using the resources including space, especially in high-density urban
   areas. Spatial development is connected with a high concentration of
   economic activities and population in urban systems. In many cases very
   rapid processes of urbanization and suburbanization approach natural
   spatial/territorial limits, such as carrying capacity of land, transport
   and infrastructural systems, absorption capacities of recipients and
   others {[}1]. Growing shortage of space and problems in their
   accessibility (physical, functional, etc.) leads to growing tension and
   conflicts among the actors/users of urban spaces and represent the
   initial phase of space deprivations processes. There is a parallel with
   ``tragedy of commons{''} as defined by Hardin {[}2] and was
   reinterpreted by many other academics and researchers. Urban space can
   be clearly interpreted as the commons or commons good for their
   community of users and relevant actors, so innovative governance modes
   overlapping defined ``tragedy of commons{''} representing a possible
   approach for a new concept of urban public spaces management. This paper
   presents a possible new approach to the management of urban spaces
   reflecting the current challenges in spatial development based on the
   theory of commons and innovative governance modes. The new approach is
   built on innovations in institutional regimes, the algorithm of
   decision-making and economic expression and interpretation of quality of
   the space. The theory of the commons as the base source for this
   approach has been broadly proved in practice and Elinor Ostrom as the
   author of this theory {[}3-5] was awarded by Nobel Prize in 2009.},

Title = {Kenyan pastoralist societies in transition: varying perceptions of the
   value of ecosystem services},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {19},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {In the drylands of northern Kenya, as elsewhere in Africa, traditional
   pastoralist social-ecological systems are undergoing profound
   transformations. Diminishing resource availability, changing social
   values and governance systems, and new resource management institutions
   challenge the capacity of communities for effective common pool resource
   management. Individuals' values and environmental perceptions play a
   substantial role in decision making regarding resource use and
   management. Additionally, social capital within communities can
   influence cooperative and adaptive resource management. We studied five
   Laikipia Maasai communities in Kenya, which share a common natural
   environment, history, and political organization. We surveyed
   pastoralists' perceptions of the adequacy of two ecosystem services,
   forage availability and livestock abundance. We also assessed indicators
   of three forms of social capital: reciprocity, sanctioning, and norms of
   fairness. Four communities established set-aside conservation areas
   through partnership with external organizations. In those communities,
   we examined residents' perceptions of five different potential
   ecological and economic benefits from the conservation areas. We found
   that communities varied in residents' perceptions of grazing resource
   adequacy, the economic sufficiency of their livestock herds, and the
   benefits of conservation areas. Communities also varied in measures of
   social capital. We contextualize our findings in terms of the rules and
   conditions governing each conservation area, the roles of social
   capital, and the challenges of resource-use trade-offs when perceptions
   diverge. We conclude that taking stock of perceptions and values placed
   on ecosystem services is a crucial element of formulating plans for
   sustainable resource management and navigating trade-offs in the future.},

Title = {Examining the Characteristics of Stakeholders in Lake Tana Sub-basin
   Resource Use, Management and Governance},

   INTEGRATION IN THE LAKE TANA BASIN, ETHIOPIA},
Series = {AESS Interdisciplinary Environmental Studies and Sciences Series},

Pages = {313-346},
Abstract = {The concept of broader participation of stakeholders and more inclusive
   decision making has been increasingly recognized in many countries both
   at national and international level. Effective stakeholder engagement in
   a complex resource system is fundamental to ensure the successful
   implementation of policies at the ground level. Particularly when the
   multi-purpose values of the whole Lake Tana ecosystem are considered,
   there are multiple stakeholders with diverse interests in and power over
   natural resource use, management and governance. Therefore, a clear
   understanding of the potential roles and contributions of the many
   different stakeholders of the Lake Tana social-ecological system is a
   fundamental prerequisite for successful participatory natural resource
   management and governance. Stakeholder analysis is a basic tool for
   achieving this understanding. The overall objective of this chapter is
   therefore, to provide a preliminary description of stakeholders'
   interest in and influence over natural resource use, management,
   governance and policy process in the Lake Tana sub-basin. It depicts the
   stakeholders' landscape based on focus group discussions, key informant
   interviews and stakeholder identification and analysis workshop which
   was carried out by a multidisciplinary team of experts from different
   stakeholder groups (governmental, research, academic and NGOs). The
   results can help inform and assist policy makers in the development of
   sustainable natural resource management policy, taking into account the
   interest and influence of a wide range of stakeholders. The chapter
   begins with a brief introduction of the Lake Tana context. It then
   presents the concept of stakeholder and stakeholder engagement followed
   by the rationale for stakeholder identification and analysis.},

Title = {Co-management: concepts and methodological implications},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {75},
Number = {1},
Pages = {65-76},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Co-management, or the joint management of the commons, is often
   formulated in terms of some arrangement of power sharing between the
   State and a community of resource users. In reality, there often are
   multiple local interests and multiple government agencies at play, and
   co-management can hardly be understood as the interaction of a unitary
   State and a homogeneous community. An approach focusing on the legal
   aspects of co-management, and emphasizing the formal structure of
   arrangements (how governance is configured) runs the risk of neglecting
   the functional side of co-management. An alternative approach is to
   start from the assumption that co-management is a continuous
   problem-solving process, rather than a fixed state, involving extensive
   deliberation, negotiation and joint learning within problem-solving
   networks. This presumption implies that co-management research should
   preferably focus on how different management tasks are organized and
   distributed concentrating on the function, rather than the structure, of
   the system. Such an approach has the effect of highlighting that power
   sharing is the result, and not the starting point, of the process. This
   kind of research approach might employ the steps of (1) defining the
   social-ecological system under focus; (2) mapping the essential
   management tasks and problems to be solved; (3) clarifying the
   participants in the problem-solving processes; (4) analyzing linkages in
   the system, in particular across levels of organization and across
   geographical space; (5) evaluating capacity-building needs for enhancing
   the skills and capabilities of people and institutions at various
   levels; and (6) prescribing ways to improve policy making and
   problem-solving. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {A Complex-Systems Approach to Pastoral Commons},
Journal = {HUMAN ECOLOGY},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {37},
Number = {4},
Pages = {441-451},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {In recent years a new approach has begun to emerge in commons
   scholarship that draws on complex systems thinking and that makes use of
   concepts such as fit, scale, and the adaptive renewal cycle. This paper
   explores what complex systems thinking has to offer for commons
   scholarship by applying these concepts to the pastoral commons of the
   Gabra ethnic group of north-central Kenya. The concepts of fit and scale
   can help us to understand why some features of the institutional regime
   of the Gabra do not conform to mainstream principles such as clearly
   defined boundaries, clearly defined membership rules, and subsidiarity.
   The notion of the adaptive renewal cycle can help us to describe and
   understand some aspects of dynamics of Gabra institutions, especially
   those related to the management of shallow wells. Applying the adaptive
   renewal cycle to larger and longer scales highlights the possibility
   that the Gabra social-ecological system is becoming increasingly
   brittle, with evolving institutional arrangements putting more and more
   constraints on adaptation and especially on nomadic mobility. An
   examination of the distinctive nature of dryland pastoral commons, and
   in particular a complex systems approach to this examination, suggests a
   number of issues that relief and development organizations should
   consider, including how to foster novelty and innovation through all the
   phases of the adaptive cycle.},

Title = {The Contribution of Traditional Agroecological Knowledge as a Digital
   Commons to Agroecological Transitions: The Case of the CONECT-e Platform},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {10},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Traditional agroecological knowledge (TAeK) refers to the cumulative and
   evolving body of knowledge, practices, beliefs, institutions, and
   worldviews about the relationships between a society or cultural group
   and their agroecosystems. These knowledge systems contribute to
   maintaining environmental and culturally sensitive food systems and have
   been considered very relevant for agroecological transitions, or the
   processes of scaling-up and -out agroecology. However, TAeK's erosion
   and enclosure threatens its use and reproduction, which in turn might
   affect TAeK's potential contribution to agroecological transitions.
   Here, we explore how transforming TAeK, and particularly TAeK on
   landraces, into a digital commons can contribute to its maintenance and
   protection, and thus to agroecological transitions. We do so by
   analyzing the CONECT-e platform, an initiative for digitally storing and
   sharing TAeK in a participatory way. One year after being launched,
   CONECT-e has documented 452 geographically distinct landraces from 81
   different species. The information shared in this platform is
   well-structured, clear, and reliable; it thus allows for the replication
   of the knowledge reported. Moreover, because CONECT-e makes the
   documented information freely available and protects it with a copyleft
   license, placing information in this platform could help one face
   landrace misappropriation issues. CONECT-e, or similar initiatives,
   could contribute to agroecological transitions via maintaining TAeK
   under the digital commons framework, making it accessible to all society
   and avoiding enclosure processes.},

Title = {Towards adaptive co-management of small-scale fisheries in Uruguay and
   Brazil: lessons from using Ostrom's design principles},
Journal = {MARITIME STUDIES},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {14},
Month = {JUL 9},
Abstract = {The literature on commons has established the validity and significance
   of Elinor Ostrom's design principles for collective action. Can these
   principles be used to guide policies and initiatives towards adaptive
   co-management? We analyze this idea by using two case studies,
   Piriapolis (Uruguay) and Paraty (Brazil). Both cases are small-scale
   fisheries, and both have been experiencing a social-ecological crisis in
   a context of prevailing top-down government management. However, there
   are signs that government policies are moving towards participatory
   governance. The objective of this article is to identify opportunities
   and barriers to adaptive co-management of small-scale fisheries in
   Uruguay and Brazil using Ostrom's design principles for guidance. Both
   case studies partially meet seven of the eleven design principles (as
   amended by Cox and colleagues), but do not fulfill four. The analysis of
   the fisheries using Ostrom's principles sheds light on the opportunities
   and barriers to adaptive co-management in three categories: resource
   system, resource users, and governance system. Barriers include
   long-standing conflicts between small-scale fishers and government
   agencies, and between small and large-scale fisheries sectors.
   Nevertheless, recent initiatives involving participatory approaches to
   research and management show potential to improve compliance with
   several principles. Two weaknesses of using Ostrom's principles for the
   analysis of the cases were a lack of attention to social learning and
   the exclusion of external drivers.},

Title = {A framework resilient social-ecological system (SES) for groundwater
   governance and public and private rights},
Journal = {GROUNDWATER FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {In groundwater management as a common pool, the participation of the
   beneficiaries faces the problem of free riding. Therefore, it is
   necessary to provide a framework that can minimize the water public
   tragedy and free riding. This article used studies from around the world
   to develop a governance framework for the socio-ecological and
   resilience system and express the function of element resilience within
   this system in protecting groundwater public and private rights. The
   elements of water management were divided into the three subsystems of
   the aquifer, the natural environment, and the community above the
   aquifer, and explained how the elements sustain water services through
   interacting with each other. Also determined how resilience
   characteristics of elements against control variables groundwater,
   challenge public and private rights and cause controversy. The
   discussions showed that the elements and resilience of the elements can
   be different and contradictory to each other and challenge the public
   and private rights of groundwater, which can be very effective in
   building trust and stakeholder participation in water management. The
   SES framework is used in planning and policy-making and determining
   public and private rights, strengthening the resilience of the system,
   and assessing the dynamics of the groundwater system.},

   outcomes across land and seascapes},
Journal = {CONSERVATION LETTERS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {14},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Protecting biodiversity in the face of contemporary conservation
   challenges requires actions across all land and sea tenures. In seeking
   improved conservation outcomes across these tenures, we undertook a
   multidisciplinary review of the property law, conservation and
   environmental ethics literature. Our review revealed three major threats
   of property rights to conservation: a focus on tangible goods at the
   expense of intangible services, a focus on the plot rather than the land
   or seascape and a focus on rights over responsibilities. Our analysis
   reveals that overcoming these threats requires a blending of the
   construct of property with both ecological principlesandsocial values.
   To this end, we offer a practical, solutions-focused approach that seeks
   to determine who has a responsibility, to whom they owe that
   responsibility and how that responsibility can be ascribed. This
   approach couples specific property rights with defined responsibilities
   owed to resource systems to support current and future beneficiaries. A
   formal recognition of the responsibilities that accompany rights can set
   the baseline of what society should be able to expect from
   rights-holders. From this baseline, policy instruments can be more
   appropriately applied, supporting landholders in their responsibilities
   and where necessary, providing compensation for activities that
   extendbeyondtheir responsibilities.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE COMMONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {16},

Pages = {155-172},
Abstract = {The Ci??naga Grande de Santa Marta is a wetland complex characterized by
   its high productivity and different systems of biodiversity use
   associated with water. The Ci??naga receives fresh water from rivers
   descending from the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta. Changes in the water
   dynamics of these rivers since the early twentieth century have been
   causing serious social and ecological changes in the region. The
   Aracataca river is one of these rivers that showed a drastic change in
   its water availability. In this research we study the relation between
   cooperation and hydrological dynamics that shapes the water governance
   system in this basin. The study combines quantitative data obtained from
   the hydrological description and qualitative information derived from
   interviews and a role-playing game workshop, which was analyzed from a
   social-ecological perspective. The analysis shows that the historical
   management of water, characterized by conflicts between individual and
   collective interests, power asymmetries, and the heterogeneity between
   actors, has established a problematic scenario. Our analysis at river
   basin scale showed difficulties in water governance regardless of water
   annual variability, thus requiring structural changes that allow the
   development of coordinated processes toward collective action. This
   research identifies elements that can enrich the management discourses
   of the Aracataca river basin and the Ci??naga as a whole, highlighting
   the importance of understanding environmental issues as problems of
   common pool resources.},

Title = {Mobility in the mangroves: Catch rates, daily decisions, and dynamics of
   artisanal fishing in a coastal commons},
Journal = {APPLIED GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {59},
Number = {SI},
Pages = {98-106},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {This paper integrates institutional theories of the commons with
   insights from geography and human behavioral ecology to explore the
   spatial and temporal dynamics of artisanal fishing in Ecuador's coastal
   mangrove swamps. The focus is on the cockle fishery commons
   characterized by a mixture of formal institutional arrangements and an
   informal division of fishing space that partially influences fisher
   decisions about where and when to fish. Individual decisions are further
   explained to a certain degree by the patch choice model since fishers
   often move on to new grounds when their catch rates fall below average.
   These optimizing strategies requiring rotation within a socially
   produced fishing space may contribute to resource renewal, perceived
   reliable returns for individuals, and a relative stability in fishing
   effort, potentially mitigating against resource depletion in open-access
   areas not managed as a common property regime. This study of the
   interaction between shellfish harvesters, cultural institutions, and the
   environment contributes to a spatially explicit theory of the commons
   and points to the crucial role of resource user mobility and dynamic
   cultural institutions for the ecological sustainability of shellfish
   fisheries. A better understanding of feedback between individual
   decision-making and the self-organization of a social-ecological system
   has critical implications for policy design and fisheries management at
   similar scales. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Human Adaptive Behavior in Common Pool Resource Systems},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {7},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC 28},
Abstract = {Overexploitation of common-pool resources, resulting from uncooperative
   harvest behavior, is a major problem in many social-ecological systems.
   Feedbacks between user behavior and resource productivity induce
   non-linear dynamics in the harvest and the resource stock that
   complicate the understanding and the prediction of the co-evolutionary
   system. With an adaptive model constrained by data from a behavioral
   economic experiment, we show that users' expectations of future pay-offs
   vary as a result of the previous harvest experience, the time-horizon,
   and the ability to communicate. In our model, harvest behavior is a
   trait that adjusts to continuously changing potential returns according
   to a trade-off between the users' current harvest and the discounted
   future productivity of the resource. Given a maximum discount factor,
   which quantifies the users' perception of future pay-offs, the temporal
   dynamics of harvest behavior and ecological resource can be predicted.
   Our results reveal a non-linear relation between the previous harvest
   and current discount rates, which is most sensitive around a reference
   harvest level. While higher than expected returns resulting from
   cooperative harvesting in the past increase the importance of future
   resource productivity and foster sustainability, harvests below the
   reference level lead to a downward spiral of increasing overexploitation
   and disappointing returns.},

Title = {Collective action for changing forests: A spatial, social-ecological
   approach to assessing participation in invasive plant management},
Journal = {GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {71},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Environmental governance research has discovered much about what drives
   collective action to address human environment issues, including factors
   such as risk perceptions and self-efficacy. Yet the design of many
   studies limits our ability to draw conclusions about collective action
   under conditions of environmental change, especially across spatial or
   temporal scales. In this study, we integrate social and biophysical
   data-assessing data over time and examining the influence of space-to
   analyze efforts by community members to manage rapid environmental
   change in the form of an invasive plant (Mikania micrantha) in community
   forests in Chitwan, Nepal. Invasive species are an increasingly complex
   ethical, cultural, and ecological issue that is becoming more pressing
   with global environmental and social changes. We combine household
   surveys, ecological surveys, and spatial data in Bayesian hierarchical
   linear models to explore changes in the drivers of collective action
   since initial household surveys in 2014. We find that risk perceptions,
   reliance on forest resources, perceptions of forest safety, and M.
   micrantha abundance were the most influential factors in our models.
   Additionally, our findings suggest that the influence of M. micrantha
   abundance on collective action varies across spatial scales, indicating
   important interactions between social and biophysical drivers of
   collective action. Ultimately, our results highlight the importance of
   considering social and biophysical factors across space and time to
   inform the design of institutions that will be effective in addressing
   collection action problems tied to environmental change.},

Title = {Governance for Sustainability: Insights from Marine Resource Use in a
   Tropical Setting in the Western Indian Ocean},
Journal = {COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {40},
Number = {6},
Pages = {612-633},
Abstract = {The last decade has seen a shift in the Natural Resource Management
   discourse, a shift from management to governance. Governance is held
   forward as a prime solution to problems associated with the
   sustainability of natural resources, including fisheries and other
   marine resources. Several countries in the Western Indian Ocean are
   framing governance solutions as a response to coastal/marine resource
   depletion and environmental degradation, but the challenges are huge and
   success stories remain few. This study provides an analysis of the
   governance situation in Chwaka Bay, Zanzibar, Tanzania. It presents the
   governance actors and how governance is expressed in terms of hierarchy
   (state), heterarchy (self-organized networks of resource users), and
   anarchy (market). The analysis illustrates the extreme difficulties of
   using governance approaches to steer human behavior to solve
   environmental problems and achieve sustainability. The study also
   provides some insights when considering the use of governance as a tool
   for the ``designing{''} and/or ``steering{''} social-ecological systems
   in subsistence contexts with weak formal institutions. These include the
   consideration of governance as an intrinsic part of complex societal
   processes, the idealization of governance as a template for redressing
   management failure and broader issues such as the importance of
   meta-governance.},

Abstract = {Urban metabolism studies provide valuable insights that can improve
   resource efficiency at the city scale. However, only a limited number of
   such studies include spatially explicit data to inform planning
   practitioners. In this article, we argue that integrating spatially
   explicit urban metabolism data in urban planning can leverage
   resource-efficient development and management of open space networks.
   Based on this premise, our research presents a methodological strategy
   to investigate how the use of GIS data can improve the applicability of
   metabolic studies in urban planning and the management of open space
   networks in particular. A GIS-based urban metabolism assessment of
   Mexico City was performed at the city scale, including data on
   vulnerable communities, communal lands, and indigenous areas. After
   mapping selected GIS layers, a detailed resource-efficiency analysis was
   performed through the compilation of a Borough Pattern Scan, based on
   quantification of resource use, total areas of resource infrastructure,
   and public open spaces. The results of our multiscale spatially explicit
   analysis provide an improved understanding of borough metabolic
   profiles, which can leverage a more resource-efficient development of
   open space networks in Mexico City.},

Title = {Embracing conceptual diversity to integrate power and institutional
   analysis: Introducing a relational typology},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE COMMONS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {12},
Number = {2},
Pages = {330-357},
Abstract = {Within environmental governance scholarship, an increasing interest in
   integrating the study of power with institutional analysis is generating
   novel theoretical and empirical perspectives for understanding
   human-environment relationships. The array of different approaches
   employed to integrate power into institutionalist work promises a range
   of insights. However, building a cohesive research agenda depends on
   efforts to grapple with the conceptual and theoretical diversity that
   characterizes the study of power. To this end, we introduce a typology
   of relationships between power and institutions. The typology brings
   together diverse conceptualizations of power and institutions within a
   common analytical space and situates them around two overarching
   research questions: How does power shape institutions? And how do
   institutions shape power? The structure of the typology aids researchers
   in generating specific, operationalizable research questions within the
   broader research agenda on power and institutions. In the paper, we
   describe the theoretical basis for the development of the typology,
   which draws on political ecology and Bloomington School
   institutionalism. Then, we employ the typology to organize a review of
   environmental governance literature on power and institutions. This
   exercise demonstrates the utility of the typology not only for
   organizing the currently disjointed body of work on power and
   institutions but also for identifying new research questions.
   Furthermore, it facilitates discussions about deeper ontological,
   epistemological, and methodological challenges associated with bringing
   together different theoretical approaches. Ultimately, the typology
   defines pathways for integrating two important disciplines studying
   environmental governance, political ecology and institutionalism, and
   facilitates the accumulation of a coherent body of knowledge.},

   analysis of strengths and weaknesses to inform policy},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {77},
Pages = {44-55},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This study analyzed the governance of the Cassuruba Extractive Reserve
   or RESEX in Bahia State, Brazil, exploring the favorable conditions and
   the difficulties faced by this newly established and complex governance
   system. RESEXS are protected areas that involve traditional communities
   in its administration through majority representation in a Deliberative
   Council (DC). Research was conducted through literature and documents
   review, participant observation through direct involvement in community
   activities along several years (20082016), and semi-structured and
   structured interviews applied respectively to members of the DC and to
   users of the RESEX during 2012 and 2013. The Institutional Design
   Principles were used as an analytical tool to reflect on the strengths,
   limitations, and the multiple factors affecting its governance.
   Interview results suggest a more negative perception of resource users
   about RESEX functioning and prospects than DC members. Participation of
   resource users in RESEX meetings was low and a passive performance of
   council members was observed. Since 2012-2013, participation of users
   and council members has been gradually increasing. Several of the design
   principles were found to be present (boundaries, congruence, collective
   arrangements though enhanced participation is needed, conflict
   resolution mechanisms, recognition of rights to organize, nested
   enterprises), and only two were deemed insufficient or mostly absent:
   monitoring (4A and 4B), but improving in terms of community
   participation in vigilance, and graduated sanctions (5), present in
   legislation but hardly implemented. Further studies should be pursued
   for continuing adding blocks to the understanding of CPR governance
   systems with diverse degrees of complexity.},

Year = {2018},

Abstract = {Small-scale irrigation systems are important for agricultural
   productivity in dryland agroecosystems, particularly in areas where
   there is significant intra- and interannual changes in rainfall
   patterns. Institutional analysis of common-pool resources has
   demonstrated the principles that tend to result in sustained water
   governance systems. However, previous work did not fully articulate the
   nested nature of institutions and how polycentric arrangements can play
   a role in both the formation and the ongoing maintenance of these
   governance systems. To better understand collective action across water
   user groups and decision-makers at multiple governance levels, we
   undertake a multilevel analysis of Kenya's polycentric approach to water
   governance, in place since reforms were initiated in 2002. Survey and
   interview data indicate that in the postreform period, water users in
   Kenya's Upper Ewaso Ng'iro basin engaged in behaviors associated with
   collective action, including reduced water use by upstream users to
   address downstream users' needs. We examine the factors that promote
   collective action in the region, asking whether features associated with
   polycentric governance have helped to promote collective action. We find
   that the presence of multiple decision centers with overlapping
   authority over water governance functions creates necessarybut not
   sufficientconditions for collective action to occur. Regulations and
   formal conflict resolution mechanisms provide incentives for water users
   to cooperate, while shared membership in regional Water Resource Users
   Associations facilitates informal opportunities for users to share
   information and build trust over time.},

Title = {Governing large-scale social-ecological systems: Lessons from five cases},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE COMMONS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {8},
Number = {2},
Pages = {428-456},
Abstract = {This paper compares lessons drawn from five case studies of large scale
   governance of common-pool resources: management of forests in Indonesia,
   the Great Barrier Reef in Australia, the Rhine River in western Europe,
   the Ozone layer (i.e. the Montreal Protocol), and the Atlantic Bluefin
   Tuna (i.e. the International Convention on the Conservation of Atlantic
   Tuna). The goal is to assess the applicability of Ostrom's design
   principles for sustainable resource governance to large scale systems,
   as well as to examine other important variables that may determine
   success in large scale systems. While we find support for some of
   Ostrom's design principles (boundaries, monitoring, sanctions, fit to
   conditions, and conflict resolution mechanisms are all supported), other
   principles have only moderate to weak support. In particular,
   recognition of rights to organize and the accountability of monitors to
   resource users were not supported. We argue that these differences are
   the result of differences between small and large scale systems. At
   large scales, other kinds of political dynamics, including the role of
   scientists and civil society organizations, appear to play key roles.
   Other variables emphasized in common-pool resource studies, such as
   levels of dependence on resources, group size, heterogeneity,
   disturbances, and resource characteristics also receive mixed support,
   pointing to the need to reinterpret the meaning of common-pool resource
   theories in order for them to be applicable at larger scales.},

Abstract = {Marine renewable energy (MRE), though a relative newcomer to the ocean
   and coastal commons, has become a significant driver of marine spatial
   planning in the US, posing particular challenges to commercial fisheries
   and fishing communities. State and federal agencies with primary
   oversight for MRE development have focused on the identification of
   places where MRE might proceed unhindered by other uses, most notably
   coastal fisheries. These agencies and MRE developers have focused on
   potential space-use conflict and standard mitigation measures for loss
   of access to that space. However, discussions with fishery participants
   and other community members, as well as observations of processes on the
   US West and East Coasts, reveal a complex, multi-faceted
   social-ecological system not easily parsed out among users, nor amenable
   to classic mitigation formulas. Recent ethnographic research on
   potential space-use conflicts and mitigation for MRE demonstrates that
   marine space use is dynamic and multi-dimensional, with important
   linkages among fisheries, communities and other interests. Although
   experiences vary within and across regions and fishing communities, this
   research illustrates the weak position of fishing communities in marine
   spatial planning in the context of MRE development. This paper considers
   the implications of MRE for US East and West Coast fisheries and fishing
   communities situated within the larger context of neoliberalism and
   commodification of the ocean commons. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.. All rights

Abstract = {Large hydrologic basins involve multiple stakeholders, and coupled
   dynamic social and ecological processes. Managing such basins has long
   been a challenge. Balancing the demand for water from nature against
   that from humans is always difficult, particularly in arid watersheds.
   Here, we analyze potential institutional causes of ecological
   degradation and how it can be reversed by introducing new forms of
   governance. The framework and assumptions are illustrated using China's
   second-largest endorheic basin, where empirical evidence shows that the
   introduction of a new governing authority connecting midstream and
   downstream actors facilitated the establishment of a new governance
   regime that is better aligned with the biophysical scales of the
   watershed. A trans-regional water allocation project initiated by the
   new higher-level authority successfully rescued downstream oases and
   restored a dried terminal lake. These outcomes suggest that when social
   and ecological structures are better aligned our ability to manage the
   interplay between social and ecological processes increases. However,
   the lack of direct connection between the actors of the middle and lower
   reaches resulted in the paradox of an increase in water demand. We
   therefore suggest that measures to stimulate the emergence of horizontal
   social ties linking different critical groups of actors across the
   watershed could further the alignment of the institutional and
   biophysical structures-without these changes sustainable management of
   river basins and other common pool resources will remain problematic.

Abstract = {The oceans, as a common-pool resource, are facing an ever increasing
   number of crises and challenges, and the promotion of marine protected
   area (MPA) management is viewed as the best path to resolving such
   issues. This paper takes MPA management in Green Island as the basis for
   its analysis, employing the method of participant observation with the
   aim of discussing changes that occur in institutional partnerships
   throughout the process of MPA management. Results show that, in Green
   Island, in accordance with developmental requirements, there was a trend
   for partnerships to become increasingly complex, and for community level
   organizations to have close ties. Outside organizations are the spark
   that ignites MPA mechanisms, but such organizations first have to court
   the trust of the local people, in order to successfully promote their
   establishment. When community partnership networks mature, further
   challenges to their power develop. `Learning-as-participation' can go
   some way to reducing conflicts that arise from power struggles. As well
   as this, local intermediary organizations play a key role in the
   development of institutional linkages, their main functions being
   coordination of inter-organizational communication, resources
   integration, and expansion of partnership networks. Such organizations
   are unique in their promise of an `indefinite' service, and so can build
   close ties with fundamental community organizations.},

Title = {The interplay between formal and informal institutions and the potential
   for co-management in a Mexican small-scale fishery},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {121},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Understanding how institutions operate is crucial to the protection of
   marine ecosystems and the communities that depend on them. We define
   institutions as the rules, norms, and practices that govern resource
   users' interactions with common-pool resources, and recognize that both
   formal and informal institutions govern marine fisheries around the
   world. Institutional diversity can enhance social-ecological system
   resilience by providing multiple ways of responding to change.
   Identifying institutions and their effects on fishing practices is key
   to improving management for sustainable fisheries. In this study, we use
   a mixed methods approach focused on the institutions guiding fishing
   activities of the Mexican chocolate clam, Megapitaria squalida, in
   Loreto Bay National Park, Baja California Sur, Mexico. By synthesizing
   long-term observations and semi-structured interviews with fishers and
   other key stakeholders, we identify the formal and informal rules and
   norms governing fishing behavior, explore their effects on fishing
   practices, and illuminate ways in which formal and informal institutions
   may work in tandem. We find that both formal and informal institutions
   shape fishing practices within the chocolate clam fishery. Some
   reinforce one another, and others are in conflict. The diverse
   institutions governing the chocolate clam fishery create a complex web
   of sometimes conflicting rules and social norms that fishers navigate
   every day. We contend that greater community participation in
   management, via polycentric and collaborative governance that accounts
   for and legitimizes local norms in a system like co-management, would
   foster enhanced sustainability of the chocolate clam fishery and the
   benefits it provides to coastal communities.},

Abstract = {The articles in this special feature challenge the presumption that
   scholars can make simple, predictive models of social-ecological systems
   (SESs) and deduce universal solutions, panaceas, to problems of overuse
   or destruction of resources. Moving beyond panaceas to develop
   cumulative capacities to diagnose the problems and potentialities of
   linked SESs requires serious study of complex, multivariable, nonlinear,
   cross-scale, and changing systems. Many variables have been identified
   by researchers as affecting the patterns of interactions and outcomes
   observed in empirical studies of SESs. A step toward developing a
   diagnostic method is taken by organizing these variables in a nested,
   multitier framework. The framework enables scholars to organize analyses
   of how attributes of (i) a resource system (e.g., fishery, lake, grazing
   area), (ii) the resource units generated by that system (e.g., fish,
   water, fodder), (iii) the users of that system, and (iv) the governance
   system jointly affect and are indirectly affected by interactions and
   resulting outcomes achieved at a particular time and place. The
   framework also enables us to organize how these attributes may affect
   and be affected by larger socioeconomic, political, and ecological
   settings in which they are embedded, as well as smaller ones. The
   framework is intended to be a step toward building a strong
   interdisciplinary science of complex, multilevel systems that will
   enable future diagnosticians to match governance arrangements to
   specific problems embedded in a social-ecological context.},

Journal = {CONSERVATION LETTERS},

Volume = {6},

Abstract = {Effective conservation requires people to make choices about how they
   interact with the environment. Social characteristics influence the
   likelihood of establishing conservation actions with strong compliance
   (hereafter ``feasibility{''}), but are rarely considered in conservation
   planning. Our study makes two contributions to understand feasibility.
   First, we explicitly test the associations between social
   characteristics and the presence and form of resource management.
   Second, we compare the ability of different types of data to elucidate
   feasibility. We use Ostrom's (2007) thinking on social-ecological
   systems and literature on resource management in Melanesia to create a
   context-specific framework to identify social characteristics that
   influence feasibility for conservation management. We then apply this
   framework and test for associations between the presence and form of
   management on one hand and social characteristics on the other, using
   data collected at different resolutions. We found that conservation
   feasibility was associated with characteristics of the governance
   system, users, and the social, economic, and political setting. Villages
   with different forms of management were more similar to each other
   socially than to villages without management. Social data collected at
   the resolution of households accounted for over double the variation in
   the form and presence of management compared to data at the resolution
   of villages. Our methods can be adapted to conservation planning
   initiatives in other socioeconomic settings.},

Title = {Common pool resources dilemmas in tropical inland small-scale fisheries},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {82},
Pages = {119-126},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The aim of this study is to describe how small-scale fishery (SSF)
   organizations of the Centla Wetland Biosphere Reserve (Tabasco, Mexico)
   face the common-pool resource dilemmas, such as competition for fishing
   areas and spots, physical interferences, and the diminution of
   communitarian benefits. Moreover, we assess the relation between the
   degree of self-management and fishery parameters (e.g., species catch
   rates and capture size, gear efficiency). Based on the fishermen's
   self-organization capacity we identified three organizational levels:
   low, medium, and high. Low impact fishing gear (e.g., hooks,
   fishing-spear) and low fishing effort (3.19 +/- 1.41 h per fishing trip)
   were characteristic of organizations with a high level of
   self-organization, associated with closed fishing areas. By contrast,
   organizations with low and medium levels of organization, predominantly
   found in open-access areas, were mainly characterized by the use of
   gillnets and high fishing effort (6.17 +/- 4.35 h per fishing trip).
   Higher catch rates (e.g., for the species Centropomus undecimalis
   {[}1.93 +/- 1.40 kg trip(-1) h(-1)] and Cichlasoma urophthalmum {[}1.78
   +/- 1.52 kg trip(-1) h(-1)]) were observed in organizations with a high
   organizational level. Fishery strategies and fishery parameters were
   different among organizations with different self-organizational levels
   as indicated by a multivariate redundancy analysis. The
   self-organization of SSF to manage fishery resources can be a valuable
   tool for the conservation of natural resources in small-scale inland
   fisheries, reducing vulnerability to adverse external factors. Moreover,
   it provides an economic reserve against regional and national economic
   and political reforms. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Information network topologies for enhanced local adaptive management},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {35},
Number = {2},
Pages = {175-193},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {We examined the principal effects of different information network
   topologies for local adaptive management of natural resources. We used
   computerized agents with adaptive decision algorithms with the following
   three fundamental constraints: (1) Complete understanding of the
   processes maintaining the natural resource can never be achieved, (2)
   agents can only learn by experimentation and information sharing, and
   (3) memory is limited. The agents were given the task to manage a system
   that had two states: one that provided high utility returns (desired)
   and one that provided low returns (undesired). In addition, the
   threshold between the states was close to the optimal return of the
   desired state. We found that networks of low to moderate link densities
   significantly increased the resilience of the utility returns. Networks
   of high link densities contributed to highly synchronized behavior among
   the agents, which caused occasional large-scale ecological crises
   between periods of stable and high utility returns. A constructed
   network involving a small set of experimenting agents was capable of
   combining high utility returns with high resilience, conforming to
   theories underlying the concept of adaptive comanagement. We conclude
   that (1) the ability to manage for resilience (i.e., to stay clear of
   the threshold leading to the undesired state as well as the ability to
   re-enter the desired state following a collapse) resides in the network
   structure and (2) in a coupled social-ecological system, the system-wide
   state transition occurs not because the ecological system flips into the
   undesired state, but because managers lose their capacity to reorganize
   back to the desired state.},

Title = {Confronting problems of method in the study of sustainability},
Journal = {FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {42},
Pages = {42-50},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Methodological challenges have confounded studies of the commons for
   much of its recent history. These problems range from a large number of
   potentially influential variables, difficulties in capturing and
   measuring these variables, and large sets of interacting and mediating
   factors. With respect to quantitative methods, a specific dilemma is
   their use at or beyond their methodologically accepted limits. More
   specifically, this paper explores the potential implications of applying
   multinomial logistic regression techniques in small samples. It does so
   by drawing upon published data from the International Forestry Resources
   and Institutions (IFRI) program to explore potential problems of method
   from prominent research findings in the literature on forest commons. A
   subset of the results is then compared to a similar study of tropical
   deforestation. The results point to considerable inconsistency in the
   sign of parameter estimates, and a large number of type II errors.
   However, they also suggest that type I errors are relatively rare. As a
   whole, this paper demonstrates the general reliability of multinomial
   logistic regression in small samples by showing that statistically
   significant parameters are unlikely to lead policymakers in the wrong
   direction. Nevertheless it also suggests that this approach is likely to
   overlook several influential factors, posing potential dilemmas for the
   development of a theory of sustainability. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Volume = {57},

Abstract = {Small-scale fisheries are important for preventing poverty, sustaining
   local economies, and rural livelihoods, but tend to be negatively
   impacted by traditional forms of management and overexploitation among
   other factors. Marine Areas for Responsible Fishing (Areas Marinas de
   Pesca Responsable, AMPR) have emerged as a new model for the
   co-management of small-scale fisheries in Costa Rica, one that involves
   collaboration between fishers, government agencies, and NGOs. The
   primary objective of this paper is to elucidate some of the key
   variables that influence collective action among small-scale fishers in
   Tarcoles, a community in the Gulf of Nicoya. We examined collective
   action for the formation of a local marketing cooperative and
   participation in management through the AMPR. We apply the
   social-ecological framework as a diagnostic and organizational tool in
   the analysis of several types of qualitative data, including interviews
   with key informants, informal interviews, legal documents, and gray
   literature. Findings illustrate the importance of socio-economic
   community attributes (e.g., group size, homogeneity, previous
   cooperation), as well as that of social (e.g., equity) and ecological
   (e.g., improved stocks) outcomes perceived as favorable by actors. In
   addition, our work demonstrates the importance of certain kinds of
   external NGOs for facilitating and sustaining collective action.},

Title = {Integrating Institutions with Local Contexts in Community-Based
   Irrigation Governance: A Qualitative Systematic Review of Variables,
   Combinations, and Effects},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE COMMONS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {15},
Number = {1},
Pages = {320-337},
Abstract = {The literature on common-pool resources (CPRs) has mostly focused on
   institutional conditions for successful governance of the commons.
   However, many scholars have emphasized that the explanatory power of
   institutional variables per se is limited and that institutions should
   not be isolated from the context in which they operate. Consequently,
   the success of CPR governance requires a more nuanced understanding of
   specific combinations of institutions in a specific social-ecological
   context. Using community based irrigation systems as an example, this
   paper examines how combinations of institutions and contexts affect
   irrigation governance based on a qualitative systematic review of 83
   English language peer-reviewed articles published since 1990. The review
   firstly summarizes the basic characteristics, main research subjects,
   and development trends in the literature on community-based irrigation
   governance. Then, revealing the specific effects of major combinations
   of institutional variables and contextual variables on the performance
   of irrigation governance, the review suggests that (a) the congruence of
   institutional arrangements with attributes of actors (e.g., group size,
   group heterogeneity, and social capital), (b) the specific combination
   of institutions and contexts of resource system and related ecosystems
   (e.g., hydrology, soil, and agriculture), and (c) the market incentives
   (e.g., irrigation systems' spatial proximity to markets) associating
   with formal governance organizations, are important for improving
   irrigation governance performance. The main findings not only reveal
   existing gaps in understanding how institutions and contexts interact in
   community-based irrigation governance, but also indicate potential
   pathways to theoretical construction in complex CPR systems by further
   exploring the relationships between institutions and the contexts in
   which they operate.},

Title = {Institutions of farmer participation and environmental sustainability: a
   multi-level analysis from irrigation management in Harran Plain, Turkey},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE COMMONS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {7},
Number = {1},
Pages = {73-91},
Abstract = {This paper examines the relationship between farmer participation and
   environmental sustainability from an institutional perspective in the
   context of Harran Plain, one of the newest and largest irrigated areas
   in Turkey. Harran Plain undergoes social, economic and institutional
   change due to the expansion of large-scale irrigation and the
   establishment of irrigation associations. These changes, however,
   trigger an environmental change in the form of waterlogging and soil
   salinisation. The concepts of `institutional scale' and `institutional
   alignment' are applied to critically analyse the narratives regarding
   the causes of excessive water use, which is a collective action problem
   playing a significant role in increased waterlogging and soil salinity
   in Harran Plain. Empirical findings demonstrate that a low degree of
   institutional alignment among the rules at different levels constitutes
   an obstacle against taking actions to prevent excessive water use. Major
   issues are identified as the lack of water rights at plot and district
   levels; the exclusion of farmers from the planning of irrigation
   seasons; the inefficient monitoring of irrigation frequencies and fee
   collections, and the lack of mechanisms to monitor the operations of
   irrigation associations. The application of institutional scale and
   institutional alignment also contribute to the understanding of
   social-ecological systems by facilitating the systematic analysis of
   institutions and the identification of areas for institutional change.},

Title = {Modeling Soft Institutional Change and the Improvement of Freshwater
   Governance in the Coastal Zone},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {16},
Number = {4},
Abstract = {The contribution of soft institutional change to improve freshwater
   governance in the coastal zone will be examined. Freshwater management
   seeks to reduce losses due to overexploitation of the common-pool
   resources provided by river catchments and their associated ecosystems.
   Due to the complexity of the governance system, improving the
   performance of one coastal social-ecological system means searching for
   the appropriate ``soft{''} institutional change. In the Pertuis
   Charentais region, increasing scarcity of freshwater in summer threatens
   the health of the coastal ecosystem and the sustainability of human
   activities, which depend on the use of natural resources. The allocation
   of freshwater among competing uses or concerns is a core issue for
   integrated coastal zone management. To address this issue, we have
   constructed an analytical framework that combines the ecosystem services
   approach with the institutional analysis of common-pool resources, and
   have developed an integrated simulation tool based on the system dynamic
   modeling approach. Freshwater scarcity generates three kinds of user
   conflict: (1) conflict between two extractive uses of freshwater
   (irrigation and drinking water), (2) conflicts between extractive uses
   (provisioning services) and other services (support, regulatory, and
   cultural) provided by freshwater, and (3) competition within a given
   activity sector (agriculture or shellfish farming). Participation by
   local managers led to the identification of realistic soft institutional
   changes that might mitigate conflicts and improve the governance system.
   These possible institutional changes were then integrated as fixed
   exogenous parameters in the simulation model. The simulated scenarios
   suggest that innovative collective arrangements involving farmers could
   be an alternative to other more restrictive top-down measures. This
   participatory experiment also illustrates the potential of
   social-ecological modeling for exploring acceptable new institutional

   common-pool resource systems},

Abstract = {Understanding how and when cooperative human behaviour forms in
   common-pool resource systems is critical to illuminating
   social-ecological systems and designing governance institutions that
   promote sustainable resource use. Before assessing the full complexity
   of social dynamics, it is essential to understand, concretely and
   mechanistically, how resource dynamics and human actions interact to
   create incentives and pay-offs for social behaviours. Here, we
   investigated how such incentives for information sharing are affected by
   spatial dynamics and management in a common-pool resource system. Using
   interviews with fishermen to inform an agent-based model, we reveal
   generic mechanisms through which, for a given ecological setting
   characterized by the spatial dynamics of the resource, the two `human
   factors' of information sharing and management may heterogeneously
   impact various members of a group for whom theory would otherwise
   predict the same strategy. When users can deplete the resource, these
   interactions are further affected by the management approach. Finally,
   we discuss the implications of alternative motivations, such as equity
   among fishermen and consistency of the fleet's output. Our results
   indicate that resource spatial dynamics, form of management and level of
   depletion can interact to alter the sociality of people in common-pool
   resource systems, providing necessary insight for future study of
   strategic decision processes.},

Title = {Factors Influencing Small-Scale Fishers' Individual Perceived Wellbeing
   Satisfaction in Southern Benin},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {11},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In southern Benin, the rapid growth of demographics and the need for
   fishery products have forced public managers to adopt various management
   measures in the face of anti-ecological methods used by fishers;
   however, these strategies are often formulated independent from the
   context. These measures have not remained without consequence on the
   daily lives of fishers. This paper examines factors influencing fishers'
   individual perceived wellbeing satisfaction using the social-ecological
   system framework. Data on 205 small-scale fishers' demographic
   information, perception of job, and individual wellbeing satisfaction
   and governance subsystems were collected and analysed by the use of an
   ordered logistic regression. The results demonstrate that job
   satisfaction and ownership of water bodies (in contradiction to Ostrom's
   advocation for commons management) affected fishers' individual
   perceived wellbeing satisfaction. Fishers likely value ownerships,
   affecting their perceived wellbeing mainly in the South East. The
   prohibition of certain fishing gear decreases fishers' individual
   perceived wellbeing, indicating their attachment to these. Therefore,
   the question remains as to whether or not the scenarios of
   eco-sustainability of artisanal fisheries can be managed in the same
   manner as those related urban dwellers and the public sector. This is in
   particular reference to the line between urban land property rights,
   urban dwellers and the state, and property rights on water bodies,
   fishers, and the state.},

Title = {Can Nationally Prescribed Institutional Arrangements Enable
   Community-Based Conservation? An Analysis of Conservancies and Community
   Forests in the Zambezi Region of Namibia},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {19},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Community-based conservation is advocated as an idea that long-term
   conservation success requires engaging with, providing benefits for, and
   establishing institutions representing local communities. However,
   community-based conservation's efficacy and impact in sustainable
   resource management varies depending on national natural resource
   policies and implications for local institutional arrangements. This
   paper analyses the significance of natural resource management policies
   and institutional design on the management of common pool resources
   (CPRs), by comparing Namibian conservancies and community forests. To
   meet this aim, we reviewed key national policies pertinent to natural
   resource governance and conducted 28 semi-structured interviews between
   2012 and 2013. Key informants included conservancy and community forest
   staff and committee members, village headmen, NGO coordinators, regional
   foresters, wildlife officials (wardens), and senior government officials
   in the Ministry of Environment and Tourism and the Ministry of
   Agriculture, Water and Forestry. We explored the following questions:
   how do national natural resource management policies affect the
   operations of local common pool resource institutions? and how do
   external factors affect local institutions and community participation
   in CPRs decision-making? Our results show that a diversity of national
   policies significantly influenced local institutional arrangements.
   Formation of conservancies and community forests by communities is not
   only directly linked with state policies designed to increase wildlife
   numbers and promote forest growth or improve condition, but also
   formulated primarily for benefits from and control over natural
   resources. The often-assumed direct relationship between national
   policies and local institutional arrangements does not always hold in
   practice, resulting in institutional mismatch. We aim to advance
   theoretical and applied discourse on common pool resource governance in
   social-ecological systems, with implications for sustainable land
   management policies in Namibia and other landscapes across sub-Saharan
   Africa.},

Abstract = {This manuscript examines marine resource users' perceptions of,
   experiences with, and responses to federal and territorial fisheries
   management processes in St. Croix, United States Virgin Islands. Drawing
   on anthropological critiques of common pool resources (CPR) institutions
   and political ecology, I describe the historical, social, and political
   factors that influence how fisheries management occurs at multiple
   scales and how it is experienced by fishers, managers, and other
   stakeholders. This multi-scale approach is both timely and important, as
   resources and communities throughout the world are increasingly global
   zed and interconnected ; it is virtually impossible to find an example
   of a CPR being managed at the local scale, devoid of the influence of
   external factors. As a result, it is becoming more common for resources
   and resource users to be subject to regulations and management regimes
   at multiple levels and scab (such as federal and territorial). For this
   reason, it is critical to examine how management institutions across
   scales impact one another and influence key elements of management, such
   as stakeholder participation. Fisheries management in St. Croix provides
   an opportunity to explore how the complexities of multi-scale resource
   management occur at the local level and how resource users and other
   stakeholders experience and perceive those processes. Specifically, this
   manuscript describes whether and how fishers and other marine resource
   stakeholders participate in management processes and how factors such as
   demographic heterogeneity, historical patterns of social group
   interactions, and the complexity of management processes influence
   participation.},

Abstract = {Off the western coast of Sumatra among the islands of Pulau Banyak,
   fishing is the primary occupation for the men of Haloban. They are
   self-described ``traditional{''} fishers, using low-tech gear and small
   boats to catch fish, octopus, lobster, and other sealife in the nearby
   coral reefs and mangroves. Women also regularly venture out into the
   deep mud of the mangroves to collect clams. Their efforts to extract
   livelihoods and subsistence from the reefs take place in an open-access
   commons with few formal institutions or enforcement mechanisms to
   regulate resource use. While explicit regulations and customary
   limitations on fishing in the coral reef commons are lacking, Haloban
   fishers improvise some common etiquette and practices that are adaptable
   to the shifting context.
   This case study presents Haloban fishers' use of the commons as situated
   practices, unarticulated and embedded within a complex social ecological
   system. These practices reflect fishers' understanding of, and
   relationship with, their environment, and may represent a nascent form
   of local ``rules-in-use{''}, informing behavior without direct social
   mechanisms for enforcement. This paper presents research collected using
   ethnographic methods, including participant observation at sea. As NGOs
   and government agencies work to craft management plans that share use of
   the reefs with tourism and conservation, a better understanding of
   actual resource use and fishing practice may inform more nuanced,
   adaptable, and truly ``local{''} community-based management. (C) 2014

Title = {Simulating the outcomes of resource user- and rule-based regulations in
   a coral reef fisheries-ecosystem model},
Journal = {GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {38},
Pages = {58-69},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Many political ecology debates hinge on the roles and outcomes of
   resource user regulation versus those arising from governance rules.
   Because of the difficulties of empirically testing theories of resource
   regulation, we evaluated the alternatives using a simulation modeling
   approach developed for East African coral reef fisheries where four
   scenarios of fisheries regulation on fish catch rates and resource
   ecology were evaluated. These scenarios were (1) a control simulation
   where fishing practices were held constant, (2) fishing that gradually
   incorporates fishers' self-reported behavioral responses to declining
   resources, (3) rapid change where illegal gears were not allowed and
   effort was equally partitioned among the legal gears, and (4) gradual
   change where legal gears or exiting were adopted as yields decline. The
   model indicates that at moderate fishing effort (5 fishers/km(2)), the
   gradual behavioral change scenarios two and four produced the highest
   per fisher yields and maintained the highest fish biomass compared to
   the other two strict-control options. At high fisher numbers (10
   fishers/km(2)), the rapid ban of illegal gear in scenario 3 had more
   similar ecological outcomes to gradual behavioral response scenarios 2
   and 4. The model assumed no changes in behavior coming from outside the
   system or over longer periods of time that could potentially undermine
   or change the stated behavioral responses. The simulations show the
   difficulty of developing resource use regulations because of the complex
   interactions between numbers of fishers, behavioral responses,
   management decisions, and feedbacks to the resource. Nevertheless, the
   simulations indicate that at moderate fisher densities, governance
   strategies that allow resource users to respond to changing resources
   can produce better yield and resource outcomes than rigid control.
   Ecosystem models that do not incorporate fisher's behavioral choices may
   overestimate their detrimental impacts. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {Cooperation is central to collective management of small-scale fisheries
   management, including marine protected areas. Thus an understanding of
   the factors influencing stakeholders' propensity to cooperate to achieve
   shared benefits is essential to accomplishing successful collective
   fisheries management. In this paper we study stakeholders' cooperative
   behavioral disposition and elucidate the role of various socio-economic
   factors in influencing it in the Roviana Lagoon, Western Solomon
   Islands. We employed a Public Goods Game from experimental economics
   tailored to mimic the problem of common pool fisheries management to
   elucidate peoples' cooperative behavior. Using Ostrom's framework for
   analyzing social-ecological systems to guide our analysis, we examined
   how individual-scale variables (e.g., age, education, family size,
   ethnicity, occupational status, personal norms), in the context of
   village-scale variables (e.g., village, governance institutions, group
   coercive action), influence cooperative behavior, as indexed by game
   contribution. Ostrom's framework provides an effective window for
   conceptually peeling back the various socio-economic and governance
   layers which influence cooperation within these communities. The results
   of our research show that the most important resource user
   characteristics influencing cooperative behavior were age, occupation
   and beliefs about giving access to others to fish for commercial gain.
   Through elucidating the factors affecting stakeholders' propensity to
   cooperate to achieve shared benefits, our analysis provides guidance in
   understanding cooperation in relation to collective management of marine
   resources. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {The Promise of Collective Action for Large-Scale Commons Dilemmas:
   Reflections on Common-Pool-Resource Theory},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE COMMONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Pages = {47-63},
Abstract = {It has become axiomatic that collective action is core to overcoming
   commons dilemmas. However, the popularity of the commons dilemma framing
   has led to its decoupling from canonical common-pool-resource cases.
   This decoupling is especially problematic for theorizing under what
   conditions collective action would emerge to solve complex, large-scale
   environmental problems, such as climate change, biodiversity loss, or
   ocean hypoxia. We argue that there is an over-emphasis on using
   diagnostic tools (e.g., the design principles), which has come at the
   expense of theory building for non-canonical cases. Canonical cases,
   such as fisheries, forests, or irrigation networks, rely on situations
   where salience of social dilemmas arises from joint costs and benefits
   actors face from allocating and sustaining a shared pool of
   livelihood-dependent resources. By expanding the commons definition to
   more generally mean shared needs or benefits, such as ecosystem
   services, the consequences of uses in large-scale CPRs, such as
   pollution, become less obvious. In this paper, we argue that it is
   particularly urgent to generate a revised theory of collective action
   for these types of cases, where environmental bads are core to the
   social dilemma. We contend that Ostrom's design principles represent a
   particular set of solutions to several interconnected and foundational
   aspects of group problem-solving: generating salience, achieving
   widespread participation, and ensuring compliance over time. We argue
   that reconceptualizing how particular institutional arrangements address
   salience, participation, and compliance can expand CPR theory's
   applicability to these large-scale problems and help to clarify the role
   that collective action can play in solving these pressing challenges.},

Title = {Adapting Governance Incentives to Avoid Common Pool Resource Underuse:
   The Case of Swiss Summer Pastures},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {10},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The use of summer pastures in the European Alps provides much evidence
   against Hardin's prediction of the tragedy of the commons. For
   centuries, farmers have kept summer pastures in communal tenure and
   avoided its overuse with self-designed regulations. During the past
   decades, however, summer pastures have become less intensely used, which
   has reduced its agronomic value and the by-production of public goods.
   However, very little is known about how the various governance
   incentives affect farmers' use of summer pasture to result in
   below-sustainable activity. In this study, we develop an empirically
   informed game theoretical model of farmers' land use decisions, which we
   validate with survey data from a case study in Switzerland. Our results
   reveal that farmers weigh the benefit of resource use against the costs
   of maintaining it and that all major sectoral developments, such as
   increasing livestock endowment, increasing opportunity costs, and
   decreasing land use intensity on private plots, result in the reduced
   use of summer pastures. Based on these insights, we suggest adapting the
   incentive structure at the local and federal governance levels to
   increase incentives for stocking at the margin. Our study shows how game
   theory combines with field validation to identify the contextual
   behavioral drivers in common pool resource dilemmas for informed and
   improved policy making.},

Title = {Effects of Diverse Property Rights on Rural Neighbourhood Public Open
   Space (POS) Governance: Evidence from Sabah, Malaysia},
Journal = {ECONOMIES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Number = {2},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {There are severe issues of public open space (POS) underinvestment and
   overexploitation. However, few studies have been conducted on the
   property rights structure and its impacts on rural commons governance,
   specifically concerning local neighbourhood residential POS quality and
   sustainability. The social-ecological system framework and the new
   institutional economics theory were employed to examine the local
   diverse property rights system and its effects on the emergence of POS
   dilemmas. Rural commons covering neighbourhood residential Country Lease
   (CL) and Native Title (NT) POS from the districts of Kota Kinabalu and
   Penampang, Sabah Malaysia were selected. A mixed-method phenomenological
   case study, involving multi-stakeholders' perspectives across
   public-private-user sectors, was employed. This study revealed four main
   interconnected property rights issues, including attenuated rights,
   incomplete rights, maladaptive rights, and security-based de facto
   perceptive rights, under the complex state-private regime, which
   incentivise the opportunistic behaviour of individuals in externalising
   POS commons dilemmas. The findings further inferred that the local
   diverse property rights issues and POS dilemmas caused, and are
   associated with, other rights issues and dilemmas, forming a
   rights-dilemmas nexus. Not only do the institutional failures actuate
   POS dilemmas, but the former also engender other forms of property
   rights failures, while the latter cause other POS dilemmas. This paper
   suggests policy and management insights to public officials, in which
   the importance of the institutional-social-POS behavioural factor and
   the re-engineering of POS governance via adaptive property rights
   realignment are emphasised.},

Title = {Questioning Mountain Rural Commons in Changing Alpine Regions. An
   Exploratory Study in Trentino, Italy},
Journal = {REVUE DE GEOGRAPHIE ALPINE-JOURNAL OF ALPINE RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {109},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Most of rural resources in the Italian mountain territories, such as
   forests, pastures, huts, mountain paths, have historically been governed
   through collective organizations and institutions that have guaranteed
   the balance between productive activities and environmental protection.
   These systems can be framed according to the literature on commons.
   Although the model of collective resource management is still strongly
   rooted in the Alpine region, socioeconomic changes underway call into
   question the way resources are conceived, used and managed by
   communities and the very concept of community as a reference for a
   collective resource. Few studies have focused on the transformation and
   adaptation of commons to the changes taking place, such as the
   progressive penetration of global economic and demographic megatrends at
   the local level, with the aim of decoding the new tension between
   community needs and societal needs. By referring to the concepts of
   resilience and transformability of social-ecological systems, this paper
   aims to reflect on the impact of the socioeconomic transformations
   underway in mountain rural regions, to search for new approaches for the
   conceptualization of commons and to investigate how commons can be
   transformed in order to make them resilient and more socially inclusive.
   For that, an extensive literature review and an exploratory fieldwork
   using a case study approach have been performed. The paper's results are
   exploratory, from which working hypotheses have been derived to be
   explored in further studies. These hypotheses relate to socio-economic
   and cultural practices as well as approaches that would enable the
   reembedding of the commons in the economy and society undergoing change.},

Title = {Institutional designs of customary fisheries management arrangements in

Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {36},

Abstract = {There are considerable efforts by governments, non-governmental
   organizations (NGOs), and academia to integrate marine conservation
   initiatives and customary practices, such as taboos that limit resource
   use. However, these efforts are often pursued without a fundamental
   understanding of customary institutions. This paper examines the
   operational rules in use and the presence of institutional design
   principles in long-enduring and dynamic customary fisheries management
   institutions in Papua New Guinea, Indonesia, and Mexico. Rather than a
   ``blue print{''} for devising long-enduring institutions, this study
   relies on the design principles as a starting point to organize an
   inquiry into the institutional diversity found in customary governance
   regimes. Three important trends emerged from this comparative analysis:
   (1) despite it being notoriously difficult to define boundaries around
   marine resources, almost 3/4 of the cases in this study had clearly
   defined boundaries and membership; (2) all of the customary institutions
   were able to make and change rules, indicating a critical degree of
   flexibility and autonomy that may be necessary for adaptive management;
   (3) the customary institutions examined generally lacked key
   interactions with organizations operating at larger scales, suggesting
   that they may lack the institutional embeddedness required to confront
   some common pool resources (CPR) challenges from the broader
   socioeconomic, institutional and political settings in which they are
   embedded. Future research will be necessary to better understand how
   specific institutional designs are related to social and ecological
   outcomes in commons property institutions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {Indigenous Communities residing inside or next to autochthonal forests
   conserved them through governance frameworks that invoked traditional
   sacral law and reverence for their resource commons. More recently,
   however, the link between communities and forest conservation has been
   mired by dynamics of dispossession and displacement. Through a
   qualitative case study approach, using key informant interviews,
   transect walks, focus groups, and interviews, the researchers explore
   the conservation dynamics in Loita, in the South of Kenya, specifically
   looking at the sacred Enaimina Enkiyio forest. The study evaluated how
   the Loita community has challenged two state initiatives predicating
   conservation efforts and mobilised the sacred to conserve their resource
   commons. It combines a social-ecological approach with social innovation
   theory, spiritual geography, cultural studies and literature on
   indigenous knowledge systems, looking at, among others, sacred values
   attributed to places, nature-culture relationships, and value and belief
   systems and rituals. The findings point to the embeddedness of the
   forest resource in the way of life of the Loita Maasai and the
   appropriation of the ritual/sacred element as a framework to negotiate
   and mediate access, use, and conservation outcomes. The Loita community
   is grappling with and responding to the pressures exerted by various
   forces on the Loita Enaimina Enkiyio in socially innovative ways, as
   exemplified in the conservation efforts by the Ilkimpa Community
   Conservation Association (ICCA). It leverages aspects of the sacred in
   negotiating its claims over the Enaimina Enkiyio forest, showing that
   community-driven initiatives present alternative approaches capable of
   maintaining the connection between communities and their resource
   commons by integrating the sacred in this connection.},

Title = {Do social identity and cognitive diversity correlate in environmental
   stakeholders? A novel approach to measuring cognitive distance within
   and between groups},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {16},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV 4},
Abstract = {Groups with higher cognitive diversity, i.e. variations in how people
   think and solve problems, are thought to contribute to improved
   performance in complex problem-solving. However, embracing or even
   engineering adequate cognitive diversity is not straightforward and may
   even jeopardize social inclusion. In response, those that want to
   promote cognitive diversity might make a simplified assumption that
   there exists a link between identity diversity, i.e. range of social
   characteristics, and variations in how people perceive and solve
   problems. If this assumption holds true, incorporating diverse
   identities may concurrently achieve cognitive diversity to the extent
   essential for complex problem-solving, while social inclusion is
   explicitly acknowledged. However, currently there is a lack of empirical
   evidence to support this hypothesis in the context of complex
   social-ecological systems-a system wherein human and environmental
   dimensions are interdependent, where common-pool resources are used or
   managed by multiple types of stakeholders. Using a fisheries example, we
   examine the relationship between resource stakeholders' identities and
   their cognitive diversity. We used cognitive mapping techniques in
   conjunction with network analysis to measure cognitive distances within
   and between stakeholders of various social types (i.e., identities). Our
   results empirically show that groups with higher identity diversity also
   demonstrate more cognitive diversity, evidenced by disparate
   characteristics of their cognitive maps that represent their
   understanding of fishery dynamics. These findings have important
   implications for sustainable management of common-pool resources, where
   the inclusion of diverse stakeholders is routine, while our study shows
   it may also achieve higher cognitive coverage that can potentially lead
   to more complete, accurate, and innovative understanding of complex
   resource dynamics.},

Title = {Polycentric governance of multifunctional forested landscapes},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE COMMONS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {6},
Number = {2},
Pages = {104-133},
Abstract = {Human-induced causes of forest change occur at multiple scales. Yet,
   most governance mechanisms are designed at a single level - whether
   international, national, regional or local - and do not provide
   effective solutions for the overarching challenge of forest governance.
   Efforts to ``decentralize{''} governmental arrangements frequently do
   not recognize the importance of complex, polycentric arrangements and
   are based on a presumption of a single government at one level taking
   charge of a policy arena, often ignoring the existence of many vibrant
   self-governed institutions. Polycentric institutions provide a useful
   framework for governance, enabling aspects of preferred solutions to be
   used together in efforts to protect the long-term sustainability of
   diverse forested social-ecological systems. By considering the
   interaction between actors at different levels of governance,
   polycentricity contributes to a more nuanced understanding of the
   variation in diverse governance outcomes in the management of
   common-pool resources based on the needs and interests of citizens and
   the complexity of resources and governance systems at local, regional,
   national, and global levels. In this paper, we discuss challenges to
   polycentricity such as the matching of the boundaries of those who
   benefit, those who contribute with the boundary of the resource. We
   describe some approaches that have been effectively utilized to address
   these challenges in forests in various parts of the world. We also
   provide a brief overview of how the concept of polycentricity helps in
   the analysis of climate change and the closely related international
   effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through degradation and
   deforestation (REDD).},

Title = {An Institutional Economics Framework to Explore Sustainable Production
   and Consumption},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {27},
Pages = {1317-1339},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Although policy actions are being taken by many governments around the
   world on sustainable development, the application of institutional
   economics to sustainable development is still in its infancy. In the
   literature, there are a wide range of institutional economics frameworks
   deployed to explore aspects of sustainable development, but the majority
   focus on common pool resources or social ecological systems, often with
   a high focus on extractive parts of the economy, not consumption and
   upstream provision choices that drive the extraction. The current paper
   presents an institutional economics framework to address sustainable
   production and consumption. The research draws on literature,
   experiential knowledge and theory to construct the framework. The
   resulting framework leads to an institutional economics understanding of
   embeddedness for exploring sustainable production and consumption; an
   extended and wider conceptualisation of value and resources in the light
   of sustainable production and consumption; An exploration of governance
   structures (markets and organisations) as value and values articulating
   institutions in the light of sustainable production and consumption.
   Less work is conducted at the level of institutional environment, but by
   exploring literature examples of changes advocated at this level by
   scholars, it becomes apparent that changes beyond property rights can be
   used to bring forth sustainable production and consumption. The paper
   concludes by setting out that an institutional economics approach to
   sustainable consumption and production entails a `cultural shift'
   towards more sustainable consumption; innovation in governance
   structures (for both markets and firms) towards sustainable production
   (and consumption); alongside changes in the institutional environment
   (including law) to create a selection environment where sustainable
   production and consumption can flourish. (C) 2021 Institution of

Title = {Unpacking the challenges of wildlife governance in community-based
   conservation programs to promote human-wildlife coexistence},
Journal = {CONSERVATION SCIENCE AND PRACTICE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {4},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {One of the numerous global challenges today is how to promote
   biodiversity persistence and at the same time reduce poverty and improve
   livelihoods, especially in multiple-use landscapes shared by people and
   wildlife. In such landscapes, where the cost of sharing the landscape
   with large wildlife can be high, Community Based Natural Resource
   Management (CBNRM) program is a model promoted to offset negative
   wildlife impacts. However, such programs, that promote sustainable
   utilization of wildlife, are not always successful. To better understand
   how CBNRM governance systems enable or hinder human-wildlife
   coexistence, I implemented an 11-weeks participatory co-learning program
   in conservancies in the Zambezi region of Namibia. Framing
   human-wildlife relationships as occurring within complex
   social-ecological systems, participatory dialogues were used to unpack
   the system to better understand why human-wildlife conflict remains a
   challenge after 30 years of CBNRM in Namibia. From listening to
   communities I identified five key areas requiring improvement: (1)
   inefficient communication and transfer of information between management
   and community; (2) lack of policy and process clarity; (3) lack of
   support, knowledge, resources, and implementation of mitigation
   measures; (4) lack of accountability by both management and conservancy
   members; and (5) lack of skills and capacity by both management and
   conservancy members. To address these problem areas, I propose three key
   priority actions: (1) harmonize conservancy policies and management
   practices; (2) improve information flow; and (3) implement an adaptive
   management mitigation measure program. While this study focused on a
   small part of Namibia, I expect this methodology and many of the key
   findings and proposed interventions will be relevant for other areas
   applying collaborative approaches to improve human-wildlife coexistence.},

Title = {Local politics of floodplain tenure in the Amazon},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE COMMONS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-20},
Abstract = {Research on community-based management system has been often grounded on
   monolithic institutional, social and ecological perspective with focus
   on the commoners as the only local actor, collective territorial rights
   as the only local tenure system, and the managed resource unit or
   ecosystem as the only contested resource driving collective action.
   However, CBMSs are embedded in local social-ecological systems usually
   characterized by multiple ruling systems, different local groups, and
   heterogeneous ecological systems. In this paper I discuss how the
   floodplain tenure system is negotiated and rearranged between two local
   groups - community residents and large landholders. This complex and
   dynamic arrangement comprises three layers of property rights which are
   combined according to changing ecological and social context. Based on
   longitudinal empirical data spanning 20 years of research, I describe
   the history of contemporary human occupation, and the most recent
   socioeconomic and institutional changes in the region in order to unpack
   the dynamics of the floodplain tenure in the region. I conclude that
   assumptions that integration of local management system into a formal
   legal framework suffices to achieve an efficient co-management system is
   rather simplistic. Despite major structural changes in the formal tenure
   framework, power relations between different local users may remain
   unchanged unless local perceptions and everyday life practices of power
   relations are changed. Unpacking the multiple ruling systems and
   everyday life practices that mediate interactions between different
   local actors is fundamental to understanding how the commons are
   appropriated at the local level. Therefore, a local contextualization of
   the social and ecological structure is crucial to reveal potential
   barriers to the development of an inclusive and sustainable production
   system.},

Title = {Ecosystem services and ecological degradation of communal wetlands in a
   South African biodiversity hotspot},
Journal = {ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {6},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Wetlands provide important ecosystem services to rural communities.
   However, wetlands are often on communal land, so they may become
   degraded when individual users act to maximize their personal benefit
   from ecosystem services without bearing the full environmental costs of
   their actions. Although it is possible to manage communal resources
   sustainably, this depends on the dynamics of the socio-ecological
   system. In this study, we used a structured questionnaire to examine
   whether demographic characteristics of a rural community and the
   propensity for partaking in damage-causing activities affected the
   benefits obtained from the wetlands. Responses from 50 households in the
   rural Hlabathi administrative area within the Maputo-Albany-Pondoland
   Biodiversity Hotspot, South Africa, indicated that the entire community
   obtains some benefits from wetlands; most notably regulating ecosystem
   services. However, males were more likely to benefit from wetlands,
   which highlights a potential power imbalance. Respondents were more
   likely to blame others for wetland degradation, although there was no
   link between the damage-causing activities and benefits from wetlands.
   The high dependence on ecosystem services by community members, when
   combined with gender-based power imbalances and the propensity to blame
   others, could jeopardize the sustainable use of communal wetlands.
   Therefore, we describe how strong leadership could nurture a sustainable
   social-ecological system by integrating ecological information and
   social empowerment into a multi-level governance system.},

Volume = {18},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {115-131},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {This article combines Aoki's institutional complementarity concept with
   actor-centered institutional analysis of action situations to study
   herder behavior and institutional change in a complex pastoral
   social-ecological system. Transformation of the Mongolian Steppe
   Ecosystem in the face of climate and social change has led to a decline
   in pastoral mobility, which in turn is making the ecosystem less
   sustainable. Responding to this concern, Mongolian policymakers have
   designed pasture use and conservation policies. We evaluate whether the
   enacted policies are complementary to herders' strategic choices. First,
   we reconstruct institutional choices herders make in the commons domain,
   where herders interact to use common pastures. Second, we track this
   process in the political economy domain, where pasture users support or
   resist government policies. Finally, we evaluate the complementarity of
   the strategic choices and resulting institutions in the interdependent
   action situations of both domains. In combination with game-theoretic
   model building, we have employed the process tracing method during field
   research in Mongolia. We have not identified any evident, stable
   institutional complementarity between high pastoral mobility and support
   for a policy of leasing and certification of land for winter and spring
   camps. Conversely, our findings do suggest that policies for
   establishing pasture user groups and pasture use planning can be
   effective. A critical mass of herders choosing to comply with these
   policies and engage in pastoral mobility will be crucial for sustaining
   the ecosystem. This will strengthen conditions for institutional
   complementarity and create a new institutional arrangement overall.},

Title = {Effects of livelihood strategies on mangrove-forest resource Do the
   consumption behaviour of households jeopardise the forest resource base?},
Journal = {MANAGEMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {25},

Abstract = {Purpose-The cumulative effects of climate change exacerbate interruption
   of social-ecological system. The purpose of this paper is to investigate
   whether the consumption smoothing along with other socioeconomic
   parameters of households affects the common pool resource base of a
   forest in an economic depression resulted from climate change triggered
   disasters.
   Design/methodology/approach-This paper is a field level study of Koyra
   sub-district in the Southwestern coastal region of Bangladesh. Several
   parameters namely climatic trends and events, damage pattern suffered by
   households, change in land ownership and occupation pattern and
   consumption dependency pattern were considered. Methods used for data
   collection were household questionnaire survey and focus group
   discussions in the study area.
   Findings-Both the intensity and frequency of climate change led
   catastrophes are found higher in the study area resulting damage of
   assets and capital goods of households. The average annual disaster
   damage borne by per household is found US\$177. Over the last two
   decades 8.21 per cent households become landless. During same time span
   more than 25 per cent households switched from cropping to other
   non-agricultural occupations and more than 26 per cent households depend
   on forest resource for their consumption smoothing.
   Originality/value-The paper provides insights how climate change led
   disasters induce the households to depend on the resource from the
   mangrove forest Sundarbans for their livelihood earning as well as
   consumption smoothing.},

Abstract = {Urban gardens have been observed to multiply in response to crises.
   However, the meaning and motivations behind the emergence of gardening
   movements varies greatly over space and time. In this paper we argue
   that bottom up urban gardening initiatives taking place in Southern
   European countries in form of land occupation and communalization
   represent forms of resistance that enhance social cohesion and
   collective action in times of need. Specifically, this research examines
   the role of urban gardens in (i) building community resilience and (ii)
   articulating forms of resistance and contestation to development
   pressure and commodified urban lifestyles. Our research is based on data
   collected among 27 urban gardening initiatives in Barcelona, Spain,
   including 13 self-governed community gardens and 14 public gardens. Data
   were collected from semi-structured interviews with gardeners and with
   staff from the Barcelona City Council. Our results show mechanisms
   through which urban gardens can contribute to build resilience by
   nurturing social and ecological diversity, generating and transmitting
   local ecological knowledge, and by creating opportunities for collective
   action and self-organization. We further examine collectively managed
   gardens as urban commons that emerge as a form of resistance to the
   privatization of public urban space, and that offer opportunities to
   experiment with new models of urban lifestyles. We show how gardening
   initiatives can be seen to represent an emerging form of urban green
   commons that provides a suitable ground to ` sow' resilience and
   contestation in times of crises and socio-ecological deterioration.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE COMMONS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {8},

Abstract = {In this paper we use a case study of the Rhine River to examine the
   relevance of Common Pool Resource (CPR) Theory for two conditions in
   which it has not been extensively tested: large scale international
   water management and pollution problems. For that purpose, we link
   variation in pollution abatement to a set of explanatory variables
   proposed by CPR theory. Causal inference is established through process
   tracing and a series of within-case comparison across actor groups (i.e.
   riparian nations, industry, and agriculture), resource types (i.e. point
   source, and non-point source pollutants), and time periods (1976-1986,
   when treaties provided a limited basis for collective action and
   pollution abatement, and 1987-2001, when the Rhine Action Plan proved
   more successful). According to our analysis, a number of CPR variables
   can help understanding cooperation for pollution abatement in the Rhine
   case. These include physical attributes such as clear hydrological
   boundaries; governance factors such as the articulation of monitoring
   and decision-making at different governance levels and the proportional
   allocation of costs and benefits of abating pollution; and actor factors
   like the small size, trust and homogeneity of some actor groups and
   leadership. Other variables proposed by CPR theory proved to be
   irrelevant or in need of qualification. These include the right to
   self-organize and to participate in decision-making, communication and
   resource-dependence. Finally, two variables, not emphasized by CPR
   theory, proved relevant: the occurrence of external disturbances and the
   role of interest groups. We conclude that CPR theory is valuable for
   explaining pollution management in large transboundary river basins, but
   requires qualification and extension.},

Title = {The production of contested landscapes: Enclosing the pastoral commons
   in Niger},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES},

Volume = {51},
Pages = {125-140},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Divergent adaptation to climate variability produces unequal adaptive
   capacities between user groups and contributes to a contested landscape.
   This article examines divergent adaptations in the context of land
   tenure shifts in the pastoral zone of Niger. The management of the
   pastoral commons is shifting from a commonly-shared to private regime as
   former pastoralists take up new livelihoods, such as irrigated
   gardening. A method combining political ecology and remote sensing is
   used to study social ecological system (SES) dynamics in order to
   demonstrate the relationship between divergent adaptation, water-based
   conflict, land tenure shifts and land use/land cover change. Examining
   pastoral and agro-pastoral users' historical perceptions of land use and
   tenure change, results indicate that disputes over the access to and use
   of commonly shared natural resources are linked to increasing enclosures
   of ephemeral and permanent lakes in the pastoral zone of Niger. Remote
   sensing-derived information is used to identify and quantify the area
   and volume of enclosures around commonly shared water sources in the
   northern pastoral zone of Niger from 2003 to 2013. The study identifies
   the government-supported development of irrigated gardens in the
   pastoral zone as a divergent adaptation with its related conflict
   dynamics between user groups and highlights the land tenure shifts from
   a commonly to a privately managed regime. The findings have broader
   implications for the wider Sahel and provide recommendations as to how
   adaptation programs could be better designed and implemented in the
   pastoral system. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {African community-based conservation: a systematic review of social and
   ecological outcomes},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {23},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {Community-based conservation (CBC) institutions are widely regarded as
   transformative bodies that benefit social and ecological processes in
   coupled social-ecological systems. Yet, limited empirical evidence for
   this claim exists, especially on the African continent where
   community-based conservancies (CBCs) are being rapidly adopted in
   diverse institutional forms across multiple countries. We provide the
   first large-scale systematic review of CBC outcomes in sub-Saharan
   Africa. We review the literature on CBCs and develop a conceptual model
   that illustrates the nested scales of interaction in which CBCs are
   embedded, the institutional processes ({''}conditions{''}) reported as
   important for success, and the outcomes of CBCs on social and ecological
   systems. The mixed-method approach consists of inductive/deductive
   textual analysis of cases, geospatial visualization, descriptive
   statistics, and correlational analysis. Results indicate that more often
   than not, establishment of CBCs in Africa has led to negative or a
   mixture of positive and negative social outcomes, whereas ecological
   outcomes have been largely positive. The research conducted on CBC
   institutions has overwhelmingly focused on social outcomes, using
   qualitative methods. Monetary and nonmonetary incentives seem to be
   important but not sufficient on their own for positive outcomes.
   Devolution of rights to the local community is significantly associated
   with CBC outcomes but was not present in many cases, despite this
   feature being a hallmark of CBCs. A number of conditions were not
   reported in the cases reviewed, including leadership, social learning,
   consideration of cultural worldviews, and diverse partnerships. We
   provide indepth examples of the types and diversity of outcomes and
   contexts underpinning the presence or absence of societal processes,
   highlight important gaps in the existing research, and offer guidelines
   for research and evaluation moving forward.},

Abstract = {The monitoring of ecosystems and the spread of information concerning
   their state among human stakeholders is often a lengthy process. The
   importance of mutual feedbacks between socioeconomic and ecological
   dynamics is being increasingly recognised in recent studies, but it is
   generally assumed that the feedback from the environment is
   instantaneous, ignoring any delay in the spread of ecosystem knowledge
   and the resulting potential for system stability loss. On the other
   hand, human actors rarely make purely myopic socioeconomic decisions as
   is often assumed. Rather, they show a degree of foresight for future
   utility which may have an opposing, stabilising effect to any delay in
   knowledge. In this paper, we consider a generic resource-harvester model
   with delayed ecosystem knowledge and predictive behaviour by the
   harvesters. We show that delays in the spread of information about the
   resource level can destabilise the bioeconomic equilibrium in the system
   and induce harvesting cycles or the collapse of the resource.
   Sufficiently farsighted prediction by the harvesters can stabilise the
   system, provided the delay is not too long. However, if the time horizon
   of prediction is too long relative to the timescale of resource growth,
   prediction can be destabilising even in the absence of delay. The
   results imply that effective monitoring of ecosystems and fast
   dissemination of the results are necessary for their sustainable use and
   that efforts to promote appropriate foresight among ecosystem users on
   the personal and institutional level would be beneficial to the
   stability of coupled socioeconomic-ecological systems.},

Title = {Enabling Environments? Examining Social Co-Benefits of Ecosystem-Based
   Adaptation to Climate Change in Sri Lanka},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {3},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {Climate change vulnerability and social marginalisation are often
   interrelated in and through environments. Variations in climate change
   adaptation practice and research account for such social-ecological
   relations to varying degrees. Advocates of ecosystem-based approaches to
   climate change adaptation (EbA) claim that it delivers social
   co-benefits to marginalised groups, although scant empirical evidence
   supports such claims. I investigate these claims in two EbA
   interventions in Sri Lanka, interpreting social benefits through an
   empowerment lens. I use qualitative methods such as focus groups and
   narrative interviews to study the conduct and context of the
   interventions. In both cases, marginalised people's own empowered
   adaptive strategies reflect how power relations and vulnerabilities
   relate to dynamic ecologies. The findings show that EbA enabled social
   benefits for marginalised groups, especially through support to
   common-pool resource management institutions and the gendered practices
   of home gardens. Such conduct was embedded within, but mostly peripheral
   to, broader and deeper contestations of power. Nevertheless, projects
   acted as platforms for renegotiating these power relations, including
   through acts of resistance. The results call for greater recognition of
   the ways that marginalised groups relate to ecology within empowered
   adaptive strategies, whilst also highlighting the need to recognise the
   diverse interests and power relations that cut across the conduct and
   contexts of these nominally ecosystem-based interventions.},

Title = {Joint Effects of Asymmetric Payoff and Reciprocity Mechanisms on
   Collective Cooperation in Water Sharing Interactions: A Game Theoretic
   Perspective},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {8},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG 28},
Abstract = {Common-pool resource (CPR) dilemmas distinguish themselves from general
   public good problems by encompassing both social and physical features.
   This paper examines how a physical mechanism, namely asymmetric payoff;
   and a social mechanism, reciprocity; simultaneously affect collective
   cooperation in theoretical water sharing interactions. We present an
   iterative N-person game theoretic model to investigate the joint effects
   of these two mechanisms in a linear fully connected river system under
   three information assumptions. From a simple evolutionary perspective,
   this paper quantitatively addresses the conditions for Nash Equilibrium
   in which collective cooperation might be established. The results
   suggest that direct reciprocity increases every actor's motivation to
   contribute to the collective good of the river system. Meanwhile,
   various upstream and downstream actors manifest individual disparities
   as a result of the direct reciprocity and asymmetric payoff mechanisms.
   More specifically, the downstream actors are less willing to cooperate
   unless there is a high probability that long-term interactions are
   ensured; however, a greater level of asymmetries is likely to increase
   upstream actors' incentives to cooperate even though the interactions
   could quickly end. The upstream actors also display weak sensitivity to
   an increase in the total number of actors, which generally results in a
   reduction in the other actors' motivation for cooperation. It is also
   shown that the indirect reciprocity mechanism relaxes the overall
   conditions for cooperative Nash Equilibrium.},

Title = {Critical Commons Scholarship: A Typology},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE COMMONS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {13},
Number = {2},
Pages = {1112-1127},
Abstract = {Common-pool resource theory (CPR theory) emerged to understand the
   limitations of the tragedy of the commons narrative, and the theory of
   human behavior underlying it. Over time, diverse critiques of CPR theory
   have also emerged. Prominent critiques include inattention to power and
   coercion, assumptions that institutions can be crafted, and analyses
   that exclude history and context, among others. We label this literature
   critical commons scholarship. In this review paper, we define a typology
   of five types of critical commons scholarship. The functionalist
   critique (type 1) argues that a narrow focus on institutions that
   excludes history, context, and contingencies causes erroneous
   conclusions about the causes of resource sustainability. The apolitical
   management critique (type 2) argues that a focus on resource
   sustainability causes commons scholars to ignore how power is used to
   create and maintain inequalities through rules and norms structuring
   resource access. The methodological critique (type 3) argues that
   methodological incompatibilities, such as CPR theory's dependence on
   general, abstract models, necessarily prevent these scholars from
   responding to type 1 and type 2 critiques. The project of government
   critique (type 4) argues that common-pool resource theory is used to
   support neoliberal and hegemonic practices. Finally, the ethical
   critique (type 5) argues that common-pool resource theory is premised on
   problematic north-south relationships where expert scholars in the
   global north provide information to be consumed by ``commoners{''} in
   the global south. Mainstream CPR theory has been limited in engaging
   with critical commons scholarship, but there are new tools (such as the
   social-ecological systems framework and the critical institutionalism
   approach) for addressing each type of critique. Our goal in developing
   this typology is to make critiques of CPR theory legible and potentially
   actionable, while acknowledging the challenges associated with
   addressing them.},

Title = {Neoliberal and neo-communal herring fisheries in Southeast Alaska:
   Reframing sustainability in marine ecosystems},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {61},
Pages = {366-375},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The transformation of Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii) fisheries from
   communal to commons to neoliberal regulation has had significant impacts
   on the health and sustainability of marine ecosystems on the Northwest
   Coast of North America. Due to their abundance, seasonality, and
   sensitivity in disturbance, herring were carefully cultivated and
   protected by coastal Tlingit, Haida, and Tsimshian communities. The
   early industrial fishing era undermined this communalist approach in
   favor of an unregulated commons for bait and reduction fisheries,
   attracting non-local fleets and leading to conflicts with local Natives
   and tragedy of the commons style overexploitation of herring stocks by
   the mid-twentieth century. Since the 1970s, a re-regulated neoliberal
   sac roe fishery for Japanese markets has provided new opportunities for
   limited commercial permit holders, but with further depredations on
   local spawning populations. This paper uses frame theory and historical
   and political ecology to show how this transformation was justified by
   three critical but dubious (re)framings of Southeast herring populations
   under modern scientific management: (1) a reductionist framing of single
   species productivity models, expressed as herring ``biomass,{''} within
   space and time (baseline scale framing); (2) the selective framing and
   privileging of human industrial predation under maximum sustainable
   yield (MSY) within a dynamic ecosystem of multiple predator populations
   (actor relations framing); and (3) the strategic framing of spawning
   failure events and policy responses to those events by professional
   fisheries managers (event-response framing). Finally, the paper argues
   for a new social-etological systems approach, based on aboriginal models
   of herring cultivation, to sustain a commercial, subsistence, and
   restoration economy for the fishery. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Quantitative pathways for Northeast Atlantic fisheries based on climate,

Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MODELLING},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {320},
Pages = {273-291},
Month = {JAN 24},
Abstract = {Here we present quantitative projections of potential futures for
   ecosystems in the North Atlantic basin generated from coupling a climate
   change-driven biophysical model (representing ecosystem and fish
   populations under climate change) and a scenario-driven
   ecological-economic model (representing fleets and industries under
   economic globalization). Four contrasting scenarios (Baseline, Fortress,
   Global Commons, Free Trade) were defined from the perspective of
   alternative regional management and governance of the oceanic basin,
   providing pathways for the future of ecosystems in the Northeast
   Atlantic basin by 2040. Results indicate that in the time frame
   considered: (I) the effects of governance and trade decisions are more
   significant in determining outcomes than the effects of climate change
   alone, (2) climate change is likely to result in a poleward latitudinal
   shift of species ranges and thus resources, with implications for
   exploitation patterns, (3) the level of fisheries regulation is the most
   important factor in determining the long term evolution of the fisheries
   system, (4) coupling climate change and governance impacts demonstrates
   the complex interaction between different components of this
   social-ecological system, (5) an important driver of change for the
   future of the North Atlantic and the European fishing fleets appears to
   be the interplay between wild fisheries and aquaculture development, and
   finally (6) scenarios demonstrate that the viability and profit of
   fisheries industries is highly volatile. This study highlights the need
   to explore basin-scale policy that combines medium to long-term
   environmental and socio-economic considerations, and the importance of
   defining alternative sustainable pathways. (C) 2015 Published by

Journal = {SOCIOLOGICA-ITALIAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY ON LINE},
Year = {2007},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {Developing a coherent theory of collective action that is also relevant
   for practice in explaining local development is a major challenge. At
   the individual level, individuals do take costly actions that
   effectively take the interests of others into account in many field and
   experimental settings but this is not consistent with contemporary game
   theory. We need to move ahead to achieve a more coherent synthesis of
   theoretical work that posit variables affecting the success or failure
   diverse forms of collective action. The first section of this paper
   discusses the growing and extensive theoretical literature positing a
   large number of structural variables presumed to affect the likelihood
   of individuals achieving collective action to overcome social dilemmas.
   None of these structural variables, however, would change predictions if
   one uses the model of rationality that has proved successful in
   explaining behavior and outcomes in competitive market settings as a
   universal theory of human behavior. Thus, the second section examines
   how a theory of boundedly rational, norm-based human behavior is a
   better foundation for explaining collective action than a model of
   maximizing material payoffs to self. The third section examines the
   linkage between the structural measures first discussed with the
   individual relationships discussed in the second. The fourth section
   looks at how changing the rules of a focal dilemma in deeper arenas in
   efforts to improve the net benefits from collective action by affecting
   the structural variables of the focal arena. The conclusion reflects on
   the challenge that social scientists face in testing collective-action
   theory in light of the large number of variables posited to affect
   outcomes.},

Abstract = {Since civil wars hit rural areas intensely, Rural Producer Organizations
   (RPO) -as forms of long-term collective action or cooperation among
   small farmers- are considered essential for peacebuilding. However, the
   factors underpinning the formation and performance of RPO postwar are
   unclear. Based on a case study in the municipality of Planadas,
   Colombia, where the former communist guerrilla Revolutionary Armed
   Forces of Colombia - People's Army - FARC-EP was formed and several
   associations flourished post-war, this article identifies 14 contextual
   factors facilitating the rise of RPO. Contrasting the findings with
   variables identified by collective action, commons theory, and
   literature on RPO, it was determined that four additional contextual
   variables play a critical role in RPO development post-war, namely,
   legacies of war, resilience strategies, institutional intermediaries,
   and discourses. Legacies of war refer to the vestiges left by the kind
   of relationship developed between the main armed actor and the civilians
   in wartime. Economic activity as a resilience strategy indicates
   civilians' strategies to stay aside from the confrontation, reducing the
   probability of being harmed and preventing their involvement in the war
   or illegal economic activities. Intermediary institutions are
   third-party organizations that influence RPO. In the case considered,
   this role was developed by certification schemes known as Voluntary
   Sustainability Standards. Controverting critical literature on the
   effects of the standards, the results suggest that they can enhance
   self-organizing capacities post-conflict at the local level. Finally,
   discourses refer to additional incentives for RPO development regarding
   what participants consider valuable beyond economic benefits.
   Consequently, the article presents the foundations of an expanded
   framework to understand and foster RPO growth in post-war settings.},

Title = {Participation in devolved commons management: Multiscale socioeconomic
   factors related to individuals' participation in community-based
   management of marine protected areas in Indonesia},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {61},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Management of common-pool natural resources is commonly implemented
   under institutional models promoting devolved decision-making, such as
   co-management and community-based management. Although participation of
   local people is critical to the success of devolved commons management,
   few studies have empirically investigated how individuals' participation
   is related to socioeconomic factors that operate at multiple scales.
   Here, we evaluated how individual- and community-scale factors were
   related to levels of individual participation in management of
   community-based marine protected areas in Indonesia. In addressing this
   aim, we drew on multiple bodies of literature on human behaviour from
   economics and social science, including the social-ecological systems
   framework from the literature on common-pool resources, the theory of
   planned behaviour from social psychology, and public goods games from
   behavioural economics. We found three key factors related to level of
   participation of local people: subjective norms, structural elements of
   social capital, and nested institutions. There was also suggestive
   evidence that participation was related to people's cooperative
   behavioural disposition, which we elicited using a public goods game.
   These results point to the importance of considering socioeconomic
   factors that operate at multiple scales when examining individual
   behaviour. Further, our study highlights the need to consider multiscale
   mechanisms other than those designed to appeal to self interested
   concerns, such as regulations and material incentives, which are
   typically employed in devolved commons management to encourage
   participation. Increased understanding of the factors related to
   participation could facilitate better targeting of investments aimed at
   encouraging cooperative management. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Uniting forest and livelihood outcomes? Analyzing external actor
   interventions in sustainable livelihoods in a community forest
   management context},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE COMMONS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {11},

Abstract = {External actor interventions in community forest management (CFM)
   attempt to support communities with developing forest institutions
   and/or improving their livelihoods portfolio. Common pool resource (CPR)
   scholars argue that forest institutions are required to prevent
   overharvesting of the forest resource stock (appropriation dilemma), and
   to encourage investment in its maintenance (provision dilemma). The
   sustainable livelihoods approach (SLA) has been widely used to analyse
   the influence of interventions on rural livelihoods portfolios. As
   interventions in CFM span the academic divide between CPR and SLA
   literatures, analysis of such interventions through either a CPR or SLA
   lens risks overlooking intervention activities, significant outcomes of
   the intervention, and the interplay between these outcomes. We propose
   here an analytical framework which combines CPR and SLA insights and
   ascertain its applicability by analysing interventions in a forest
   dependent community in Andhra Pradesh, India. We developed multiple
   indicators to measure the community's ability to deal with appropriation
   and provision dilemmas, and their livelihoods portfolio. Using data from
   forest plots, household questionnaires, focus group meetings and
   interviews, we analysed the intervention approaches, activities and
   outcomes. Our results show that a community's ability to deal with
   appropriation and provision dilemmas both affects, and is affected by
   its livelihoods portfolio. These intricate and dynamic interplays
   strongly influence the direct and indirect outcomes of intervention
   activities. Incorporating the synergy between the CPR and SLA
   perspectives in our analytical framework led us to a much more nuanced
   understanding of intervention approaches, activities and outcomes than
   would have otherwise been gained from a single perspective framework.},

Title = {Flexible water allocations and rotational delivery combined adapt
   irrigation systems to drought},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {23},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {Self-governing irrigation systems are integral to global food security
   and face serious problems under climate change. This is particularly
   true in areas expected to become more arid such as the Southwestern
   United States, where restrictive water rights are strictly enforced.
   Adaptations to these dual climatic and legal challenges include
   user-selected rules. In particular, during water shortage self-governing
   irrigation systems often change water allocations between members and
   rotate water delivery. However, it is unclear how these rules interact
   with each other as configurations and with contextual factors, such as
   the degree of water scarcity. It is also unclear how these rules
   influence outcomes between irrigators closer to the water source and
   those farther from it. How might different configurations of rules
   interact with water availability to produce outcomes along an irrigation
   system's canal network? This study addresses this question by exploiting
   a natural experiment in water distribution and allocation rules during
   shortage among a stratified sample of 60 snowmelt dependent irrigation
   systems in the San Luis Valley of Colorado during a four-year drought
   period from 2011-2014. A key finding is that the combination of
   rotational delivery and flexible water allocations produces the most
   equal crop growth between irrigators at the head and tail of the
   irrigation system at all levels of water availability. The marginal
   productivity of water at the head and tail end of irrigation systems at
   all levels of water availability is also equalized under this
   configuration. These results suggest a greater likelihood of ongoing
   collective action, important for climate change adaptation. However,
   rotation with flexible allocations is outperformed by other
   configurations depending on context. These findings highlight the
   configurational relationships between rules, further illustrate
   interactions between rules and physical context, and caution against
   panaceas in water resource management and climate change adaptation.},

Journal = {SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {112},
Number = {5-6},
Pages = {21-35},
Month = {MAY-JUN},
Abstract = {Stewardship is a popular term for the principles and actions aimed at
   improving sustainability and resilience of social-ecological systems at
   various scales and in different contexts. Participation in stewardship
   is voluntary, and is based on values of altruism and long-term benefits.
   At a global scale, `earth stewardship' is viewed as a successor to
   earlier natural resource management systems. However, in South Africa,
   stewardship is narrowly applied to biodiversity conservation agreements
   on private land. Using a broader definition of stewardship, we identify
   all potentially related schemes that may contribute to sustainability
   and conservation outcomes. Stewardship schemes and actors are
   represented as a social network and placed in a simple typology based on
   objectives, mechanisms of action and operational scales. The predominant
   type was biodiversity stewardship programmes. The main actors were
   environmental non-governmental organisations participating in prominent
   bioregional landscape partnerships, together acting as important `
   bridging organisations' within local stewardship networks. This bridging
   enables a high degree of collaboration between non-governmental and
   governmental bodies, especially provincial conservation agencies via
   mutual projects and conservation objectives. An unintended consequence
   may be that management accountability is relinquished or neglected by
   government because of inadequate implementation capacity. Other
   stewardship types, such as market-based and landscape initiatives,
   complemented primarily biodiversity ones, as part of national spatial
   conservation priorities. Not all schemes related to biodiversity,
   especially those involving common pool resources, markets and supply
   chains. Despite an apparent narrow biodiversity focus, there is evidence
   of diversification of scope to include more civic and community-level
   stewardship activities, in line with the earth stewardship metaphor.},

Title = {Collective action and the risk of ecosystem regime shifts: insights from
   a laboratory experiment},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {20},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Ecosystems can undergo regime shifts that potentially lead to a
   substantial decrease in the availability of provisioning ecosystem
   services. Recent research suggests that the frequency and intensity of
   regime shifts increase with growing anthropogenic pressure, so
   understanding the underlying social-ecological dynamics is crucial,
   particularly in contexts where livelihoods depend heavily on local
   ecosystem services. In such settings, ecosystem services are often
   derived from common-pool resources. The limited capacity to predict
   regime shifts is a major challenge for common-pool resource management,
   as well as for systematic empirical analysis of individual and group
   behavior, because of the need for extensive preshift and postshift data.
   Unsurprisingly, current knowledge is mostly based on theoretical models.
   We examine behavioral group responses to a latent endogenously driven
   regime shift in a laboratory experiment. If the group exploited the
   common-pool resource beyond a certain threshold level, its renewal rate
   dropped drastically. To determine how the risk of such a latent shift
   affects resource management and collective action, we compared four
   experimental treatments in which groups were faced with a latent shift
   with different probability levels (0.1, 0.5, 0.9, 1.0). Our results
   suggest that different probability levels do not make people more or
   less likely to exploit the resource beyond its critical potential
   threshold. However, when the likelihood of the latent shift is certain
   or high, people appear more prone to agree initially on a common
   exploitation strategy, which in turn is a predictor for averting the
   latent shift. Moreover, risk appears to have a positive effect on
   collective action, but the magnitude of this effect is influenced by how
   risk and probabilities are communicated and perceived.},

Abstract = {In the study of common-pool resource (CPR) governance, frameworks
   provide a metatheoretical language to describe system states, dynamics,
   elements, and relationships. The coding manuals which accompany CPR
   frame-works-in addition to providing guidelines for connecting empirical
   case work to conceptual variables-define a vocabulary of coding
   questions. For empirical work, connecting variables and coding questions
   with framework elements contributes to conceptual advance. In the
   process of analysis and publication, it is tempting to offer a novel
   framework without also developing, applying, or modifying the
   foundational questions and variables of coding manuals buttressing said
   frameworks. However, if the scholarly community is to generate robust
   knowledge for the study of CPR dilemmas, we must provide the underlying
   work of comparing across frameworks. In this paper, we report on one way
   the community might conduct such comparisons. We present results and
   challenges of using a group consensus process to link the more than 450
   coding questions derived from the original Institutional Analysis and
   Development Framework (IADF) to the recently proposed Coupled
   Infrastructure Systems Framework (CISF). Despite overlap, discrepancies
   in the conceptual positions of the IADF and CISF suggest a need to
   modify or create new coding variables related to concepts of system
   boundaries, externalities, cross-scale interactions,
   multi-functionality, and technological change. We suggest that such work
   needs provisioning if commons scholars are to navigate the continued
   challenges of tailoring frameworks and coding manuals to evolving CPR
   governance dilemmas.},

Title = {Contrasting perspectives on mangroves in arid Northwestern Mexico:
   Implications for integrated coastal management},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {54},
Number = {4},
Pages = {318-329},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Mangroves in Northwestern Mexico are vital to maintain coastal
   environments healthy, to provide nutrients for several food chains, and
   to supply valuable goods and services that sustain and improve human
   livelihoods. Many of these values offer a range of opportunities for
   economic development that attract workers, investors and developers.
   Recently, federal privatization policies have promoted an accelerated
   coastal development of this region to obtain large profits in short
   times, creating competing and overlapping interests to use coastal
   environments and control key resources. Such intense developments are
   modifying the ecological conditions of many coastal areas, threatening
   the provision of important ecosystem services to society. After years of
   centralized decisions, new paradigms are needed to achieve a coastal
   management that ensures long-term ecosystem maintenance, fair resource
   use and social equity. Recognizing the multiplicity of actors involved
   in coastal management and using a qualitative research methodology, we
   identified and explored the perspectives of different key stakeholders
   in the states of Baja California Sur and Sonora, Mexico, to better
   understand their views on mangroves use and management as well as the
   interaction among them. We discuss similarities and/or discrepancies
   found among stakeholders' perceptions by describing their central ideas
   and identifying overlapping interests that may create conflicts when
   defining development and conservation programs or formulating policies.
   This information also intends to encourage further research on the
   social-ecological system of the coasts in Northwestern Mexico and to
   contribute to address coastal management issues in integrated ways that
   consider the social dimension through documenting stakeholders'
   narratives in the future. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Distributed energy systems as common goods: Socio-political acceptance
   of renewables in intelligent microgrids},
Journal = {RENEWABLE \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {127},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The future social-technical system (STS) of power supply based on
   renewables depends heavily upon the rapid emergence of Distributed
   Energy Systems (DES). The prime object of Social Acceptance processes of
   renewable energy innovation becomes the issue of how to incorporate DES.
   The realization of this transformation requires the escape from
   locked-in hierarchy and standardized design of the centralized grid.
   This review elaborates the advanced conceptualization of Social
   Acceptance, particularly its socio-political layer. High diffusion of
   DES in intelligent microgrids leads to polycentricity replacing
   hierarchy. Therefore, the main object of `socio-political acceptance'
   concerns institutional changes replacing hierarchy by co-production
   within STSs applying DES. Renewables become `common goods' in such
   systems, instead of `private' or `public' goods. Systems providing
   `common goods' like renewables -that are natural resources-show
   similarities to socialecological systems, the self-governing entities in
   common pool resources theory. Application of this institutional theory
   to co-production in DES leads to the following conclusions on
   socio-political acceptance. Renewables generation, integration, storage,
   intelligence and demand response require a shift towards co-producing
   prosumers. Electricity as an economic good must be redefined from
   commercial private commodity delivered in a public grid towards a
   co-produced common good. Essential for common prosumer-based DES is the
   application of peer-to-peer deliverance (P2P). Policy must avoid to
   interfere in this and also should remove legal obstructions and
   transaction costs for P2P and coproduction. As space is the prime
   scarcity factor for DES, prosumers' communities should also be empowered
   in co-producing land use decisions for construction of their DES
   infrastructures.},

   Evidence from REDD plus in Vietnam},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {9},

Abstract = {The complex relationship between local development and current large
   scale investments in natural resources in the Global South for the
   purpose of conservation and carbon sequestration is not fully understood
   yet. The Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation
   programme (REDD+) is an example of such investment. This study examines
   the livelihood implications and perceptions of REDD+ among indigenous
   and forest-dependent communities in the Central Highlands of Vietnam. A
   systems-based livelihood survey has been conducted with two communities
   affected by REDD+ (n = 102)-Kala Tonggu village (participating in
   UN-REDD, a multilateral programme) and Hieu commune (participating in a
   REDD+ project of Fauna and Flora International). The positive effects of
   REDD+ included: introduction of community-based forest management;
   shifting power relations in favour of local communities; communities
   receiving financial benefits for forest monitoring; and positive
   community perceptions on REDD+. The negative impacts concerned: more
   restricted access to the natural forest; raising false expectations on
   the financial benefits of REDD+; increasing risks of food insecurity;
   exclusion of customary institutions and forest classifications; and lack
   of livelihood alternatives in dealing with changing socio-ecological
   conditions. Based on the findings of this study, we argue that REDD+
   implementation needs to incorporate the temporality and dynamics of
   community livelihoods, power relations, and customary and formal
   socio-ecological systems more comprehensively. This to ultimately
   achieve inclusive local development and effective conservation of global
   forest commons.},

Title = {Transcending Landscapes: Working Across Scales and Levels in Pastoralist
   Rangeland Governance},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {60},
Number = {2},
Pages = {185-199},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Landscape approaches can be subjected to mistakenly targeting a single
   ``best{''} level of governance, and paying too little attention to the
   role that cross-scale and cross-level interactions play in governance.
   In rangeland settings, resources, patterns of use of those resources,
   and the institutions for managing the resources exist at multiple levels
   and scales. While the scholarship on commons offers some guidance on how
   to conceptualize governance in rangeland landscapes, some elements of
   commons scholarship-notably the ``design principles{''} for effective
   governance of commons-do not seem to apply neatly to governance in
   pastoralist rangeland settings. This paper examines three cases where
   attempts have been made to foster effective landscape governance in such
   settings to consider how the materiality of commons influences the
   nature of cross-scale and cross-level interactions, and how these
   interactions affect governance. In all three cases, although external
   actors seemed to work appropriately and effectively at community and
   landscape levels, landscape governance mechanisms have been facing great
   challenges arising from relationships beyond the landscape, both
   vertically to higher levels of decision-making and horizontally to
   communities normally residing in other landscapes. The cases demonstrate
   that fostering effective landscape-level governance cannot be
   accomplished only through action at the landscape level; it is a task
   that must be pursued at multiple levels and in relation to the
   connections across scales and levels. The paper suggests elements of a
   conceptual framework for understanding cross-level and cross-scale
   elements of landscape governance, and offers suggestions for governance
   design in pastoralist rangeland settings.},

Title = {Defining Success in the Commons: Addressing Problem Orientations,
   Multidimensionality, Norms, and Tradeoffs},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE COMMONS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {14},
Number = {1},
Pages = {366-387},
Abstract = {Commons and social-ecological systems research examines institutional
   arrangements for governing natural resources to improve social and
   ecological outcomes. However, no universal definition of success exists.
   We examine the CPR and SES synthesis literature to identify trends, gaps
   and challenges for examining success. We address: (1) gaps in the
   literature, (2) multidimensionality and tradeoffs, and (3) and the link
   between problem orientation and definitions of success. To do this we
   conduct a comprehensive review of Large-N studies, meta-analyses and
   systematic reviews of CPR and SES governance (n = 45). We found seven
   dimensions of success, corresponding to collective choice,
   constitutional and operational levels, temporal dimensions, and
   socio-economic outcomes. Most studies did not address power and
   tradeoffs, or specify the social groups to whom success would apply. The
   majority of studies defined success in one dimension, most often
   demand-side provisioning (e.g., productivity or biodiversity). A
   regression analysis suggests that studies on rangelands or grasslands,
   correlative studies, and/or studies of state property systems (i.e.,
   protected areas) were more likely to use fewer dimensions of success.
   Problem orientations often did not correlate with dimensions of success
   considered in a study, suggesting that measures of success often cannot
   adequately address the full suite of problems recognized in synthesis
   research. This presents a significant challenge for collective action
   among scholars who aim to develop general knowledge on SES and CPR
   governance. We discuss exemplary studies that measure success as
   multidimensional, address power and tradeoffs, and conclude with four
   recommendations for advancing the analysis of success.},

Title = {Some fundamental elements for studying social-ecological co-existence in
   forest common pool resources},
Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Month = {FEB 27},
Abstract = {For millennia, societies have tried to find ways to sustain people's
   livelihoods by setting rules to equitably and sustainably access,
   harvest and manage common pools of resources (CPR) that are productive
   and rich in species. But what are the elements that explain historical
   successes and failures? Elinor Ostrom suggested that it depends on at
   least eight axiomatic principles of good governance, whereas empirical
   results suggest that these principles are not sufficient to describe
   them, especially when applied to CPRs that possess great social and
   ecological diversity. The aim of this article is to explore the behavior
   of a mathematical model of multi-species forest dynamics that respects
   the foundations of ecology and Ostrom's governance theory, in order to
   detect possible constraints inherent to the functioning of these complex
   systems. The model reveals that fundamental structural laws of
   compatibilities between species life-history traits are indeed
   constraining the level of co-existence (average and variance) between a
   diversity of co-vulnerable timber resource users (RU) and of competing
   tree species. These structural constraints can also lead to unexpected
   outcomes. For instance in wetter forest commons, opening up the access
   to as many diverse RUs as there are competing tree species, produces a
   diversity of independently-controlled disturbances on species,
   collectively improving the chances of coexistence between species with
   different life-history traits. Similar benefits are observed on forest
   carbon and on profits from timber harvesting. However in drier forest
   commons, the same benefits cannot be observed, as predicted on the basis
   of the constraining laws. The results show that the successes and
   failures of certain management strategies can be reasonably explained by
   simple mechanistic theories from ecology and the social-ecological
   sciences, which are themselves constrained by fundamental ecological
   invariants. If corroborated, the results could be used, in conjunction
   with Ostrom's CPR theory, to understand and solve various human-nature
   coexistence dilemmas in complex social-ecological systems.},

Title = {Local fishery, global commodity: the role of institutions in mediating
   intersectoral conflict, cooperation, and competition in a globalized
   fishery},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {18},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {Commons scholarship has improved our understanding of how to govern
   resources for sustainability. However, it has also been critiqued for
   its focus on traits (e.g. well-defined system boundaries) that are
   increasingly threatened by social and environmental trends. Fisheries
   are a key example of this challenge. While small-scale fisheries are
   critically important to the diets and livelihoods of millions,
   industrial fisheries from developed countries now dominate fishing
   around the world. While these two systems are governed separately, there
   is substantial overlap between them, conceptualized as the growing
   influence of globalization on local common pool resource (CPR) systems.
   One of the most impactful, but least understood consequences of this
   convergence are the emerging conflicts and competition between
   small-scale and industrial fisheries. In these systems, the interaction
   between small-scale CPRs and globalized commodity chains has meant the
   creation of a new, hybrid resource system, addressed by neither
   conventional industrial nor traditional small-scale governance
   approaches. We use empirical data from 396 cases of interactions at sea
   between globalized industrial and local small-scale fishers in Ghana
   from 1984 to 2013 to examine the conditions under which resource users
   conflict or cooperate, linking them to broader political and economic
   dynamics across scales. We consider the institutional factors that
   mediate these interactions, identifying policies to promote cooperative,
   and avert conflictual incidents. We further consider the long-term
   effects of these patterns of conflict and cooperation for the resilience
   or vulnerability of the resource base, the fishers, and the institutions
   governing the system. We suggest that specific governance arrangements
   that reduce disparities between groups, promote bridging social capital,
   and enhance hybrid and cross-scale institutions offer the best potential
   to govern resource systems where traditional CPRs and market-oriented
   industries converge.},

Year = {2019},
Volume = {143},

Abstract = {While increasing consensus has grown around the important role of
   monitoring in environmental resource governance, little is known about
   under what conditions people would rather pay private costs to implement
   monitoring and punishment. Using field survey data on communities and
   households from four suburb areas in China, this paper employs
   Institutional Analysis and Development framework to empirically examine
   households' willingness and actual activities on waste disposal
   monitoring. The empirical results show that population density,
   community modernization, and being male significantly increase the
   likelihood of households supervising waste disposal while community size
   and heterogeneity of wealth and ethnicity seriously impede the
   involvement of households in waste disposal supervision. More
   importantly, our estimation results reveal that staffing community with
   full-time cadres for sanitation management suppress the enthusiasm of
   households in conducting waste disposal supervision, but stock of social
   capital and peer monitoring substantially increase the intention to
   supervise waste disposal and the possibility of households engaging in
   waste disposal supervision activities. In addition, social norms,
   household income, and householder age are primary predictors of the
   intention-behavior gap between hypothetical willingness to monitor and
   actual monitoring behavior. Therefore, improving community
   infrastructure and economic condition, reducing external intervention on
   community affairs, and cultivating social capital stock are important
   approaches to enhance public participation in environmental governance.},

Title = {Positive Social-Ecological Feedbacks in Community-Based Conservation},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},
Month = {MAY 26},
Abstract = {Marine area-based conservation measures including no-take zones (areas
   with no fishing allowed) are often designed through lengthy processes
   that aim to optimize for ecological and social objectives. Their (semi)
   permanence generates high stakes in what seems like a one-shot game. In
   this paper, we theoretically and empirically explore a model of
   short-term area-based conservation that prioritizes adaptive
   co-management: temporary areas closed to fishing, designed by the
   fishers they affect, approved by the government, and adapted every 5
   years. In this model, no-take zones are adapted through learning and
   trust-building between fishers and government fisheries scientists. We
   use integrated social-ecological theory and a case study of a network of
   such fisheries closures ({''}fishing refugia{''}) in northwest Mexico to
   hypothesize a feedback loop between trust, design, and ecological
   outcomes. We argue that, with temporary and adaptive area-based
   management, social and ecological outcomes can be mutually reinforcing
   as long as initial designs are ecologically ``good enough{''} and
   supported in the social-ecological context. This type of adaptive
   management also has the potential to adapt to climate change and other
   social-ecological changes. This feedback loop also predicts the
   dangerous possibility that low trust among stakeholders may lead to poor
   design, lack of ecological benefits, eroding confidence in the tool's
   capacity, shrinking size, and even lower likelihood of social-ecological
   benefits. In our case, however, this did not occur, despite poor
   ecological design of some areas, likely due to buffering by social
   network effects and alternative benefits. We discuss both the potential
   and the danger of temporary area-based conservation measures as a
   learning tool for adaptive co-management and commoning.},

Title = {Coping with Dismantling Forces: Traditional Management and
   Transformations of Szekely-Hungarian Village Commons of Transylvania, in
   the 16-21th Centuries},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE COMMONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Pages = {278-294},
Abstract = {The Szekelyfold region of Transylvania, Romania is a unique
   social-ecological system and a traditional farming landscape with rich
   biological and cultural diversity. Commons institutions have ancient
   roots here, and are still prevalent today. In this paper, we attempt to
   give an overview of the traditional organisation, accelerating
   challenges, transformations and reorganisations of the Szekely commons
   over their history based on existing literature, covering the interval
   between the 16th and 21th centuries. Based on this overview, we also
   identify key drivers for resilience that counteracted dismantling
   forces, to account for the long persistence and transformability of
   these institutions. We found that between the end of the 16th and the
   mid-19th centuries, Szekely commons showed remarkable stability in their
   functioning based on village bylaws, and these documents also
   demonstrate that most communities could be characterised by Ostrom's
   design principles in this period. From the 19th century, the pressures
   of state centralisation, market integration, new technologies,
   population growth, polarisation and changing values intensified,
   creating significant dismantling forces. However. Szekely commons
   survived, and we argue that the harsh mountainous environment and
   isolation, coupled with locally rooted identity, worldview and a rich
   institutional memory, and also the traditional notions of equity and the
   widespread availability of common resources constituted elements of
   resilience, which helped to prevent dissolution. We conclude that as
   direct human-nature links lie at the heart of many of the identified
   drivers for resilience, nurturing these links seems essential for the
   survival of traditional local institutions and management practices that
   maintain biological and cultural diversity in a globalised world.},

Title = {Building adaptive capacity in a coastal region experiencing global
   change},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {25},
Number = {3},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Coastal ecosystems in the eastern U.S. have been severely altered by
   human development, and climate change and other stressors are now
   further degrading the capacity of those ecological and social systems to
   remain resilient in the face of such disturbances. We sought to identify
   potential ways in which local conservation interests in the Lowcountry
   of South Carolina (USA) could participate in a social process of
   adaptation planning, and how that process might ultimately be broadened
   to engage a more diverse set of partners. We engaged participants
   through a combination of informal meetings, workshops, and other
   collaborative interactions to explore how the conservation community
   perceives and pursues its various missions, and how that community might
   confront the threats and opportunities in its future. Coproduction of
   knowledge and meaning were facilitated by collaborative scenario
   planning and strategic planning evaluation, which illuminated how the
   conservation community is integral to the broader governance of the
   region and highlighted how responses to forces of change are mediated
   through local culture, economics, and politics. We suggest an
   interpretation of conservation in which the fundamental objectives of
   both social and ecological systems might be prioritized in tandem,
   rather than narrowly focusing on environmental protection without
   consideration of the social landscape. Ultimately, adaptive capacity
   depends on the ability to act collectively, and social capital, trust,
   and organization greatly influence the capacity to act. Thus, we
   conclude that the presence of strong social networks, coordination and
   deliberation among diverse stakeholders, mechanisms for experiential
   feedback, and emphasis on social learning are key elements needed to
   build adaptive capacity. Central to the evolving perspective of
   governance of the commons is recognition that social and ecological
   systems are coupled; the issues and problems of one cannot be addressed
   without considering the consequences for the other. Moreover, a dominant
   theme emerging from our research and that of other scholars is the
   importance of culture and place attachment, which generates social
   cohesion and facilitates problem solving. These ideas have important
   implications for when, where, and how stakeholders are engaged to
   address the rapid changes being experienced by social-ecological
   systems.},

Title = {Local ecological knowledge and institutional dynamics for ecosystem

Abstract = {The sustainable use of resources requires that management practices and
   institutions take into account the dynamics of the ecosystem. In this
   paper, we explore the role of local ecological knowledge and show how it
   is used in management practices by a local fishing association in a
   contemporary rural Swedish community. We focus on the local management
   of crapfish, a common-pool resource, and also address the way crapfish
   management is linked to institutions at different levels of Swedish
   society, Methods from the social sciences were used for information
   gathering, and the results were analyzed within the framework of
   esosystem management. We found that the practices of local fishing
   association resemble an ecosystem approach to crayfish management. Our
   results indicate that local users have substantial knowledge of resource
   and ecosystem dynamics from the level of the individual crayfish to that
   of the watershed, as reflected in a variety of interrelated management
   practices embedded in and influenced by institutions at several levels.
   We propose that this policy of monitoring at several levels
   simultaneously, together with the interpretation of a bundle of
   indicators and associated management responses, enhances the possibility
   of building ecological resilience into the watershed. Furthermore, we
   found that flexibility and adaptation are required to avoid
   command-and-control pathways of resource management. We were able to
   trace the development of the local fishing association as a response to
   crisis, followed by the creation of an opportunity for reorganization
   and the recognition of slow ecosystem structuring variables, and also to
   define the role of knowledgeable individuals in the whole process. We
   discuss the key roles of adaptive capacity, institutional learning, and
   institutional memory for successful ecosystem management and conclude
   that scientific adaptive management could benefit from a more explicit
   collaboration with flexible community-based systems of resource
   management for the implementation of policies as experiments.},

Title = {Changes in community perspectives on the roles and rules of church
   forests in northern Ethiopia: evidence from a panel survey of four
   Ethiopian Orthodox communities},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE COMMONS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Pages = {355-387},
Abstract = {Some of the only Afromontane forest in northern Ethiopia today is on
   lands managed by followers of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, where for
   centuries priests and communities have conserved forest groves around
   church buildings. The ecological value of the thousands of church
   forests in Ethiopia has been widely acknowledged, but little is known
   about the diverse local institutions that govern these resources, or how
   such institutions might be changing in response to Ethiopia's rapid
   recent economic development. This study uses a unique panel survey to
   explore changes in community perspectives on the social and ecological
   roles of church forests, and rules governing church forest use, in four
   Orthodox communities over time. Our sample consists of 122 household
   surveys conducted in 2002 and a further 122 surveys from 2014, with 71
   households interviewed in both periods. We find that reported uses of
   church forests vary across forests and over time, with larger forests
   more likely to be used for extractive purposes such as firewood and
   construction timber, while smaller forests have become more restricted
   to renewable or non-extractive uses such as natural medicines, honey,
   and prayer. Results of logistic regression suggest church followers'
   support for preserving church forests increases with age and access to
   alternative sources of firewood - including exotic Eucalyptus spp.
   plantations which are increasingly widespread in northern Ethiopia. We
   also observe a shift since 2002 away from an expectation that church
   followers themselves hold responsibility for rule enforcement in church
   forests to a perceived sharing of responsibility by church authorities
   (i.e. priests) and government (i. e. police) in 2014. Together the
   progressive introduction of exotic tree species in church forests
   combined with the erosion of religious norms surrounding local forest
   governance may threaten the integrity and diversity of these unique
   social-ecological systems.},

Title = {Ecological interdependencies and resource competition: The role of
   information and communication in promoting effective collaboration in
   complex management situations},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {14},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC 17},
Abstract = {Communication between resource users has repeatedly been shown to be of
   significant importance in environmental management. The proposed causal
   mechanisms are numerous, ranging from the ability of users to share
   information to their ability to negotiate solutions to common problems
   and dilemmas. However, what is less known is under what conditions these
   potential causal mechanisms are important and if, in cases when
   different means other than communication were available, whether they
   would be more effective in accomplishing these objectives. An example of
   such an alternative could be that instead of (or in addition to) users
   being reliant on within-group communication to acquire useful
   information an intermediary-such as a public agency-could provide that
   for them. Furthermore, the different causal mechanisms making
   communication beneficial might not be independent, neither in respect to
   each other, nor in respect to other externally imposed means to
   facilitate better environmental management, and not in regards to
   different contextual factors. This study makes use of laboratory
   experiments in an innovative way to explore these questions and
   specifically test the relative importance of communication in managing
   complex social-ecological system characterized by common-pool resource
   dilemmas, ecological interdependencies, and asymmetric resource
   access-all characteristics being present simultaneously. We find that
   when resources users are confronted with such a complex challenge, the
   ability to communicate significantly increases individual and group
   performance. What is more surprising is the negative effect on overall
   outcomes that providing external information has on outcomes, when the
   users also have the ability to communicate. By analysing the content of
   the conversations we are able to suggest several possible explanations
   on how the combination of external information provisioning and user
   communications act to increase individual cognitive load and drives
   intra-group competition, leading to a significant reduction of
   individual and group outcomes.},

Title = {Sustaining the Commons: The Coercive to Cooperative, Resilient, and

Journal = {JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN PLANNING ASSOCIATION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {82},
Number = {4},
Pages = {327-349},
Month = {FAL},
Abstract = {Problem, research strategy, and findings: States need guidance to adopt
   comprehensive water planning legislation that can affect urban planning
   and built form. Current state legislation, however, may not yet
   incorporate emerging water resource paradigms that promote sustainable
   water management at the state and substate levels. Planners can improve
   existing state legislation, but need guidance on incorporating the
   latest thinking on resilience, adaptive capacity, and sustainable
   commons management. I identify the 26 states with comprehensive water
   planning legislation, and analyze that legislation using a new
   assessment tool that builds on the coercive versus cooperative metric
   (CvCA). I determine where each state's water planning legislation falls
   on a coercive versus cooperative spectrum, and the extent to which each
   state's legislation incorporates sustainable commons management (SCM)
   and social-ecological resilience (SER) mechanisms and attributes. Most
   of the 26 states with comprehensive water planning legislation balance
   coercive and cooperative approaches to achieve state and substate water
   plans, although research suggests that planning is most effective when
   legislation is more cooperative. Moreover, most have not codified SCM
   and SER mechanisms into state water planning legislation, suggesting
   that the plans that follow may lack the adaptive capacity to increase
   the resilience of the water system. Research limitations include the
   single data source and potential interpretive coding bias.Takeaway for
   practice: Planners can advocate for new or improved state water
   legislation that incorporates integral adaptive and resiliency concepts,
   encouraging states to include the fundamental features of the
   social-ecological system that lead to better water management.},

Title = {The role of institutions in community wildlife conservation in Zimbabwe},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE COMMONS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Pages = {134-169},
Abstract = {Institutions play a significant role in stabilising large-scale
   cooperation in common pool resource management. Without restrictions to
   govern human behaviour, most natural resources are vulnerable to
   overexploitation. This study used a sample size of 336 households and
   community-level data from 30 communities around Gonarezhou National Park
   in Zimbabwe, to analyse the relationship between institutions and
   biodiversity outcomes in community-based wildlife conservation. Our
   results suggest a much stronger effect of institutions on biodiversity
   outcomes via the intermediacy of cooperation. Overall, the performance
   of most communities was below the desired level of institutional
   attributes that matter for conservation. Good institutions are an
   important ingredient for cooperation in the respective communities.
   Disaggregating the metric measure of institutions into its components
   shows that governance, monitoring and enforcement are more important for
   increased cooperation, while fairness of institutions seems to work
   against cooperation. Cooperation increases with trust and group size,
   and is also higher in communities that have endogenised punishment as
   opposed to communities that still rely on external enforcement of rules
   and regulations. Cooperation declines as we move from communal areas
   into the resettlement schemes and with increasing size of the resource
   system. A very strong positive relationship exists between cooperation
   and biodiversity outcomes implying that communities with elevated levels
   of cooperation are associated with a healthy wildlife population.
   Biodiversity outcomes are more successful in communities that either
   received wildlife management training, share information or those that
   are located far away from urban areas and are not very close to the
   boundary of the game park. Erecting an electric fence, the household
   head's age, the number of years in school and number of years living in
   the area negatively affect biodiversity outcomes. One policy implication
   of this study is to increase autonomy in CAMPFIRE communities so that
   they are able to invest in good institutions, which allows them to
   self-organise and to manage wildlife sustainably.},

Title = {Competition between wild and honey bees: Floral resources as a common
   good providing multiple ecosystem services},
Journal = {ECOSYSTEM SERVICES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {62},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {It is increasingly acknowledged that bees are declining, notably as a
   result of global changes such as climate and land-use changes that
   affect the abundance and diversity of floral resources (i.e. pollen and
   nectar). Recently, a new concern has gained traction: the negative
   impact of honeybees on wild bees due to competition over floral
   resources. Some studies also suggest that there might be intraspecific
   competition among honeybees themselves. While these issues have mainly
   been considered by ecological scientists so far, this study aims to
   address their social dimensions as well. We suggest that viewing floral
   resources as common-pool resources could pave the way to new governance
   mechanisms for their management, based on collective action involving
   the multiple actors that use and modify these floral resources and the
   associated ecosystem services. Combining conceptual insights on
   common-pool resources, collective action and ecosystem services, we
   develop a conceptual model of human-bee-flower social-ecological
   systems. This model was applied in a case study in the Ce \&
   PRIME;vennes National Park, to analyse beekeepers' representations,
   practices, rules-in-use and social interactions, allowing us to identify
   critical levers and obstacles for collective governance of floral
   resources. Our analysis reveals that although there are diverse and
   controversial perceptions of floral resources and competition among
   bees, the idea of viewing floral resources as a common-pool resource
   underlies a range of practices and rules-in-use. In addition, we show
   that beekeepers' perceptions are changing due to the increasing
   vulnerability of floral resources. All in all, considering floral
   resources as a common-pool resource appears a relevant way to study the
   social interdependencies involved in their management. It is now crucial
   to develop new forms of governance of floral resources that will
   reconcile beekeeping and the conservation of wild bees, in coordination
   with farmers and other land managers.},

Title = {Applying the social-ecological system framework to the diagnosis of
   urban lake commons in Bangalore, India},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {19},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {The south Indian city of Bangalore provides a challenging yet
   representative context within which to examine issues of governance of
   urban social-ecological commons. The city was once famous for its
   numerous large water bodies, which have witnessed tremendous
   encroachment and pollution in recent years. These water bodies, called
   tanks or lakes, were typically managed by adjacent village communities
   but are now administered by a number of government departments involved
   with aspects of lake management, with multiple overlapping
   jurisdictions. The public's perceptions of lakes has also changed with
   urbanization, transitioning from community spaces valued for water and
   cultural services to urban recreational spaces used largely by joggers
   and walkers. We focus on a set of seven lakes located in the urbanizing
   peripheral areas of southeast Bangalore. Some water bodies have been
   restored and managed effectively by newly forged collaborations between
   citizens and local government. Others are extremely polluted, and some
   have completely dried up and have been encroached. We use a
   social-ecological system (SES) framework to investigate why some
   locations have been successful in negotiating changes in governance from
   community-based systems to state management following urbanization,
   whereas other lakes have deteriorated. We use seven second-tier SES
   variables that were associated with self-organization in previous
   research: size of resource system, number of actors, leadership, social
   capital, importance of resource, existence of operational-choice rules,
   and existence of informal mechanisms for monitoring. We also include
   three third-tier variables previously identified as important in urban
   lake commons in Bangalore: scale and type of pre-existing pollution,
   exclusion of socioeconomic groups from the planning process, and
   networking with government organizations. We use this subset of 10
   variables to examine social outcomes of the lakes, which we define as
   the extent of collective action by residents working together for lake
   restoration and ecological outcomes based on the ecological condition of
   the lakes. Collective action was low in only one of seven lakes, which
   challenges the presumption that citizens will not organize efforts to
   cope with common-pool problems. However, only two of seven lakes were
   highly successful in regard to both the extent of collective action and
   the level of ecological performance. While one lake was small and the
   other moderate in size, these two cases shared similar ranking in all
   other variables. Both lakes were polluted at a relatively low level
   compared with the other lakes, and in both cases, the leaders of local
   groups were able to network with government officials to clean up the
   lakes. Unfortunately, the challenge of cleaning up urban lakes after
   many decades of pollution is very difficult without effective
   interaction with various governmental units. Our analysis illustrates
   the usefulness of the SES framework in examining the combination of
   variables that makes a collective difference in affecting the outcomes
   of collective action and ecological performance. Our findings illustrate
   the need for polycentric arrangements in urban areas, whereby local
   residents are able to organize in diverse ways that reflect their own
   problems and capabilities, but can also work jointly with larger-scale
   governments to solve technical problems requiring changes in major
   engineering works as well as acquiring good scientific information.
   Such arrangements can reduce transaction costs for city governments by
   actively engaging local communities in processes that include
   coordination of collective activities, design of inclusive and locally
   suited ecological and social restoration goals, and planning and
   enforcement of regulations limiting access and withdrawal. At a time
   when many city governments are facing financial and administrative
   challenges that limit their ability to regulate and maintain urban
   commons, models of public-community partnerships could provide more
   inclusive, equitable, and sustainable institutional alternatives. This
   is an aspect that needs significant further consideration because the
   attention of most urban planners and scholars has remained on
   privatization while studies of successful instances of cooperative
   action in the urban context remain few and far between.},

Title = {Traditional Mobile Pastoralism in a Contemporary Semiarid Rangeland in

Abstract = {Pastoral systems are regarded as complex social-ecological systems with
   components that interact and change over a range of spatial and temporal
   scales. As such, herd mobility has traditionally been used to respond to
   the dynamic nature of these systems. However, mobile pastoral systems
   around the world are becoming more constrained and increasingly
   fragmented with important implications for herd mobility. This study
   assessed the spatial distribution of 256 herds and their mobility
   patterns over a decade in the 10 villages that comprise the spatially
   constrained Leliefontein pastoral area in South Africa. We developed a
   hierarchical model of rangeland use, which showed that several
   stratified and connected socioeconomic, climatic, and environmental
   factors determined the spatial and temporal use of grazing areas in this
   192 000-ha semiarid environment. At the highest level of use, access to
   the Leliefontein pastoral area is formally regulated. At the next level,
   the place of residence of herd owners largely defined which village
   commons was used by their livestock. At the third level of rangeland
   use, the wealth status of owners determined where in relation to human
   settlements their herds were located. At the lowest level in the
   hierarchy, the locations of water and croplands delineated seasonal
   grazing areas and the movement of stockposts. These stratified factors,
   together with the overall variability in grazing resource availability
   and the different decision making processes involved, resulted in high
   flexibility and diversity of herd mobility patterns at the lowest level
   of rangeland use. This, in turn, ensured heterogeneity in resource use
   over a range of spatial and temporal scales. It was concluded that
   policies should embrace the complexity of the pastoral system and enable
   the adaptive management of herds. This could reduce the level of
   vulnerability experienced by pastoralists to climate variability and
   wider societal change. (C) 2018 The Society for Range Management.

Title = {Food security in the face of climate change: Adaptive capacity of

Abstract = {Improving the adaptive capacity of small-scale irrigation systems to the
   impacts of climate change is crucial for food security in Asia. This
   study analyzes the capacity of small-scale irrigation systems dependent
   on the Asian monsoon to adapt to variability in river discharge caused
   by climate change. Our study is motivated by the Pumpa irrigation
   system, a small-scale irrigation system located in Nepal that is a model
   for this type of system. We developed an agent-based model in which we
   simulated the decisions farmers make about the irrigation strategy to
   use according to available water flow. Given the uncertainty associated
   with how climate change may affect the Asian monsoon, we simulated the
   performance of the system under different projections of climate change
   in the region (increase and decrease in rainfall, reduction and
   expansion of the monsoon season, and changes in the timing of the onset
   of the monsoon). Accordingly to our simulations, farmers might need to
   adapt to rainfall intensification and a late onset in the monsoon
   season. The demands for collective action among farmers (e.g.
   infrastructure repair, meetings, decisions, etc.) might increase
   considerably due to climate change. Although our model suggests that
   investment in new infrastructure might increase the performance of the
   system under some climate change scenarios, the high inequality among
   farmers when water availability is reduced might hinder the efficiency
   of these measures due to a reduction of farmers' willingness to
   cooperate. Our modeling exercise helps to hypothesize about the most
   sensitive climate change scenarios for smallscale irrigation farming in
   Nepal and helps to frame a discussion of some possible solutions and
   fundamental trade-offs in the process of adaptation to improve for food
   and water security under climate change. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier

Title = {Machine learning to analyze the social-ecological impacts of natural
   resource policy: insights from community forest management in the Indian
   Himalaya},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {14},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Machine learning promises to advance analysis of the social and
   ecological impacts of forest and other natural resource policies around
   the world. However, realizing this promise requires addressing a number
   of challenges characteristic of the forest sector. Forests are complex
   social-ecological systems (SESs) with myriad interactions and feedbacks
   potentially linked to policy impacts. This complexity makes it hard for
   machine learning methods to distinguish between significant causal
   relationships and random fluctuations due to noise. In this context, SES
   frameworks together with quasi-experimental impact evaluation approaches
   can facilitate the use of machine learning by providing guidance on the
   choice of variables while reducing bias in estimated effects. Here we
   combine an SES framework, optimal matching, and Causal Tree-based
   algorithms to examine causal impacts of two community forest management
   policies (forest cooperatives and joint state-community partnerships) on
   vegetation growth in the Indian Himalaya. We find that neither policy
   had a major impact on average, but there was important heterogeneity in
   effects conditional on local contextual conditions. For joint forest
   management, a set of biophysical and climate factors shaped differential
   policy impacts across the study region. By contrast, cooperative forest
   management performed much better in locations where existing
   grazing-based livelihoods were safeguarded. Stronger local institutions
   and secure tenure under cooperative management explain the difference in
   outcomes between the two policies. Despite their potential, machine
   learning approaches do have limitations, including absence of valid
   precision estimates for heterogeneity estimates and issues of estimate
   stability. Therefore, they should be viewed as a complement to impact
   evaluation approaches that, among other potential uses, can uncover key
   drivers of heterogeneity and generate new questions and hypotheses to
   improve knowledge and policy relating to forest and other natural
   resource governance challenges.},

Title = {Transitions of social-ecological subsistence systems in the Arctic},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE COMMONS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Pages = {275-329},
Abstract = {Transitions of social-ecological systems (SES) expose governance systems
   to new challenges. This is particularly so in the Arctic where resource
   systems are increasingly subjected to global warming, industrial
   development and globalization which subsequently alter the local SES
   dynamics. Based on common-pool resource theory, we developed a dynamic
   conceptual model explaining how exogenous drivers might alter a
   traditional subsistence system from a provisioning to an appropriation
   actions situation. In a provisioning action situation the resource users
   do not control the resource level but adapt to the fluctuating
   availability of resources, and the collective challenge revolve around
   securing the subsistence in the community. An increased harvest pressure
   enabled by exogenous drivers could transform the SES to an appropriation
   action situation where the collective challenge has changed to avoid
   overuse of a common-pool resource. The model was used as a focal lens to
   investigate the premises for broad-scale transitions of
   subsistence-oriented SESs in Arctic Alaska, Canada and Greenland. We
   synthesized data from documents, official statistics and grey and
   scientific literature to explore the different components of our model.
   Our synthesis suggests that the traditional Arctic subsistence SESs
   mostly comply with a provisioning action situation. Despite population
   growth and available technology; urbanization, increased wage labor and
   importation of food have reduced the resource demand, and we find no
   evidence for a broad-scale transition to an appropriation action
   situation throughout the Western Arctic. However, appropriation
   challenges have emerged in some cases either as a consequence of
   commercialization of the resource or by severely reduced resource stocks
   due to various exogenous drivers. Future transitions of SESs could be
   triggered by the emergence of commercial local food markets and Arctic
   warming. In particular, Arctic warming is an intensifying exogenous
   driver that is threatening many important Arctic wildlife resources
   inflicting increased appropriation challenges to the governance of local
   harvest.},

Title = {Integrating societal perspectives and values for improved stewardship of
   a coastal ecosystem engineer},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {19},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {Oyster reefs provide coastal societies with a vast array of ecosystem
   services, but are also destructively harvested as an economically and
   culturally important fishery resource, exemplifying a complex
   social-ecological system (SES). Historically, societal demand for
   oysters has led to destructive and unsustainable levels of harvest,
   which coupled with multiple other stressors has placed oyster reefs
   among the most globally imperiled coastal habitats. However, more recent
   studies have demonstrated that large-scale restoration is possible and
   that healthy oyster populations can be sustained with effective
   governance and stewardship. However, both of these require significant
   societal support or financial investment. In our study, we explored
   relationships among how coastal societies (1) perceive and value oyster
   ecosystem services, (2) recognize and define problems associated with
   oyster decline, and (3) perceive or support stewardship initiatives. We
   specifically focused on the SES of eastern oysters (Crassostrea
   virginica) and coastal societies in the northern Gulf of Mexico, a
   region identified as offering among the last and best opportunities to
   sustainably balance conservation objectives with a wild fishery. We
   found that, in addition to harvest-related benefits, oysters were highly
   valued for providing habitat, mitigating shoreline erosion, and
   improving water quality or clarity. Our results also showed that
   although most respondents recognized that oyster populations have
   declined, many respondents characterized the problem differently than
   most scientific literature does. Among a variety of initiatives for
   enhancing sustainability, spawning sanctuaries and reef restoration were
   well supported in all states, but support for harvest reductions was
   less consistent. Our study suggests that public support for maintaining
   both harvest and ecosystem services exists at societal levels and that
   enhancing public awareness regarding the extent and causes of oyster
   decline could garner additional support for stewardship initiatives.
   Collectively, the societal, economic, and biophysical complexities of
   the northern Gulf of Mexico oyster SES illustrate the need and public
   support for developing more comprehensive management schemes for
   exploited ecosystem engineers.},

Title = {An Agent-Based Model of Public Participation in Sustainability
   Management},

Year = {2014},

Abstract = {This article reports on an agent-based simulation of public
   participation in decision making about sustainability management. Agents
   were modeled as socially intelligent actors who communicate using a
   system of symbols. The goal of the simulation was for agents to reach
   consensus about which situations in their regional environment to change
   and which ones not to change as part of a geodesign process for
   improving water quality in the greater Puget Sound region. As opposed to
   studying self-organizing behavior at the scale of a local `commons', our
   interest was in how online technology supports the self-organizing
   behavior of agents distributed over a wide regional area, like a
   watershed or river basin. Geographically-distributed agents interacted
   through an online platform similar to that used in online field
   experiments with actual human subjects. We used a factorial research
   design to vary three interdependent factors each with three different
   levels. The three factors included 1) the social and geographic
   distribution of agents (local, regional, international levels), 2)
   abundance of agents (low, medium, high levels), and 3) diversity of
   preconceptions (blank slate, clone, social actor levels). We expected
   that increasing the social and geographic distribution of agents and the
   diversity of their preconceptions would have a significant impact on
   agent consensus about which situations to change and which ones not to
   change. However, our expectations were not met by our findings, which we
   trace all the way back to our conceptual model and a theoretical gap in
   sustainability science. The theory of self-organizing resource users
   does not specify how a group of social actors' preconceptions about a
   situation is interdependent with their social and geographic orientation
   to that situation. We discuss the results of the experiment and conclude
   with prospects for research on the social and geographic dimensions of
   self-organizing behavior in social-ecological systems spanning wide
   regional areas.},

Title = {Stewardship of urban ecosystem services: understanding the value(s) of
   urban gardens in Barcelona},
Journal = {LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {170},
Pages = {79-89},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The notion and assessment of ecosystem services (ES) values is becoming
   an established part of the discourse regarding urban green space
   performance. Yet, underlying factors enabling ES values are still poorly
   understood. We assume the production of ES value crucial for
   environmental stewardship in cities, and aimed in this study to uncover
   their key enabling factors. This study has been developed on a broad
   data base including a survey (n = 201), interviews (n = 46), field
   observation and remote sensing from 27 urban gardens in Barcelona,
   Spain, including municipal `allotment gardens' and `civic gardens'
   emerging from bottom-up initiatives. In a first step, we distinguished
   different urban gardens types regarding the ES values they provide. In a
   second step, we tested specific garden characteristics including (a)
   user profiles, (b) biophysical garden properties, and (c) institutional
   settings for their specific importance to trigger ES values. Results
   showed ES values to significantly differ with the types of gardens. For
   example, classical allotment gardens are more likely to provide
   recreational values, while emerging civic gardens are more likely to
   produce place-making and social cohesion. A main finding from our study
   is the importance of social and institutional garden characteristic as
   enabling factors of ES values. Results indicate, for example, a
   correlation between childhood experiences and a higher appreciation of
   ES. Our results further indicate that civic gardens with broader
   property rights and decision-capacities are more likely to enhance
   stewardship action. In providing a differentiated understanding of the
   ES value(s) of urban gardens, this study highlights the potential for
   green space planning in cities to steer the stewardship of urban gardens
   by providing institutional and physical space for civic gardening
   initiatives.},

Title = {Factors influencing sustainability of traditional village groves<i>
   (Maeulsoop)</i> in Korea},
Journal = {FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {128},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {This study examines the sustainability of traditional village groves
   (Maeulsoop), forest commons, in South Korea, and investigates factors
   influencing their sustainability. We assessed the socio-economic
   functions and ecological conditions of twenty-four village groves in
   Namwon City, South Korea, and evaluated the sustainability of these
   village groves. Variables (ownership, self-governance, forest size and
   location, and village population) were selected based on the
   social-ecological systems framework, and the influence of these
   variables on the sustainability of village groves was examined. Out of
   the twenty-four village groves studied, three (12.5\%) turned out to be
   sustainable with the socio-economic functions maintained and in a
   healthy state, eight (33.3\%) were unsustainable with some of
   socio-economic functions lost and in an unhealthy state, and thirteen
   (54.2\%) were in a tradeoff state between socio-economic functions and
   ecological health. Positive relationships between sustainability and the
   ownership of village groves and the existence of a self-governing
   management body in villages were observed. This result suggests that
   when villages own their groves and/or villages have the self-governance,
   village groves tend to be more sustainable. In addition, forest size,
   village population, and distance to village center are correlated to the
   sustainability of village groves. Larger village groves still play a
   role as a windbreak or flood bank and are more ecologically resilient
   than smaller groves. Depopulation has led to a lack of labor force that
   can manage village groves, and village groves located far from villages
   are less accessible for use by villagers, and thus can be left and
   neglected without proper monitoring and management. Considering the
   recent trend of rural depopulation and privatization of commons, this
   study suggests that collaborations among villages and organizations
   outside villages are necessary to restore the governance systems and
   sustainably manage village groves.},

Title = {Functional silos and other governance challenges of rangeland management
   in Iceland},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {105},
Pages = {37-46},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Social-ecological system (SES) promoting sustainable management of
   natural resources in common ownership are steered by a complex
   governance system that includes regulations through laws and policies,
   and management by administrative authorities operating across
   multi-level institutional structures that, in turn, are shaped by
   stakeholder interests. In addition, the long-term progress of natural
   resource management not only relies upon the existence of a
   well-structured and functional governance system, but needs that system
   to adaptably facilitate sustainable resource management in line with
   current knowledge and best practices.
   In this research we mapped the administrative structure that steers
   rangeland management in Iceland and undertook a critical analysis of the
   governance system's structure and functions to examine if agricultural
   and environmental policy targets have facilitated improved rangeland
   management practices. A survey, based on a questionnaire distributed to
   selected public sector employees and sheep farmers, was used to gauge
   the participants: a) attitude towards rangeland management practices, b)
   perception of the level of collaboration and state support for rangeland
   restoration and c) views on current agricultural and environmental
   policies on rangeland management.
   The results strongly indicate that neither the current administrative
   structure nor the governance process itself have significantly
   facilitated expected attitude changes within the agricultural sector or
   among local authorities. Furthermore, it has neither facilitated
   significant attitude nor behavioral changes among sheep farmers aimed at
   improved rangeland management, in line with current government
   agricultural and environmental policy targets. Our key findings support
   previous research that shows the governance system for rangeland
   management in Iceland as structurally limited and suffering from weak
   vertically and horizontally integration. Furthermore, our findings
   clearly reveal the need for improved governance for rangeland management
   and the need for increased levels of knowledge application within the
   system.},

Title = {The commons institution of Antarctica: a roadmap to governance of
   mankind resources},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PROPERTY PLANNING AND ENVIRONMENTAL LAW},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {165-184},
Month = {AUG 17},
Abstract = {Purpose - This paper aims to draw on Ostrom's commons theory to analyse
   the governance regime of Antarctic as a commons institution. Antarctic
   is a peculiar territorial space on Earth, which due to its unique
   characteristics constitutes a global common resource that very much
   resembles outer space resources. On these grounds, the paper highlights
   successful, and less successful, arrangements developed in the Antarctic
   commons to be considered as a blueprint or roadmap towards the
   governance of outer space resources as a commons.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper uses first, the
   social-ecological system (SES) framework to outline the characteristics
   of Antarctic as a commons institution, and second, Ostrom's design
   principles to assess the commons institution of Antarctic. The Antarctic
   commons institution is used next, as an analogy to reflect on the
   challenges outer space global resource face and the way it could be
   managed.
   Findings - The paper concludes that Antarctic enjoys a functional,
   credible and successful commons institution that should reinforce the
   twofold governance structure it exhibits. Similar cases of global common
   resources, such as these of outer space, that seek to establish a
   similar commons institution should take into account issues related the
   benefits spectrum and the credible commitment of actors to engage in
   different levels of the governance regime. What matters is not
   necessarily the form of the regime but rather how the commons as an
   institution functions, whether it fulfils the needs and interests of the
   driving actors and, on these grounds, how credible these arrangements
   are in the eyes of the committed members.
   Research limitations/implications - Both Antarctica and outer space are
   rather unique cases and domains of multiple resources.
   Practical implications - The paper provides an analogy to consider
   sustainable appropriation of global resources ({''}global commons{''})
   for peace and prosperity to all.
   Originality/value - The paper is original, in the sense that according
   to the best of the authors' knowledge, no published work has identified
   Antarctic as a commons institution or has used the aforementioned
   methodologies to analyse Antarctica as a commons and to employ their
   findings in providing directions for the design of appropriate
   governance frameworks for other resources that exhibit the
   characteristics of global commons, such as these of the outer space.},

Title = {Open property and complex mosaics: variants in tenure regimes across
   pastoralist social-ecological systems},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE COMMONS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {804-826},
Abstract = {While it has repeatedly been observed that pastoralist resource
   governance systems tend not to conform to the assumptions and principles
   of mainstream scholarship on property rights and governance of commons,
   coherent theoretical reasons why this is the case are less common. One
   exception is the concept of open property regimes. This view holds that
   the quintessential features of dryland pastoralist systems - limited and
   highly variable rainfall, low resource density, mobility, and
   institutions and norms that emphasize flexibility and access - can
   result in pastoralist herders dynamically distributing and
   redistributing themselves across a territory without the assumed benefit
   of clear boundaries or of collective decision-making and rules. However,
   the open property regimes explanation describes some pastoralist systems
   better than others. This paper argues that some pastoralist systems are
   neither conventional commons nor open property regimes. Instead they
   tend to reflect another model, referred to here as a complex mosaic
   regime, in which there is gradation of strength and clarity of
   exclusionary property rights over different resources, in which property
   rights are often unbundled and allocated to different actors and
   governance mechanisms, and in which a prominent role is played by social
   processes and governance mechanisms other than property rights
   institutions. Social and biophysical characteristics that may be more
   conducive to complex mosaic regimes than to open property systems,
   particularly if all of those characteristics are found together, include
   a severe and chronic shortage of one or more critical resources, spatial
   heterogeneity of resources, scalar heterogeneity of interests, and a
   herd mobility pattern that involves occasional convergence on highly
   valued key resource areas. In elaborating the complex mosaic regime
   model, this paper addresses a blind spot in scholarship on property
   rights and commons, deepening the understanding of why pastoralist
   systems tend not to conform to mainstream theory, as well as helping to
   explain some of the differences among pastoralist systems. Understanding
   the internal logic of alternative resource governance regime models and
   the social-ecological conditions that make one model more viable than
   another can help to guide national policies and the strategies of
   conservation and development actors.},

Title = {Coordinating community resource use and conservation: An institutional
   diagnostic practice in the Wuyishan National Park},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {317},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Maintaining community resource use and securing ecosystem services for
   the public is a major issue in protected area management. This research
   developed an institutional diagnostic tool for community resource use
   based on the theories of ``Common-Pool Resources{''}, ``Environment
   Entitlement{''} and ``Socio-ecological System{''}. This tool is maturing
   and tested in the Wuyishan National Park through a knowledge
   co-production process of communities' narratives and researchers'
   observations. It was used to identify key institutional factors that
   affect communities' ecosystem management, facilitate a negotiation
   procedure that can motivate communities' acceptance of new rules and
   participation in conservation, and provide policy entry points for
   sustaining both the ecosystem and rural livelihoods. Results show that
   key factors affecting resource accessibility mainly include land policy
   at the macro scale, protected area planning and management at the
   meso-scale, and the internalising of modern regulations and technologies
   with historical inheritance at the micro-scale. Key institutions
   affecting access to ecosystem services and well-being include mainly the
   formal institutions such as the market and credit system at the
   meso-scale, and informal institutions expressed by collective actions at
   the micro-scale. Results also indicate that local people mainly cared
   about the procedural legitimacy and their environmental autonomy for
   negotiation in the multi-stakeholder context. They required a reasonable
   and clear definition of resource use regulation, and low risks to join
   in a negotiation. By integrating the key institutions and negotiation
   demands, we provided the policy entry point to facilitate the
   institutional change in Wuyishan National Park. This diagnostic tool is
   proved applicable in the way of knowledge co-production, and it is
   promising to help formulate context specific conservation policies to
   facilitate the community to participate in the construction and
   management of protected areas for win-win outcomes of the natural
   ecosystem and community welfare.},

Abstract = {This paper aims to characterize the role of relational capital as a key
   for collective decision-making processes in water management within a
   rural community (Santa Rosa) near the Mexico-Texas borderland.
   Relational capital, also known as social capital, is concerned with the
   resources that individuals, community groups, institutions and
   organizations derive from their participation in networks and
   associations for social change. In particular, commons-based social
   organization models are becoming increasingly important to social policy
   practitioners to engage with communities and enable them to better use
   community assets for development. In this context, this paper is aiming
   to dive into a thorough literature review in which Resilience, and Rural
   Resilience in particular is defined as the capacity of a system to
   absorb shocks and disturbances, while still maintaining the same
   functions, structure and feedbacks (Walker and Pearson, 2007). Hence,
   this piece of work focuses on the notion of Rural Resilience as a means
   of community survival under challenging conditions (Weick et al., 1999).
   By adopting a grounded theory model, developed by Glover (2012), this
   piece of research will apply four categories of analysis embedded in the
   Rural Resilience concept (Glover, 2012:360): Strategies, Learning,
   Resources Used and Innovation for Santa Rosa ` s case, a community whose
   land revels in the existence of natural resources such as water and
   shale gas but multiple stakeholder interests threaten them. It is
   thought that the adjustment on government policies about water, energy
   and sustainability creates new scenarios for the local decision-makers.
   This scope and methodology could shed some light on Santa Rosa
   community's social mechanisms to find a set of strategies that allow a
   better interaction to endure change as part of their reality. Indeed,
   some rural community resilience strategies could develop governance
   capabilities in the case of the Mexico-Texas borderland region. By
   presenting a summary of recent literature on social capital in
   communities and a regional case study, this paper presentation will aim
   to reflect on the role of low/high levels of social capital nodes in
   order to foster key capabilities and networks amongst some of the
   Mexico-Texas borderland emerging and conscientious rural citizens.},

Title = {Best response dynamics improve sustainability and equity outcomes in
   common-pool resources problems, compared to imitation dynamics},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {509},
Month = {JAN 21},
Abstract = {Shared resource extraction among profit-seeking individuals involves a
   tension between individual benefit and the collective well-being
   represented by the persistence of the resource. Many game theoretic
   models explore this scenario, but these models tend to assume either
   best response dynamics (where individuals instantly switch to better
   paying strategies) or imitation dynamics (where individuals copy
   successful strategies from neighbours), and do not systematically
   compare predictions under the two assumptions. Here we propose an
   iterated game on a social network with payoff functions that depend on
   the state of the resource. Agents harvest the resource, and the strategy
   composition of the population evolves until an equilibrium is reached.
   The system is then repeatedly perturbed and allowed to re-equilibrate.
   We compare model predictions under best response and imitation dynamics.
   Compared to imitation dynamics, best response dynamics increase
   sustainability of the system, the persistence of cooperation while
   decreasing inequality and debt corresponding to the Gini index in the
   agents' cumulative payoffs. Additionally, for best response dynamics,
   the number of strategy switches before equilibrium fits a power-law
   distribution under a subset of the parameter space, suggesting the
   system is in a state of self-organized criticality. We find little
   variation in most mean results over different network topologies;
   however, there is significant variation in the distributions of the raw
   data, equality of payoff, clustering of like strategies and power-law
   fit. We suggest the primary mechanisms driving the difference in
   sustainability between the two strategy update rules to be the
   clustering of like strategies as well as the time delay imposed by an
   imitation processes. Given the strikingly different outcomes for best
   response versus imitation dynamics for common-pool resource systems, our
   results suggest that modellers should choose strategy update rules that
   best represent decision-making in their study systems. (C) 2020 Elsevier

Title = {Pacific Canada's Rockfish Conservation Areas: using Ostrom's design
   principles to assess management effectiveness},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {20},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {International declines in marine biodiversity have lead to the creation
   of marine protected areas and fishery reserve systems. In Canada, 164
   Rockfish Conservation Areas (RCAs) were implemented between 2003 and
   2007 and now cover 4847.2 km(2) of ocean. These reserves were created in
   response to widespread concern from fishers and nongovernmental
   organizations about inshore rockfish (genus Sebastes) population
   declines. We used the design principles for effective common-pool
   resource management systems, originally developed by Elinor Ostrom, to
   assess the social and ecological effectiveness of these conservation
   areas more than 10 years after their initial implementation. We assessed
   the relative presence or absence of each design principle within current
   RCA management. We found that 2 of the 11 design principles were
   moderately present in the recreational fishery. All other design
   principles were lacking for the recreational sector. We found that 2
   design principles were fully present and 5 were moderately present in
   the commercial sector. Four design principles were lacking in the
   commercial sector. Based on this analysis, we highlight 4 main areas for
   management improvement: (1) create an education and outreach campaign to
   explain RCA rules, regulations, boundaries, and the need for marine
   conservation; (2) increase monitoring of users and resources to
   discourage noncompliance and gather the necessary data to create social
   buy-in for marine conservation; (3) encourage informal nested governance
   through stakeholder organizations for education and self-regulation
   (e.g. fisher to fisher); and (4) most importantly, create a formal,
   decadal RCA review process to gather stakeholder input and make
   amendments to regulations and RCA boundaries. This information can be
   used to inform spatial management systems both in Canada and
   internationally. This analysis also contributes to a growing literature
   on effectively scaling up small-scale management techniques for
   large-scale, often federally run, common-pool resource systems.},

Title = {Compelling collective action: Does a shared pollution cap incentivize
   farmer cooperation to restore water quality?},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE COMMONS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {378-399},
Abstract = {Decades of voluntary efforts to reduce agricultural nonpoint source
   pollution have been ineffective at protecting water quality worldwide.
   While farmer collective action is needed to deal with the geographical
   extent of diffuse pollution from nutrient runoff, theoretical
   expectations from commons governance research predicts that farmers will
   not protect water quality since they have few incentives to do so. These
   different factors indicate that compulsory approaches are needed.
   However, the commons literature has tended to overlook the constructive
   roles that government regulation can play. Research on why farmers adopt
   on-farm conservation measures similarly has failed to explore farmer
   cooperation, instead focusing mainly on financial motivations of
   farmers. Yet, some adoption research indicates that social norms are
   essential factors shaping (non) adoption, but which are largely
   overlooked by existing agri-environmental policies. This study examines
   the important gap of how government regulations can incentivise
   farmer-cooperation to improve water quality. I focus on a case study of
   the Florida Everglades, where farmers face joint liability under a
   phosphorus pollution cap and which has resulted in improvements in water
   quality over the past 20 years. Farms' drainage disrupts the
   oligotrophic conditions of the Florida Everglades, but water quality has
   steadily improved since regulations began in 1994. However, the
   regulations set compliance jointly for farmers, devolving responsibility
   to ensure sufficient adoption of conservation practices and deal with
   free riding. While state monitoring shows that collectively farms have
   improved water quality, we do not know whether participation is
   widespread or concentrated among a few large farms. This study provides
   the first analysis of farm-level water quality outcomes for this area
   and how judicial, legislative, and local institutions interact to
   encourage farmer cooperation. Results show that a large majority of
   farms have improved their water quality, demonstrating that collective
   action has been a key element in the outcome. At the same time,
   poor-performing farms reveal the shortcomings of joint compliance. I end
   by discussing the implications of how individual and collective
   requirements can provide farmers with valuable information while also
   drawing on farmer social dynamics to encourage greater participation.},

Title = {Collective action components of low-cost housing: an empirical analysis
   using Ostrom's SES framework},
Journal = {PROPERTY MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {40},
Number = {3},
Pages = {388-408},
Month = {MAY 24},
Abstract = {Purpose To date, low-cost housing held under the common-property regime
   is faced with various collective action or management issues in relation
   to common facilities. Understanding and unpacking key collective action
   components in a multi-dimensional and systematic fashion that help
   explain the status quo of the complex low-cost housing management is
   crucial, particularly in identifying potential factors contributing to
   the suboptimal self-governing outcome. Therefore, the purpose of this
   paper is to investigate the collective action of low-cost housing in
   Malaysia using Ostrom's institutional analysis development and
   social-ecological system framework (IAD-SES framework) as a theoretical
   framework. Design/methodology/approach First, a mixed-method research
   design was adopted where issues relating to the management of common
   properties of low-cost housing were identified in the Malaysian context.
   Second, the components of Ostrom's IAD framework relevant to collective
   action were identified. Third, after interviewing six experts in the
   housing industry via semi-structured interviews, two more components
   (historical development/adaptability to new environment and ethnicity)
   were added to the questionnaire survey. From here, 633 respondents who
   lived in four low-cost housings in Kuala Lumpur from 1,598 households
   were surveyed in 2012. We then merged the IAD framework with the SES
   framework. Factor analysis and Cronbach's alpha analysis were conducted
   to uncover the underlying variables and the social ecological clusters
   that they belonged. Findings With average Cronbach's alpha of 0.83, the
   seven key SES components identified are able to cumulatively explain
   71\% variance of local collective action components. Based on the
   cumulative percentage explained, the top five key SES components are as
   follows: context (social, economic and political settings); ethnicity;
   outcome; resource system; and users characteristics. Originality/value
   This study identifies key components related to the collective action

Title = {An Ecosystem Services Perspective for the Oceanic Eastern Tropical
   Pacific: Commercial Fisheries, Carbon Storage, Recreational Fishing, and
   Biodiversity},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {3},
Abstract = {The ocean provides ecosystem services (ES) that support humanity.
   Traditional single-issue management largely failed to protect the full
   suite of ES. Ecosystem-based management (EBM) promotes resilient
   social-ecological systems that provide ES. To implement EBM, an ES
   approach is useful: (1) characterize major ES provided (magnitude,
   geographic extent, monetary value, trends, and stakeholders), (2)
   identify trade-offs, (3) determine desired outcomes, and (4) manage
   anthropogenic activities accordingly. Here we apply the ES approach
   (steps 1-2) to an open ocean ecosystem, the eastern tropical Pacific
   (ETP), an area of 21 million km 2 that includes waters of 12 nations and
   the oceanic commons, using 35 years (1975-2010) of fisheries and
   economic data, and 20 years (1986-2006) of ship-based survey data. We
   examined commercial fisheries, carbon storage, recreational fishing, and
   biodiversity as the major provisioning, regulating, cultural, and
   supporting ES, respectively. Average catch value (using U.S. import
   prices for fish) for the 10 most commercially fished species was \$2.7
   billion yr(-1). The value of carbon export to the deep ocean was \$12.9
   billion yr(-1) (using average European carbon market prices). For two
   fisheries-depleted dolphin populations, the potential value of
   rebuilding carbon stores was \$1.6 million (cumulative); for exploited
   fish stocks it was also \$1.6 million (an estimated reduction of 544,000
   mt). Sport fishing expenditures totaled \$1.2 billion yr(-1), from
   studies of three popular destinations. These initial, conservative
   estimates do not represent a complete summary of ETP ES values. We
   produced species richness maps for cetaceans, seabirds, and
   ichthyoplankton, and a sightings density map for marine turtles. Over
   1/3 of cetacean, seabird, and marine turtle species occur in the ETP,
   and diversity (or density) hotspots are widespread. This study fills
   several gaps in the assessment of marine and coastal ES by focusing on
   an oceanic habitat, utilizing long-term datasets, mapping the spatial
   distribution of ecological components, and concentrating on an area
   beyond Europe and the USA. Our results improve our understanding of ETP
   ES, highlight their variety, and offer a new perspective for a
   fisheries-dominated system. This study sets the stage for further
   analyses of trade-offs, which can inform decisions about resource
   management and biodiversity conservation.},

Title = {Managing Marine Protected Areas in Remote Areas: The Case of the
   Subantarctic Heard and McDonald Islands},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {6},
Month = {OCT 11},
Abstract = {Large marine protected areas (MPAs) are increasingly being established
   to contribute to global conservation targets but present an immense
   challenge for managers as they seek to govern human interactions with
   the environment over a vast geographical expanse. These challenges are
   further compounded by the remote location of some MPAs, which magnify
   the costs of management activities. However, large size and remoteness
   alone may be insufficient to achieve conservation outcomes in the
   absence of critical management functions such as environmental
   monitoring and enforcement. The Australian subantarctic Heard Island and
   McDonald Islands (HIMI) Marine Reserve is among the world's most remote
   MPAs with notoriously harsh oceanographic conditions, and yet the
   region's rich mammal and fish resources have been exploited
   intermittently since the mid-1800s. More recently, the development of
   lucrative international markets for Patagonian toothfish, sold as
   Chilean seabass, led to the growth in both legal and illegal fishing. In
   2002, to conserve the unique ecology and biodiversity in the area,
   Australia declared a 65,000 km2 MPA around HIMI. Worldwide, government
   agencies have, however, struggled to develop cost-effective
   institutional arrangements for conservation. This paper therefore draws
   upon the social-ecological systems meta-analysis database (SESMAD) to
   characterize the structure of conservation governance and outcomes in
   the HIMI Marine Reserve. The Marine Reserve has generally been
   successful in supporting a sustainable fishery while addressing threats
   to biodiversity. The remote and isolated nature of the Marine Reserve
   was critical to its success, but also benefited greatly from
   collaborations between managers and the fishing industry. Commercial
   fishers keep watch over the Reserve while fishing, report any
   observations of illegal fishing (none since 2006/07), and have at times
   been asked to verify remote observation of potential illegal fishing
   vessels. The industry also undertakes annual ecological surveys in the
   MPA, allowing managers to track environmental trends. The fishing
   industry itself highlights the importance of industry participation in
   conservation planning, strengthened by secure access to resources via
   statutory fishing rights, which provide critical incentives to invest in
   conservation. We therefore reflect on the potential application of this
   case to other remote large MPAs, highlighting potential directions for
   future research.},

Abstract = {Over the past 50 years, both financing and socioeconomic considerations
   in South India have shifted heavily towards improving urban
   infrastructure, causing rural services to be left behind. A recent
   report released by WHO and UNICEF states that over 884 million people,
   84\% of whom live in rural areas, use ``unimproved water sources{''} for
   domestic purposes. This paper considers the case study of Nalgonda, a
   district to the east of Hyderabad, India. Nalgonda struggles with three
   main issues concerning domestic water: high fluoride levels in
   groundwater have caused thousands of cases of dental and skeletal
   fluorosis; second, over two-thirds of Nalgonda does not meet the
   WHO-requirement of 40 liters per capita daily of domestic water supply;
   third, poor management and maintenance have increased the risk of
   failure of existing water infrastructure. The state has been pursuing
   these issues in conjunction with a multi-district irrigation project
   that taps the regional Nagarjuna Sagar Dam. Centralized water supply,
   treatment, and distribution services are appropriate for high population
   density areas; however, geographical expanse and sparse populations lead
   to onerous access to improved water sources and inhibit the success of a
   similar centralized framework in rural areas. This is compounded by a
   lack of ownership at the habitation and socio-cultural levels. Further,
   the current water network and its problems-including inconsistent
   service, corruption, and general distrust of the treated Sagar
   water-have emboldened wealthier citizens to build private, unregulated
   groundwater defluoridation plants and commercialize small-scale water
   businesses.
   Inequitable services and uncertainty of shared water resources have
   caused a ``tragedy of the commons,{''} leading to growing disparity and
   a severely receding water table. This research proposes the Louis-Ostrom
   Comprehensive Capacity Assessment (LOCCA) tool-an integration of the
   quantitative Capacity Factors Analysis risk methodology and the
   qualitative Ostrom's framework for assessing socio-ecological systems
   (SESs). The new framework is used to provide a sample assessment of the
   Vaillapally habitation in Narayanpur Mandal, Nalgonda. Preliminary
   results indicate that the institutional, technical, and socio-cultural
   capacity factors must progress to meet the policymakers' current
   projects technical capacity. Alternatively, decentralized systems, such
   as rainwater harvesting technology, better serve rural areas with low
   capacity and demand, while increasing collective investment in
   village-scale systems.},

Title = {Markets and misfits in adaptive water governance: how agricultural
   markets shape water conflict and cooperation},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {27},
Number = {4},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Agricultural trade poses dilemmas for adaptive water governance as
   farmers and irrigation systems become integrated into global food value
   chains and are affected by their ongoing dynamics. The benefits and
   risks of agricultural trade and agrarian transitions are unevenly
   distributed, giving rise to complex interdependencies and externalities.
   Despite these growing linkages, the understanding of agricultural
   markets and their influence on water conflict and cooperation remains
   limited and dependent on context, which can lead to seemingly
   contradictory evidence. Progress has been hampered by boundary problems,
   disputed concepts, measurement issues, and divergent normative
   perspectives. Addressing these challenges will require that water
   governance scholars account more explicitly for agricultural trade when
   diagnosing collective action problems and assessing different modes of
   adaptive water governance. Drawing on the common-pool resource
   governance literature, we distinguish three separate, but interrelated,
   conceptual perspectives examining agricultural trade as an external
   factor in water governance: (1) market integration as a disturbance, (2)
   market integration as an opportunity, and (3) agricultural trade as a
   form of telecoupling with nested externalities. We compare these
   perspectives in terms of the externalities involved, their major claims
   about the relationship between market integration and collective action
   in the context of irrigation governance, and the broader implications
   for adaptive water governance. The comparison demonstrates the
   prevalence of institutional misfits and the common struggle of boundary
   shifting, i.e., matching water governance to the expanding problem-shed
   associated with agricultural markets. Institutional fit offers one
   important lens through which to consider the shifting boundaries (and
   actors) relevant for water governance, the scope and limits for
   strengthening fit through social learning, and the importance of nested
   governance to address nested externalities. These insights point the way
   for an agenda of research that examines the evolution of agricultural
   trade and adaptive water governance and pays explicit attention to the
   politics and power relations that shape who wins and loses and the
   different levers and entry points to improve management of the
   associated transitions and trade-offs. We conclude by arguing that
   future research should identify and examine pathways of adaptive water
   governance that strengthen processes of social learning and
   institutional nesting to address the external pressures and
   opportunities created by global food value chains.},
