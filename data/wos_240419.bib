abstract={Seagrass ecosystems are diminishing worldwide and repeated studies confirm a lack of appreciation for the value of these systems. In order to highlight their value we provide the first discussion of seagrass meadows as a coupled social-ecological system on a global scale. We consider the impact of a declining resource on people, including those for whom seagrass meadows are utilised for income generation and a source of food security through fisheries support. Case studies from across the globe are used to demonstrate the intricate relationship between seagrass meadows and people that highlight the multi-functional role of seagrasses in human wellbeing. While each case underscores unique issues, these examples simultaneously reveal social-ecological coupling that transcends cultural and geographical boundaries. We conclude that understanding seagrass meadows as a coupled social-ecological system is crucial in carving pathways for social and ecological resilience in light of current patterns of local to global environmental change.

abstract={Ostrom proposed the underpinnings of a framework for the systematic study of the governance of complex social-ecological systems. Here we hypothesize that Ostrom's social-ecological system framework can be useful to build a classification system for small-scale benthic fisheries, regarding their governance processes and outcomes. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to knowledge accumulation of benthic fisheries. To tailor the framework, we relied on discussions among experts and a systematic literature review of benthic fisheries from 1980 to 2010. This literature review helped us refine variable definitions and provide readers with illustrative reference papers. We then illustrate the approach and its potential contributions through two studies of the emergence of self-organization in Mexico and Chile. We highlight synthetic lessons from the cases and the overall approach as well as reflect on remaining challenges to the development of a social-ecological system framework as a diagnostic tool for knowledge accumulation and synthesis.

year={2013},
volume={52},
number={6},
pages={1355-1368},
month={DEC},
abstract={Marine protected areas are not established in an institutional and governance vacuum and managers should pay attention to the wider social-ecological system in which they are immersed. This article examines Islas Choros-Damas Marine Reserve, a small marine protected area located in a highly productive and biologically diverse coastal marine ecosystem in northern Chile, and the interactions between human, institutional, and ecological dimensions beyond those existing within its boundaries. Through documents analysis, surveys, and interviews, we described marine reserve implementation (governing system) and the social and natural ecosystem-to-be-governed. We analyzed the interactions and the connections between the marine reserve and other spatially explicit conservation and/or management measures existing in the area and influencing management outcomes and governance. A top-down approach with poor stakeholder involvement characterized the implementation process. The marine reserve is highly connected with other spatially explicit measures and with a wider social-ecological system through various ecological processes and socio-economic interactions. Current institutional interactions with positive effects on the management and governance are scarce, although several potential interactions may be developed. For the study area, any management action must recognize interferences from outside conditions and consider some of them (e.g., ecotourism management) as cross-cutting actions for the entire social-ecological system. We consider that institutional interactions and the development of social networks are opportunities to any collective effort aiming to improve governance of Islas Choros-Damas marine reserve. Communication of connections and interactions between marine protected areas and the wider social-ecological system (as described in this study) is proposed as a strategy to improve stakeholder participation in Chilean marine protected areas.},

abstract={Innovations in social-ecological research require novel approaches to conceive change in human-environment systems. The study of history constitutes an important element of this process. First, using the Chilika Lagoon small-scale fisheries in India, as a case, in this paper I reflect on the appropriateness of a social-ecological perspective for understanding economic history. Second, I examine here how changes in various components of the lagoon's social-ecological system influenced and shaped economic history and the political processes surrounding it. I then discuss the two-way linkages between economic history and social-ecological processes to highlight that the components of a social-ecological system, including the economic aspects, follow an interactive and interdependent trajectory such that their combined impacts have important implications for human-environment connections and sustainability of the system as a whole. Social, ecological, economic, and political components of a system are interlinked and may jointly contribute to the shaping of specific histories. Based on this synthesis, I offer insights to move beyond theoretical, methodological, and disciplinary boundaries as an overarching approach, an inclusive lens, to study change in complex social-ecological systems.},

abstract={Under appropriate conditions, community-based fisheries management can support sound resource stewardship, with positive social and environmental outcomes. Evaluating indigenous peoples' involvement in commercial sea cucumber and geoduck fisheries on the central coast of British Columbia, Canada, we found that the current social-ecological system configuration is relatively ecologically sustainable according to stock assessments. However, the current system also results in perceived inequities in decision-making processes, harvesting allocations, and socioeconomic benefits. As a result, local coastal resource managers envision a transformation of sea cucumber and geoduck fisheries governance and management institutions. We assessed the potential robustness of the proposed institutions using Elinor Ostrom's common-pool resource design principles. Grounded in the region's legal, political, and historical context, our analysis suggests that greater local involvement in these invertebrate fisheries and their management could provide more benefits to local communities than the status quo while maintaining an ecologically sustainable resource. Our research highlights the importance of explicitly addressing historical context and equity considerations in social-ecological system analyses and when renegotiating the institutions governing common-pool resources.},

title={Resource degradation, marginalization, and poverty in small-scale fisheries: threats to social- ecological resilience in India and Brazil},
journal={ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
year={2014},
volume={19},
number={2},
pages={NA},
month={NA},
abstract={In this study we examine poverty in local fisheries using a social-ecological resilience lens. In assessing why `` fishery may rhyme with poverty{''}, Christophe B n suggests a typology of impoverishment processes, which includes economic exclusion, social marginalization, class exploitation, and political disempowerment as key mechanisms that accelerate poverty. We extend his analysis by exploring these four mechanisms further and by intertwining them with processes of environmental change and degradation. Our goal is to understand poverty in local fisheries as a process rooted in social and institutional factors as influenced by ecological dynamics. We argue that understanding poverty will require a focus on the social-ecological system (SES) as a whole, and addressing poverty will mean rebuilding not only collapsed stocks but the entire social-ecological system, including restoring relationships between resources and people. Information from two cases, the Chilika Lagoon on the Bay of Bengal in India, and the Paraty region on the southeastern coast of Brazil, is used to understand how fishery social-ecological systems come under pressure from drivers at multiple levels, resulting in a range of impacts and pushing the system to a breaking point or collapse. We analyze elements of what it takes for the whole system to break down or collapse and push fishers into poverty and marginalization. The Chilika SES has already broken down, and the Paraty SES is under pressure from multiple drivers of change. The two cases help contrast key dynamics in the social, cultural, economic, political, and environmental spheres, for lessons on system collapse and recovery. Rebuilding fisheries may be examined as a process of building and strengthening resilience. The challenge is to make the fishery social-ecological system more resilient, with more flexibility and options, not only within fishing activities but also within a range of other sectors.},

abstract={Effective management of recreational fishing requires understanding fishers and their actions. These actions constitute critical links between social and ecological systems that result in outcomes that feedback and influence recreational fishers' actions and the management of these actions. Although much research exists on recreational fishers and their actions, this research is often disconnected from management issues. One way to help to overcome this disconnect is to illustrate how past research on the social component of recreational fishing fits within an emerging coupled social-ecological system (SES) framework. Herein, a conceptual SES is first developed with specific attention to recreational fisheries. This SES is then used to illustrate the importance of considering human dimensions research for articulating, studying and ultimately managing key outcomes of recreational fisheries (e.g. fish population conservation, fisher well-being) using the example of harvest regulations and a brief review of past interdisciplinary research on recreational fishing. The article ends by identifying key research needs including understanding: how factors such as management rules affect the diversity of actions by recreational fishers; how governance and management approaches adapt to changing social and resource conditions; and how recreational fishers learn and share information.},

abstract={In this essay, we explore the idea that slow social change may cause degradation of the open access equilibrium in recreational fisheries. An existing bioeconomic model illustrates how three social quantities in the recreational fisheries social-ecological system-the marginal cost of fishing effort, catchability, and the relative importance of catch and effort to angler utility-influence equilibrium fish abundance. We speculate that slow directional changes in all three of these quantities may be common, driving gradual declines in abundance that may be difficult to detect. We present limited evidence in support of this speculation, highlight the need for further empirical work, and discuss the implications of slow social change for resilient management of recreational fisheries in a changing world.},

abstract={Ecosystem-based Fisheries Management is a holistic management approach that integrates the dynamics of an entire ecosystem, including societal dimensions. However, this approach seldom lives up to its promise because economic and social objectives are rarely specified. To fill this gap, we explored how an ecosystem model could better integrate economic and social objectives, using the coral reef ecosystem around Hawai`i as a case study. After meeting with stakeholders and conducting a literature review of policy/strategy documents, we identified societal and ecological objectives and associated performance indicators for which data existed. We developed a social-ecological system conceptual framework to illustrate the relationships between ecological and social state components. This framework was the foundation for the development of the final social-ecological system model which we simulated using an Ecopath with Ecosim model. We simulated four gear/species restrictions for the reef-based fishery, two fishing scenarios associated with the opening of hypothetical no-take Marine Protected Areas for the deepwater-based fishery, and a Constant Effort (No Action) scenario. Despite limitations in the model, our approach shows that when social and economic objectives and social-ecological relationships are defined, we can quantify the trade-offs among the identified societal objectives to support managers in choosing among alternative interventions.},

abstract={This study aims to explore the use of the social-ecological system (SES) in tourism of a mountain area. Authors examined residents' perceptions of tourism impacts on four SES aspects: ecosystems, local knowledge, people and technology and property rights institutions. The aim is to find area that will be a ``common ground{''} for community and area that can be a source of conflict and will require additional work to solve the differences. Second objective was to examine residents' perception towards future local development tourism policies (winter tourism, seasonality and environment and culture) and how those policies can affect natural, socio-economic and cultural aspects of mountain area. Residents' perceptions of sustainable tourism development potential, perceived tourism impacts, analysis of community attachment and employment sector of stakeholder were involved in this study. The authors applied the Q-methodology, as one SES-allied approach, in a small mountain community of Kopaonik, the Republic of Serbia. The results revealed that residents' agreement/disagreement is connected with two aspects: ecosystem and property rights and that ecosystem can be significantly influenced by all three development policies. Findings suggest that development of future natural conservation plans and new cultural attractions can have positive effects on all parts of social-ecological system. Some practical implications of those findings for tourism planning and development are also discussed.},

abstract={A growing number of studies suggest a participatory ecosystem approach to support decision-making toward resilience and sustainability in social-ecological systems. Social-ecological resilience (SER) principles and practices are recommended to manage natural crises. However, it is necessary to broaden our understanding of SER on human-induced disturbances driven by economic development projects. In this paper we present the social-ecological system of Araca Bay (Brazil), a small-scale fishery community that has experienced successive disturbances due to development projects since the 1930s. There was a lack of studies about the impacts of development projects in this bay. As part of a major project that aimed to build an ecosystem-based management plan for Araca Bay through a participatory planning process, we focused on investigating fishers' traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) to understand Araca Bay's small-scale fisheries social-ecological system. The objectives were to: (1) investigate fishers' TEK regarding management practices and linked social mechanisms, human-induced disturbances and their consequences for the social-ecological system, ecosystem goods and services, and future threats; and (2) provide information based on TEK to the participatory planning process and analyze its contribution to Araca Bay's ecosystem-based management plan. Combined methods were used during 3 years of intense research-action (2014-2017): in-depth ethno-oceanographic interviews with expert fishers; monitoring Araca Bay participatory meetings; and participant observation. Genuine local practices and social mechanisms from traditional culture were recorded, as well as TEK about 57 target fish species and methods to protect habitats and natural resources. Fishers also reported ecosystem disturbances and recovery processes. TEK was codified through SWOT analysis to assist the participatory planning process. Ecosystem services and threats based on TEK were brought to the participatory process, acknowledged by the participants, and incorporated into the management plan. TEK analysis proved to be an important methodology to provide historical environmental data regarding the impacts of development projects and support planning in disturbed ecosystems. In order to support coastal marine ecosystem-based management strategies toward SER and sustainability, researchers and practitioners should consider traditional territories in planning, recognize local practices and social mechanisms, and consider TEK on ecosystem goods and services and on historical human-induced disturbances.},

abstract={As finfish fisheries increasingly shrink due to overexploitation, management and industry have shifted their attention to the world's squid fisheries. The emergence of squid fisheries in the global seafood market calls for well-designed and effective management strategies if they are to remain viable. This study assesses the efficacy of squid governance from a social-ecological perspective in three fisheries. This analysis uses an evidence-based approach to characterize the social-ecological system variables that contribute to each fishery management system meeting its stated goals. To do so, I test the hypothesis that the presence of the ten institutional design principles formulated by common pool resource theory leads to more effective squid fishery management. I measure five outcome variables (governance system effect, commons condition trend, basin switch, user group well-being, compliance) to assess governance effectiveness from social and ecological perspectives. This is the first attempt to examine the design principles and operationalize Ostrom's Social-Ecological System framework to compare globally competitive squid fisheries. Results indicate that each of the three analyzed squid governance systems has met its specified management goals and is associated with positive social and ecological outcomes. Using the Socio-Ecological Systems Meta-Analysis Database (SESMAD), I used secondary data supplemented with semi-structured interviews with key informants to find a strong presence of the design principles in each case. Findings suggest effective squid governance is associated with user-involvement in system operations and contextually appropriate policies, rather than a single overarching squid based strategy.},

abstract={Natural resource sustainability depends on adaptive capacity: the latent ability of a social-ecological system to rely on or implement effective strategies to cope with disturbances. We propose and implement a new three-step framework for studying a social-ecological system's adaptive capacity that consists of assessment, strategy identification, and activation. We apply this framework to analyze the adaptive capacity of the Monterey Bay wetfish fisheries community in response to a significant stressor in the system: El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO). We conducted 49 semi-structured interviews with participants engaged in these fisheries and/or providing ENSO information. Of the 67 social-ecological strategies identified through a literature review, we found 42 contribute to high adaptive capacity to ENSO. The most influential strategies were matching formal and informal rules to system dynamics, diversifying livelihoods, enhancing economic safety nets, social learning, and accessing early warning systems. Our findings suggest approaches for enhancing adaptive capacity in other resource systems.},

abstract={The paper contributes to the social-ecological systems literature by adapting and using Elinor Ostrom's Social-Ecological System (SES) framework in the context of a coastal ecosystem. We modified the SES framework in the case of the Cienaga Grande de Santa Marta (CGSM), an estuarine lagoon in the Caribbean coast of Colombia. The ecological importance of CGSM and its species is undeniable. This paper aims to understand why collective action for a sustainable use of CGSM's fishery resources has not taken place. In order to respond to that question, we created new variables within the social, economic, and political settings of the SES framework. The results show that the fishers' fear of the indiscriminate and strong violence that illegal armed groups have inflicted on them since the 1960s and the economic development in the Colombian Caribbean region help explain the lack of collective action.},

abstract={Understanding changes over historical timescales is essential to gauge conservation status of a species. Modern ecological data typically neglect past magnitudes of change, which fortunately can be evaluated by bridging disparate knowledge sources. We synthesized zooarchaeological, historical, traditional, and western science knowledge to document changes in relative abundance of key species in Canada's northern abalone social-ecological system (SES) from the Holocene to present. Integrated models fit to traditional and western science data revealed 3.7\% annual population decline from 1940s to 2010s for large abalone, although traditional knowledge density estimates were 9.5x higher than those derived from western science. Abalone are presently scarce compared to the mid-1900s, but more abundant than before the early 1800s, calling their endangered status into question. Linking multiple knowledge sources can build SES understanding, facilitate power sharing, and support ecologically sustainable and socially just conservation outcomes.},

journal={ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
year={2015},
volume={20},
number={4},
pages={NA},
month={NA},
abstract={We developed an empirical approach to consider social-ecological system change and transformation by drawing on resource users' knowledge and perceptions. We applied this approach in the Cau Hai lagoon, a coastal area dominated by small-scale fisheries in central Vietnam. Nine focus groups with more than 70 fishers were used to gather information about key social-ecological system elements and interactions, historical social-ecological dynamics, and possible thresholds between distinct social-ecological system identities. The patterns of change in livelihoods and resource exploitation in the Cau Hai lagoon are similar to those seen in other coastal lagoon and small-scale fishery contexts. Our findings show some promise for the use of local knowledge and the perceptions of resource user communities to understand and characterize social-ecological transformations. Importantly, however, we also demonstrate how social-ecological transformations are complicated processes driven by many factors beyond the control of any singular individual or group. We argue that (1) the occurrence of social-ecological transformations can result in either positive or negative outcomes and (2) that we need to direct our thinking away from drawing tidy conclusions about if and when social-ecological transformations take place. Our research also encourages scholars to carefully consider how we frame the benefits of participatory, community-based governance initiatives. Importantly, we need to examine the ways that governance initiatives will be beneficial for some people and detrimental for others, and we need to be fully aware of locally contested interests and acknowledge competing priorities for fisheries management and human well-being. Community-oriented assessments informed by resilience thinking can help to open up questions about economic, political, cultural, and environmental aspects of undesirable path dependencies and traps.},

month={DEC},
abstract={This research examines how the Kandozi indigenous group governs access to fish and timber for sale and evaluates their perceptions of sustainability of those natural resources. The Kandozi occupy a biodiverse tropical forest in the northern Peruvian Amazon with lakes and seasonally flooded areas. Qualitative methods and a comparative examination of access to resources were used to explore current processes that shape access and the people's perceptions of their benefit from natural resources. Results indicated that environmental heterogeneity, kinship, land tenure, the legal framework, and knowledge all shaped access with some differences due to the dissimilar natures of fish and timber. This research concludes that the sustainability of this and similar systems are dependent upon the moment at which the analysis is done, because of the changing needs of people over time, in addition to changes in external factors and the natural variations that occur in the resources used. The range of relations and interactions among different processes that shape access, and the historically contingent characteristic of access and its evolution over time, help better understand the complexity of a given social-ecological system.},

abstract={Conducting social-ecological system (SES) research in fisheries aimed at aiding the implementation of a management plan that achieves sustainable outcomes remains a significant challenge. Using the Ostrom (2009) {[}1] diagnostic SES framework is widely utilized and acknowledged as an integral tool for research on SESs. The purpose of this article is to highlight and illustrate a comprehensive and holistic protocol for operationalizing SES framework research and development for adaptively managing small-scale fisheries. The conceptual approach, displayed in an illustrative framework, and article structure are framed around the following six key steps: (1) contextually updating the SES framework, (2) classify the fishery with the updated framework, (3) indentify and analyze data gaps and as many system component interactions as possible, (4) recognize multiple outcomes, (5) develop an adaptive management plan, and (6) implement the management plan and monitor the system. The illustrative conceptual approach additionally integrates stakeholder involvement and system feedbacks. The implementation and support for each step is elaborated on along with exemplary literature relating to the specific case studies. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Modeling social-ecological systems is difficult due to the complexity of ecosystems and of individual and collective human behavior. Key components of the social-ecological system are often over-simplified or omitted. Generalized modeling is a dynamical systems approach that can overcome some of these challenges. It can rigorously analyze qualitative system dynamics such as regime shifts despite incomplete knowledge of the model's constituent processes. Here, we review generalized modeling and use a recent study on the Baltic Sea cod fishery's boom and collapse to demonstrate its application to modeling the dynamics of empirical social-ecological systems. These empirical applications demand new methods of analysis suited to larger, more complicated generalized models. Generalized modeling is a promising tool for rapidly developing mathematically rigorous, process-based understanding of a social-ecological system's dynamics despite limited knowledge of the system. Recommendations for Resource Managers Understanding empirical social-ecological dynamics requires integrating quantitative and qualitative data Generalized modeling can analyze qualitative dynamics, such as regime shifts, by integrating both qualitative and quantitative data Generalized modeling is well-suited to use in participatory or collaborative settings},

title={Capacity building for tourism development in a nested social-ecological system-A case study of the South Penghu Archipelago Marine National Park, Taiwan},

abstract={In subnational small-island settings with a relatively undisturbed natural environment and an out migration population, tourism development is often used as an alternative development strategy for economic and social regeneration. When such tourism development entails place-based management, such as in a marine protected area (MPA), tourism development can also be used as a strategy for alleviating the conflict between conservation and development as well as for increasing community participation. Local support and capacity building prior to tourism development are essential for involving local communities. Local communities are often complex and heterogeneous, and tourism development must be tailored to match their diverse needs. In this case study, three communities within the South Penghu Archipelago, where a marine national park and development of the tourism industry has been proposed, were investigated. This study assessed the perception of tourism development among community actors and the demands for capacity building to cope with future changes by conducting a social ecological system (SES) analysis wherein the South Penghu MPA was considered a nested SES composed of subsystems. The subsystems focused on in this study were fishermen and nonfishermen at the functional scale and individual communities at the spatial scale. The results showed that the perceptions on tourism development varied substantially among the community actors and the different sub-SESs because of their different experiences in social ecological interactions. Therefore, tourism development in a regional place-based management, such as in a MPA, must consider the various perceptions of such subsystems on tourism development. Rather than considering all local communities as a general unit, capacity building should be tailored to the needs of the community actors from the various sub-SESs. In addition, support from governmental agencies is essential for the success of community-based MPA policies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

title={The management of the blue whiting fishery as complex social-ecological system: The Galician case},
journal={MARINE POLICY},
year={2012},
volume={36},
number={6},
pages={1301-1308},
month={NOV},
abstract={In Europe, 88\% of fish stocks are being fished beyond Maximum Sustainable Yield and 30\% of stocks are outside of biological limits. The blue whiting fishery is also following a consistent trend of a declining, and the EU recently adopted a 93\% quota decrease for this species. Despite the abundant literature related to genetic aspects of population structure of aquatic resources, few studies have specifically addressed the link between fisheries management and population genetics. Given potential differences in the behavior of different subpopulations, population genetics has great relevance in the correct interpretation of the evolution of stocks. Ignoring the congruence of spatial scales between the population structure of fish species and management units can result in reduced productivity and local reduction of populations. This paper adopts the framework of resilience to explore the social-ecological feedbacks between unobserved genetic diversity and human dimension of the blue whiting fishery in Galician coastal communities due to the mismanagement of the fishery in the EU. The results presented here suggest that there is considerable evidence that the currently used management unit is inconsistent with the recent growth and genetic differences observed. The results also reveal that based on the evidence currently available and in accordance with the precautionary principle, the stocks of blue whiting in Northern and Southern ICES areas should be treated as separate in the Northeast Atlantic Ocean. The results obtained indicate that unobserved genetic diversity of the fishery can lead to an equivocal reduction of fishing quotas in the Southern area. Finally, the paper also shows that the total economic losses resulting from the 93\% quota decrease of the species, which includes effects on the rest of the Galician economy, is 40,081,636 Euros per year. The next Common Fishery Policy Reform offers a great opportunity to reverse the current unsustainable path of the fishery and to accept humans as a component of this marine social-ecological system.

abstract={This paper applies a participatory approach in evaluating small-scale fisheries, focusing on the Arapaima gigas fishery in the Brazilian Amazon. The evaluation uses the social-ecological system (SES) framework, adopted to explain the conditions needed for sustainability and user cooperation in natural resources management, as a more suitable alternative to the `blueprint' or `panaceas' approaches, based only on property rights or governmental intervention. However, managers and users often do not have the necessary information compiled and available for a specific SES while some actions need to be taken immediately. Thus, consensus and negotiation among stakeholders about SES variables may be useful to evaluate system performance and indicate actions to promote sustainability. In the case study, using a consensus-building model, we found that arapaima SES leads to sustainability and is far from being a case of `tragedy of the commons.' More investments in suitable monitoring and enforcement for adaptive management are recommended. Adopting an SES framework based on stakeholders' prospects may be useful until complete interdisciplinary studies become available so as to seek of sustainability in the long term.},

abstract={We present a collaboratively developed social-ecological model of the Kenai River Fishery. We developed the model through iterative interviews with stakeholders throughout the Kenai Peninsula using a novel participatory Fuzzy Cognitive Mapping process grounded in Ostrom's social-ecological systems framework. Individual social -ecological models, developed one-on-one with stakeholders, were combined into a single aggregated model representing the system's structure and function. We validated this aggregated model through subsequent in-terviews with stakeholders and focused literature reviews. The result is a model that can: 1) illustrate the breadth and interconnectedness of the Kenai River Fishery's social-ecological system; 2) be used to facilitate discussions around management of the fishery; and 3) be used to explore the components and interactions that move the system toward or away from sustainability. Using the model, we identify how the nature of salmon (migratory) and their habitat (large and unpredictable) leads to uncertainty about effective management strategies. This uncertainty, in addition to a large and diverse set of resource users, creates conflicting management goals that ultimately limit the governance system in making decisions that might increase the sustainability of the fishery.},

volume={30},

pages={109-119},
month={MAR},
abstract={The social ecological system (SES) framework is used to investigate the success of discard management, by gathering knowledge from worldwide examples of discard management applications. The literature search confirmed that most efforts aiming to reduce discards were implemented under top-down management schemes. For about half of the case studies where management tools were applied, a reduction of discards was achieved. To determine the attributes that influence the discard management success, a probabilistic classifier model (Naive Bayes Classifier) was used. This revealed that commonly used interventions to reduce discards can be ineffective unless advice is given in alternative forms that have societal acceptance. The role of social cohesion and stakeholder enforcement mechanisms is underlined and increases the odds of meeting successfully the recommendations for achieving sustainable fisheries. A successful combination of attributes that can lead to the minimization of discards requires robust social capital along with top-down measures. Overall, the classification algorithm proves the usefulness of the SES framework to describe the fishery response to managerial efforts that aim to reduce discarding. Establishment of links between fishing communities and scientists are the key for enhancing stakeholder engagement, increasing compliance and minimizing discards.},

abstract={Angler groups and water-body types interact to create a complex social-ecological system. Network analysis could inform detailed mechanistic models on, and provide managers better information about, basic patterns of fishing activity. Differences in behavior and reservoir selection among angler groups in a regional fishery, the Salt Valley fishery in southeastern Nebraska, USA, were assessed using a combination of cluster and network analyses. The four angler groups assessed ranged from less active, unskilled anglers (group One) to highly active, very skilled anglers (group Four). Reservoir use patterns and the resulting network communities of these four angler groups differed; the number of reservoir communities for these groups ranged from two to three and appeared to be driven by reservoir location (group One), reservoir size and its associated attributes (groups Two and Four), or an interaction between reservoir size and location (group Three). Network analysis is a useful tool to describe differences in participation among angler groups within a regional fishery, and provides new insights about possible recruitment of anglers. For example, group One anglers fished reservoirs closer to home and had a greater probability of dropping out if local reservoir access were restricted.},

abstract={Climate change will impact on ecological, social, and economic elements of fisheries; however, the three are seldom considered in an integrated fashion. We develop a fishery-level assessment of economic resilience to climate change for the Tasmanian rock lobster fishery, a linked social-ecological system. We outline the main climate change forcing influences that link climate change to the fishery via changes in lobster abundance, distribution, and phenology. Using a bottom-up approach, we identify twelve economic attributes strongly related to the fisheries' economic resilience to climate change. Resilience attributes are grouped according to the level of the economic domain (business, sectoral, and governance). Attributes are then evaluated to determine the overall economic resilience of the rock lobster fishery in the context of the specific nature of predicted climate change effects. We identify areas of low resilience in the economic sub-system for this fishery. Evaluating the economic resilience of regional fisheries using this integrated, interdisciplinary framework provides a practical, parsimonious, and conceptually sound basis for undertaking comprehensive and contextually tailored assessments of climate change impacts and economic vulnerability. The framework can be extended to include a broader range of climate change impacts and the social domain of the human sub-system.},

abstract={In February and March 2017, a coastal El Nino caused extraordinary heavy rains and a rise in water temperatures along the coast of northern Peru. In this work, we document the impacts of this phenomenon on the artisanal fisheries and the scallop aquaculture sector, both of which represent important socio-economic activities for the province of Sechura. Despite the perceived absence of effective disaster management and rehabilitation policies, resource users opted for a wide range of different adaptation strategies and are currently striving towards recovery. One year after the event, the artisanal fisheries fleet has returned to operating almost on a normal scale, while the aquaculture sector is still drastically impacted, with many people continuing to work in different economic sectors and even in other regions of the country. Recovery of the social-ecological system of Sechura likely depends on the occurrence of scallop seed and the financial capacity of small-scale producers to reinitiate scallop cultures. Long-term consequences of this coastal El Nino are yet to be studied, though the need to develop trans-local and trans-sectoral management strategies for coping with disturbance events of this scale is emphasized.},

abstract={Informing fishery management decisions using coupled socio-ecological systems (CSES) models requires model construction that captures the systems interactions with high precision. Ecological uncertainty in fishery models is easily reduced using existing scientific literature, but social drivers are often poorly defined or understood. The lack of knowledge about fishermen behavior results in inaccurate models of questionable utility for fishery managers. We designed and constructed a high fidelity agent based model (ABM) using the socio-ecological framework that reduces social system uncertainty by capturing complex behaviors using data-driven bounded rationality and feedback. The resulting generalized ABM of CSES dynamics was instantiated to Pacific salmon fisheries at Kenai river in Upper Cook Inlet, Alaska. The data-driven model construction fuses multiple data-sets for classification of social and ecological fishery regimes into stochastic distributions; the agent behaviors were generalized by evolving parametrized equations using data-driven machine learning; multiple non-trivial metrics on multiple scales verified model's accuracy and predictive capacity. The verified model of CSES dynamics at the Kenai river revealed recent instability in the dipnet fishery coupled dynamics, historic instability in the drift gillnet fishery coupled dynamics due to a compensatory and aggressive fishing strategy, and in the future the model will be used for scenario-based studies to understand the outcomes of alternative management strategies.

journal={ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
year={2014},
volume={19},
number={3},
pages={NA},
month={NA},
abstract={Frameworks play an important role in analyzing social-ecological systems (SESs) because they provide shared concepts and variables that enable comparison between and accumulation of knowledge across multiple cases. One prominent SES framework focusing on local resource use has been developed by Elinor Ostrom and her colleagues. This framework is an extensive multi-tier collection of concepts and variables that have demonstrated relevance for explaining outcomes in a large number of case studies in the context of fishery, water, and forestry common-pool resources. The further development of this framework has raised a number of issues related to the formal relationships between the large number of concepts and variables involved. In particular, issues related to criteria for ordering the concepts into tiers, adding new concepts, defining outcomes metrics, and representing dynamics in the framework have been identified. We address these issues by applying methods from research fields that study formal relationships between concepts such as domain-specific languages, knowledge representation, and software engineering. We find that SES frameworks could include the following seven formal components: variables, concepts, attribution relationships, subsumption relationships, process relationships, aggregation relationships, and evaluation metrics. Applying these components to the Ostrom framework and a case study of recreational fishery, we find that they provide clear criteria for structuring concepts into tiers, defining outcome metrics, and representing dynamics. The components identified are generic, and the insights gained from this exercise may also be beneficial for the development of other SES frameworks.},

abstract={The growing demand for ecological resources puts pressure on many ecosystems and, in extreme cases, threatens the long-term survival of the associated social-ecological system. The sustainable use of resources helps to avoid the collapse of the system, but requires the balancing of two conflicting aims: the preservation of resource productivity and the provision of satisfactory returns. Although humans can consider expected future pay-offs in decision-making, the inherent variability of ecological resources makes future returns uncertain and complicates the determination of sustainable harvest behaviours. We present here an adaptive model in which human harvest behaviour is linked to a renewable resource with a randomly fluctuating growth rate. In the model, users adjust their harvest behaviour following a trade-off between the potential current harvest and the discounted future productivity of the resource. Our analyses reveal that rising resource variability increases the discount factor required for a sustainable harvest and reduces long-term pay-offs. A high discount factor, indicating certain future returns, makes the user-resource system robust against resource fluctuations albeit at the cost of a lowered maximum total harvest. By considering the user-resource system as a single co-evolving entity, our approach allows for the determination of sustainable harvest strategies in randomly fluctuating environments.

abstract={The framework proposed by Ostrom (2009) has become one of the most utilized tools to address the complexity of social-ecological systems. Most cases use this framework to analyze the systems from the perspective of a single resource unit. However, the livelihoods in several coastal communities are diverse, so that the users interact with multiple common-pool resources, which makes their analysis difficult. In this sense, it is important to identify the key elements of management to achieve the sustainable use of the resources. In this study, we were able to do this in a coastal community where commercial fishing, ecotourism, and recreational fishing coexist. The system of interest, located in the state of Quintana Roo, Mexico, was subdivided by resource type using a multi-method approach to data collection including surveys, interviews, and records review. A conceptual map was developed that shows how the second-tier variables are integrated through the governance and actors with the biophysical system. The actors involved in lobster fishing achieved a more complex governance system, followed by the ecotourism and recreational fishing; the complexity of the governance was related with the equity level of the actors. The analysis revealed the research gaps to develop management strategies and improve the sustainability of the system.},

journal={ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
year={2013},
volume={18},
number={4},
pages={NA},
month={NA},
abstract={South Africa's small pelagics fishery is currently the largest in volume and second largest in value in the southern Benguela. It exploits short-lived, small pelagic fishes such as anchovy (for reduction into fish meal and oil) and sardine (for reduction as well as human consumption through canned products), and to a lesser extent redeye round herring and mesopelagics, largely for reduction. We explore the recent history (1940s to present) of the social-ecological system around this fishery. The natural subsystem, at the scales of the ocean environment and the ecosystem, is characterized by high interannual and documented decadal-scale variability. We characterize the human social subsystem at the scales of the fishing industry, legislation, and west coast fishing towns, and demonstrate interdependencies between the natural and social subsystems by following system-scale changes. The pelagic fishing industry has evolved to deal with variability through consolidation, diversification, and range expansion. Legislation has increasingly looked for conservation of the resource while ensuring economic viability of the industry, and hence factory-and vessel-related jobs. Fishing communities under apartheid stayed largely dependent on company-generated infrastructure, combining seasonal employment in the fishing factories with inshore fishing, targeting rock lobster and line fish. While the pelagic industry persisted and communities survived, the resource base for both offshore and inshore fisheries gradually eroded. The advent of democracy in the mid-1990s brought allocation of long-term fishing rights to individuals or companies under conditions of depleted inshore resources aggravated by a shift in the distribution of pelagic fish away from the west coast towards the Cape south coast in the second half of the 1990s. The resultant loss of employment and fishing rights in the inshore has generated community coping strategies that include poaching and challenges to the current Marine Living Resources Act, while the industry continues to expand by range and species, possibly further eroding the resource base. We argue that the situation in the pelagic social-ecological system is indicative of further loss of resilience to change. Coping with future long-term, system-scale change will necessitate careful long-term scenario planning among the various interest groups involved, joint research being one way to overcome the communications breakdown and initiate the joint planning process.},

abstract={This study describes the progress of the use of the SES perspective and/or the consideration of users' participation in the scientific literature that study Mexican fisheries, and their inclusion in the fishery management policy. Since 2001, there have been 57 published investigations on 19 fisheries, mostly from the north Pacific (n = 39), focussed mainly on the governance of SES of benthic fisheries, and from the southern Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea (n = 14), where co-management and the spiny lobster fishery are the most studied. From 21 fisheries having a fishery management plan (FMP), only seven have an international sustainability standard, while another seven fisheries having a sustainability standard have no FMP. In addition, only nine fisheries, with literature that addresses the SES perspective and/or considers the user's participation (out of a total of 19), have a FMP and only four of those fisheries have a sustainability standard. This reflects a mismatch between the interests of the academic, fishery, and government sectors. The SES perspective has been stable in the academic research since 2012, and has been implemented for some fisheries through participatory management processes of international fishery standards; however, this perspective needs to be fully included in Mexican fishery management instruments (e.g., FMPs) and its implementation could be a primary goal for Mexican fishery policy.},

title={Exploring social-ecological trade-offs in fisheries using a coupled food web and human behavior model},
journal={ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
year={2021},
volume={26},
number={2},
pages={NA},
month={JUN},
abstract={Marine fisheries represent a social-ecological system driven by both complex ecological processes and human interactions. Ecosystem-based fisheries management requires an understanding of both the biological and social components, and management failure can occur when either are excluded. Despite the significance of both, most research has focused on characterizing biological uncertainty rather than on better understanding the impacts of human behavior because of the difficulty of incorporating human behavior into simulation models. In this study, we use the fisheries in Narragansett Bay (Rhode Island, USA) as a case study to demonstrate how coupled modeling can be used to represent interactions between the food web and fishers in a social-ecological system. Narragansett Bay holds both a commercial fishery for forage fish, i.e., Atlantic menhaden (Brevoortia tyrannus) and a recreational fishery for their predators, i.e. striped bass (Morone saxatilis) and bluefish (Pomatomus saltatrix). To explore trade-offs between these two fisheries, we created a food web model and then coupled it to a recreational fishers' behavior model, creating a dynamic social-ecological representation of the ecosystem. Fish biomass was projected until 2030 in both the stand-alone food web model and the coupled social-ecological model, with results highlighting how the incorporation of fisher behavior in modeling can lead to changes in the ecosystem. We examined how model outputs varied in response to three attributes: (1) the forage fish commercial harvest scenario, (2) the predatory (piscivorous) fish abundance-catch relationship in the recreational fishery, and (3) the rate at which recreational fishers become discouraged (termed ``satisfaction loss{''}). Higher commercial harvest of forage fish led to lower piscivorous fish biomass but had minimal effects on the number of piscivorous fish caught recreationally or recreational fisher satisfaction. Both the abundancecatch relationship and satisfaction loss rate had notable effects on the fish biomass, the number of fish caught recreationally, and recreational fisher satisfaction. Currently, the lack of spatial and location-specific fisher behavior data limits the predictive use of our model. However, our modeling framework shows that fisher behavior can be successfully incorporated into a coupled social-ecological model through the use of agent-based modeling, and our results highlight that its inclusion can influence ecosystem dynamics. Because fisher decision making and the ecosystem can influence one another, social responses to changing ecosystems should be explicitly integrated into ecosystem modeling to improve ecosystem-based fisheries management efforts.},

title={Mechanisms of resilience in common-pool resource management systems:: an agent-based model of water use in a river basin},
journal={ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
year={2007},
volume={12},
number={2},
pages={NA},
month={DEC},
abstract={The concept of resilience is widely promoted as a promising notion to guide new approaches to ecosystem and resource management that try to enhance a system's capacity to cope with change. A variety of mechanisms of resilience specific for different systems have been proposed. In the context of resource management those include but are not limited to the diversity of response options and flexibility of the social system to adaptively respond to changes on an adequate scale. However, implementation of resilience-based management in specific real-world systems has often proven difficult because of a limited understanding of suitable interventions and their impact on the resilience of the coupled social-ecological system. We propose an agent-based modeling approach to explore system characteristics and mechanisms of resilience in a complex resource management system, based on a case study of water use in the Amudarya River, which is a semiarid river basin. Water resources in its delta are used to sustain irrigated agriculture as well as aquatic ecosystems that provide fish and other ecosystem services. The three subsystems of the social-ecological system, i.e., the social system, the irrigation system, and an aquatic ecosystem, are linked by resource flows and the allocation decision making of actors on different levels. Simulation experiments are carried out to compare the resilience of different institutional settings of water management to changes in the variability and uncertainty of water availability. The aim is to investigate the influence of ( 1) the organizational structure of water management, ( 2) information on water availability, and ( 3) the diversity of water uses on the resilience of the system to short and long-term water scarcity. In this paper, the model concept and first simulation results are presented. As a first illustration of the approach the performances of a centralized and a decentralized regime are compared under different scenarios of information on water availability. Under the given conditions of a regularly fluctuating inflow and compliance of agents with orders from a national authority, the centralized system performs better as long as irrigation is the only type of water use. Diversification of resource use, e. g., irrigation and fishing, increases the performance of the decentralized regime and the resilience of both. Systematic analysis of the performance of different system structures will help to identify properties and mechanisms of resilience. This understanding will be valuable for the identification, development, and evaluation of management interventions in specific river basins.},

journal={NA},
year={2020},
volume={6},

pages={23-61},
month={NA},
abstract={Describing the ecological character of Chilika has enabled advances in the formal conceptualisations and definition adopted by the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands to be presented, in particular through the inclusion of ecosystem services and governance settings. The evolution of the concept of ecological character is described and related to the parallel concept of ensuring the wise use of wetlands. Framing the ecological character of Chilika as a social-ecological system allows for identification and prioritization of a number of wetland features from their ecological and social subsystems, as well as pathways for governance systems that can be guided by the needs of meeting the limits of acceptable change for these parameters. Uncertainty about the trajectory of changes in ecological character calls for continued efforts in knowledge building, experimental management design, bridging different knowledge systems, and ongoing monitoring and evaluation. The Chilika Development Authority can enable such by: (a) enhancing knowledge and understanding of critical ecosystem functions and their relationship with system dynamics (particularly species migration and exchange between riverine, lagoon and sea; sediment and nutrient dynamics; and factors influencing distribution of macrophytes); (b) feeding ecological knowledge into management decisions and actions (such as the regulation of interferences to migratory pathways or species habitats, regulation of tourism pressure on critical habitats); (c) supporting the development of multilevel governance systems, and polycentric institutional and organizational linkages (particularly linking the role of fisher cooperatives, tourism associations, village panchayats within the overarching governance regime); and, (d) developing capacity for dealing with perturbations and uncertainties, specifically in the context of climate change.},

abstract={Social capital is an important resource that can be mobilized for purposive action or competitive gain. The distribution of social capital in social-ecological systems can determine who is more productive at extracting ecological resources and who emerges as influential in guiding their management, thereby empowering some while disempowering others. Despite its importance, the factors that contribute to variation in social capital among individuals have not been widely studied. We adopt a network perspective to examine what determines social capital among individuals in social-ecological systems. We begin by identifying network measures of social capital relevant for individuals in this context, and review existing evidence concerning their determinants. Using a complete social network dataset from Hawaii's longline fishery, we employ social network analysis and other statistical methods to empirically estimate these measures and determine the extent to which individual stakeholder attributes explain variation within them. We find that ethnicity is the strongest predictor of social capital. Measures of human capital (i.e., education, experience), years living in the community, and information-sharing attitudes are also important. Surprisingly, we find that when controlling for other factors, industry leaders and formal fishery representatives are generally not well connected. Our results offer new quantitative insights on the relationship between stakeholder diversity, social networks, and social capital in a coupled social-ecological system, which can aid in identifying barriers and opportunities for action to overcome resource management problems. Our results also have implications for achieving resource governance that is not only ecologically and economically sustainable, but also equitable.},

abstract={Variability on multiple temporal and spatial scales exposes fishers and fishing communities to multiple stressors. The impact and interplay of these stressors need to be considered to improve our understanding of social-ecological linkages if sustainable livelihoods are to be promoted. To this end, participant-led research was conducted in the small-scale traditional commercial linefishery of the southern Cape (South Africa) between Witsand and Mossel Bay. Knowledge and perceptions regarding stressors responsible for changes in the social-ecological system, which ultimately affect the fishers' ability to fish successfully, were recorded using semi-formal interviews and focus groups with 50 participants. The results presented not only offer valuable insights into the day-to-day experiences of these fishers, but also expose knowledge gaps that exist in micro-scale interactions influencing the fishery system. An analysis of various stressors is presented, which includes the impacts of and responses to climate variability; challenges presented by fisheries policies and regulatory frameworks; social and economic considerations; inadequate infrastructure; and general political considerations. The development of a more comprehensive understanding of stressors that affect the social-ecological system at various scales provides valuable insights into a fishery system that is currently not well described, and provides the basis for analyses into vulnerability and resilience. Significance: Understanding the impact and interplay of stressors at multiple scales is important if sustainable livelihoods are to be promoted. This research provides insight into the day-to-day experiences of fishers whilst exposing knowledge gaps that exist at a micro-scale.},

journal={ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},

volume={23},
number={1},
pages={NA},
month={NA},
abstract={Almost a half million fishers in Bangladesh are predominantly reliant on the hilsa shad (Tenualosa ilisha) fishery in the Meghna River and estuarine ecosystem. This paper adopts a broadened concept of social-ecological traps to frame the complex dynamics that emerge from social and ecological interactions in this highly natural resource-dependent social-ecological system (SES). We analyze how endogenous self-reinforcing processes in the system and poor initial conditions, particularly debt and lack of livelihood options outside fisheries, keep fishing households in poverty. We identify a policy decision in favor of incentive-based fisheries management as a critical juncture that influenced a trajectory of recovery in hilsa shad stocks in this complex adaptive system. Normative assessment of stakeholder perceptions indicates that fishers perceive a nominal improvement in well-being as a result of this policy. Compensation in return for compliance with a seasonal fishing ban in sanctuary areas does not, however, disrupt trap dynamics perpetuating the cycle of poverty, social exclusion, and political disempowerment in which fishing households are entrenched. Poverty and lack of alternative livelihood opportunities remain significant reasons for noncompliance with the ban as long as fishers do not have any meaningful representation in resource management and decision making. A secured tenure system through adaptive comanagement involving fishers in monitoring and enforcement of compliance with fishing bans, supported by sustainable finance for livelihood improvements outside of natural resource exploitation and predicated on responsive and accountable institutions for and by people who depend on the fishery, can form the foundation for local stewardship in a unique demonstration of contemporary large-scale open-water fisheries governance in this complex SES.},

abstract={This study provides an integrated perspective to ecosystem based management (EBM) by considering a diverse array of societal goals, i.e. sustainable food supply, clean energy and a healthy marine ecosystem, and a selection of management measures to achieve them. The primary aim of this exercise is to provide guidance for (more) integrated EBM in the North Sea based on an evaluation of the effectiveness of those management measures in contributing to the conservation of marine biodiversity. A secondary aim is to identify the requirements of the knowledge base to guide such future EBM initiatives. Starting from the societal goals we performed a scoping exercise to identify a ``focal social-ecological system{''} which is a subset of the full social-ecological system but considered adequate to guide EBM towards the achievement of those societal goals. A semi-quantitative risk assessment including all the relevant human activities, their pressures and the impacted ecosystem components was then applied to identify the main threats to the North Sea biodiversity and evaluate the effectiveness of the management measures to mitigate those threats. This exercise revealed the need for such risk-based approaches in providing a more integrated perspective but also the trade-off between being comprehensive but qualitative versus quantitative but limited in terms of the ``focal{''} part of the SES that can be covered. The findings in this paper provide direction to the (further) development of EBM and its knowledge base that should ultimately allow an integrated perspective while maintaining its capacity to deliver the accuracy and detail needed for decision-making.

title={A diagnostic procedure for applying the social-ecological systems framework in diverse cases},
journal={ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
year={2015},
volume={20},
number={1},
pages={NA},
month={NA},
abstract={The framework for analyzing sustainability of social-ecological systems (SES) framework of Elinor Ostrom is a multitier collection of concepts and variables that have proven to be relevant for understanding outcomes in diverse SES. The first tier of this framework includes the concepts resource system (RS) and resource units (RU), which are then further characterized through lower tier variables such as clarity of system boundaries and mobility. The long-term goal of framework development is to derive conclusions about which combinations of variables explain outcomes across diverse types of SES. This will only be possible if the concepts and variables of the framework can be made operational unambiguously for the different types of SES, which, however, remains a challenge. Reasons for this are that case studies examine other types of RS than those for which the framework has been developed or consider RS for which different actors obtain different kinds of RU. We explore these difficulties and relate them to antecedent work on common-pool resources and public goods. We propose a diagnostic procedure which resolves some of these difficulties by establishing a sequence of questions that facilitate the step-wise and unambiguous application of the SES framework to a given case. The questions relate to the actors benefiting from the SES, the collective goods involved in the generation of those benefits, and the action situations in which the collective goods are provided and appropriated. We illustrate the diagnostic procedure for four case studies in the context of irrigated agriculture in New Mexico, common property meadows in the Swiss Alps, recreational fishery in Germany, and energy regions in Austria. We conclude that the current SES framework has limitations when applied to complex, multiuse SES, because it does not sufficiently capture the actor interdependencies introduced through RS and RU characteristics and dynamics.},

title={Sustainability of the Juan Fernandez lobster fishery (Chile) and the perils of generic science-based prescriptions},

abstract={Lobster fishing is the main source of income for the people from the Juan Fernandez Archipelago (population ca. 770), located more than 700 km off central Chile. An artisanal fishery has operated uninterruptedly for more than a century with few harvest controls (season, size, no egg-bearing females). Access to the resource has long been regulated by an informal but well structured traditional sea tenure system, which has effectively constrained the growth of fleet size. Nevertheless, and in spite of a lack of impending crises, assessments conducted over the last 40 years have recurrently diagnosed that effort is well above the optimum level. On that basis, generic ``solutions{''} (quotas, marine protected areas, closures) have been prescribed with no attention to their possible impacts on the users and on traditional tenure arrangements. We discuss the merit of those diagnostics and prescriptions, and conclude that the disruption created by their eventual implementation would threaten the sustainability of the fishery. An analysis of the entire social-ecological system is needed before drastic solutions are prescribed. We investigate the factors that favor sustainability using Ostrom's framework for the analysis of social-ecological systems. Those factors have to do with the resource system (a productive stock with well defined boundaries and divisibility of fishing spots among users), governance (traditional tenure and simple operational rules), the users (few, strongly dependent on the resource, and sharing a detailed mental model of the resource system), and interactions (self-organization and partnerships). The resilience of the system was tested by the devastating tsunami that hit the islands in February 2010. This case study illustrates the need to attend to the interactions among resources, users and institutions in the search for effective solutions and to avoid disruptive management interventions.

abstract={Here, we synthesize conceptual frameworks, applied modeling approaches, and as case studies to highlight complex social-ecological system (SES) dynamics that inform environmental policy, conservation and management. Although a set of ``good practices{''} about what constitutes a good SES study are emerging, there is still a disconnection between generating SES scientific studies and providing decisionrelevant information to policy makers. Classical single variable/hypothesis studies rooted in one or two disciplines are still most common, leading to incremental growth in knowledge about the natural or social system, but rarely both. The recognition of human dimensions is a key aspect of successful planning and implementation in natural resource management, ecosystem-based management, fisheries management, and marine conservation. The lack of social data relating to human-nature interactions in this particular context is now seen as an omission, which can often erode the efficacy of any resource management or conservation action. There have been repeated calls for a transdisciplinary approach to complex SESs that incorporates resilience, complexity science characterized by intricate feedback interactions, emergent processes, non-linear dynamics and uncertainty. To achieve this vision, we need to embrace diverse research methodologies that incorporate ecology, sociology, anthropology, political science, economics and other disciplines that are anchored in empirical data. We conclude that to make SES research most useful in adding practical value to conservation planning, marine resource management planning processes and implementation, and the integration of resilience thinking into adaptation strategies, more research is needed on (1) understanding social-ecological landscapes and seascapes and patterns that would ensure planning process legitimacy, (2) costs of transformation (financial, social, environmental) to a stable resilient social-ecological system, (3) overcoming place-based data collection challenges as well as modeling challenges.

abstract={The participation of diverse actors and usage of traditional and local knowledge have been recognized as important for ecosystem management, including local biodiversity strategies and action plans (LBSAPs) implemented in municipalities. Assessing the effects and influences of the participation of diverse actors and usage of traditional and local knowledge requires analyses by a social-ecological system framework. This study aimed to clarify (1) how the participation of diverse actors and the recognition and usage of traditional knowledge that is passed down from generation to generation, and local knowledge that is unique to a local community were related to LBSAP actions and effects and (2) how various social and ecological factors were related with the participation of diverse actors and traditional and local knowledge. We conducted a questionnaire survey and obtained the data from 70 municipalities that have formulated LBSAPs, in addition to other existing data from various sources. We then performed a multiple regression analysis using the full model including all explanatory variables. A positive relationship was observed between the variables for the participation of diverse actors and traditional and local knowledge and the variables for the information sharing, deliberation processes, the evaluative and investment activities of LBSAPs. For example, deliberation process of an LBSAP was thought to have provided an opportunity to recognize and learn local knowledge. Consciousness of local knowledge and usage of traditional knowledge in an LBSAP were then associated with awareness of change toward biodiversity among citizens. The participation of diverse actors and usage of traditional and local knowledge were influenced by several ecological and social factors such as natural and secondary forests, agricultural lands, population and influential people. These results suggest that participation of diverse actors and usage of traditional and local knowledge have a significant role in the formulation of LBSAPs and their outcomes.},

abstract={Conserving biodiversity with a growing human population is a key sustainability challenge. Consequently, a vast number of development initiatives across the globe have been designed to combine social, economic, and environmental perspectives. For the most part, the development community is well acquainted with the negative experiences and unintended consequences that some projects have or may bring. However, in tropical coastal ecosystems, this aspect is not completely acknowledged, studied, or understood. Here, we use tropical seagrass meadows as a model social-ecological system to investigate how sustainable development initiatives result in unintended consequences with both positive and negative outcomes for environment and society. We analyze the initiatives and their effects in terms of a typology encompassing ???flow???, ???addition???, and ???deletion??? effects and investigate them across four types of sustainable development initiatives that occur within tropical coastal environments: (1) megafauna conservation, (2) alternative livelihood programs, (3) mosquito net malaria prophylaxis, and (4) marine protected areas. Using these four initiatives as examples, we show that sustainable development initiatives can produce unintended effects with major consequences. Further, we illustrate how not assessing such effects may ultimately undermine the initial goals of the sustainable development intervention. Our study suggests that acknowledging unintended effects and transitioning them so that they become sustainable is more effective than ignoring effects or viewing them as trade-offs. We strongly stress the need for an a priori process in which positive effects, negative effects, and potential uncertainties and surprises are considered when planning the development intervention, and we argue for greater social-ecological monitoring of initiatives. As such, this contribution links to contemporary approaches dealing with the sustainability of natural resources and social-ecological systems and bridges with the importance of development initiatives in the context of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.},

abstract={As coastal social-ecological systems (SES) are used for many different purposes and subject to different stressors, they are also among the most vulnerable and change the most rapidly. To achieve resilience, coastal areas require adaptive management based on integrated interdisciplinary approaches, requiring a deep understanding of SES dynamics, i.e. the ecological and social changes that comprise synchronicities and regime shifts. For the purpose of analyzing co-evolution and regime shifts, we propose an original and operational methodology combining (i) a chronosystemic timeline approach and (ii) time series analyses based on indicators from the ``Drivers-Pressures-State-Impacts-Responses{''} framework (14 indicators including population growth, eutrophication status, ecosystem services, management actions and climate change indicators). The methodology was tested on a SES located on the French Mediterranean coast, the Thau lagoon, whose trajectory we studied over a 5-decade period (1970-2018). Our results show that the dynamics of co-evolution and regime shifts of the SES were driven by a succession of interactions between sanitary or ecological crises and management adaptations. During the study period, this typical Mediterranean coastal SES appears to have evolved towards the multiplication of uses, improvement of water quality and more integrative management. Our methodology also highlighted three contrasting periods characterized by stable emerging properties and identified several cause-and-effect relationships, which is rare in historical analyses of SES. These cause-and-effect relationships concern major sanitary and ecological crises that have led to a reorganization of governance mechanisms and to technical remediation actions. Our approach based on long-term trajectories will help identify the conditions required for increasing the resilience of coastal SES and the best management objectives to face new challenges related to global climate change.},

abstract={The literature on coral reefs and human resource use or fishing is reviewed less from the perspective of summarizing findings but more from the sociological perspective of what scientists chose to study, publish, and cite in journal articles. The motivation was to determine if coral reef science is generating information needed to solve the coral reef climate and fisheries crisis that has been publicized in many of the highest visibility and cited publications. The social-ecological system of coral reefs involves the environment, the ecosystem, human harvesting and social organization and the policies that arise from their interaction. Regardless of the focus and findings of any science investigation on this system, recommendations for management are limited, and include restrictions on space, time of use, effort, gear, species, size, and gender. Evaluating the scientific journal literature in the Scopus database on these restrictions indicates a disparity in focus for both publications and citations. The greatest number of scientists and citations are focused on spatial closures and fishing effort, effort seen as the problem and closures the solution. The other restrictions, that represent less extreme forms of management and have lower short-term social costs and trade offs, are not well studied and, when studied, investigated by either a small group of associated colleagues or transient one-publication investigators. When the values, selectivity, and incentives of scientists conflict with resource users desires for knowledge, incentives, and profits the resulting divide can weaken the social relevance and applicability of science and delay real-world problem solving. Societal engagement, acceptance, objectivity, and finding solutions are likely to increase if scientific effort is spread more evenly across this full spectrum of management restrictions and more components of the social-ecological system.

abstract={Tourism is promoted as an environmentally beneficial activity for Caribbean economies. Yet degradation still occurs and more integrated policy approaches are needed. Using Q-methodology within a social-ecological system (SES) framework, we quantified the importance of various policy issues to stakeholders in Providenciales, Turks and Caicos Islands, where tourism produces 77\% of its GDP. Stakeholders agree Providenciales' economy benefits from a healthy marine environment, but disagree over which SES drivers are functionally important. Our results show that Q-methodology is a robust tool for informing the policy-making process and quantifying stakeholder views in a tourism-dependent economy.

month={JUL},
abstract={On the outer coast of Washington state, traditional lifestyles are closely entwined with the marine resources affected by ocean change, e.g., ocean warming, ocean acidification, fishing, coastal development, etc. Our research explores how ongoing ocean change may challenge the social-ecological system surrounding the Quinault Indian Nation's razor clam (Siliqua patula) harvest. We conducted semistructured interviews with Quinault tribal members, scientists, and resource managers to build a conceptual model of the social-ecological system, which we use to (1) understand the emergent effects of changes in availability of razor clams and (2) explore how the tribal community might prepare for or adapt to these changes. Razor clams are a staple food and key source of income for the Quinault people because of their lasting abundance, low cost to harvest, and long season of availability relative to other natural resources. Lower income families experience disproportionate economic impacts during razor clam harvest closures, but less tangible social and cultural impacts are felt broadly throughout the community. Although razor clams have been, in general, available and safe for harvest in recent years, the Quinault people perceive many threats to the resource, including climate change, harmful algal blooms, pollution, and habitat loss. We used the perceived risks identified from the interview results, along with peer-reviewed scientific literature, to develop several ocean change scenarios. Using a stage-based population model of the Pacific razor clam, we explored the relative impacts of these scenarios on annual razor clam harvest over a 20-year period. The simulation of scenarios was developed into a user-friendly web-based application as a planning tool for the Quinault Indian Nation, to help them explore connections between ocean change and razor clam availability, and to support their efforts to plan for and adapt to the impacts of change.},

year={2022},
volume={18},

month={APR 11},
abstract={Background Social-ecological systems are based on particular species and on their direct and human-mediated interactions. The `golden humped tench' or tinca gobba dorata, a variety of tench-Tinca tinca (L., 1758)-traditionally bred in artificial ponds called peschiere in Poirino highlands, northwest Italy, is one of such species. The aim of the study is to investigate the traditional farming of the golden humped tench, the associated knowledge, practices, and gastronomy, and to discuss the changes that the tench, the ponds, and their role in the local social-ecological system are going through. Methods The data analyzed were collected in different locations of Poirino highlands during May-September 2021. Fieldwork included semi-structured interviews (n = 23) with current and former tench farmers about the breeding and gastronomy of the tench and the management of the peschiere. The interviewees' selection occurred through an exponential non-discriminative snowball sampling, and interview transcripts were qualitatively analyzed through inductive thematic content analysis. Results The golden humped tench has been farmed for centuries in ponds used also to water livestock and to irrigate cultivated fields, and managed by every peasant household in the area. This integrated aquaculture system is underpinned by detailed knowledge on the peschiera ecosystem and on the tench life cycle and supports a gastronomic knowledge that is part of the local heritage. The ongoing process of gastronomic valorization of the tench is sustaining the role of the fish in locals' livelihoods and as a marker of regional identity, but it is also transforming tench farming, already threatened by livelihood change, pesticides, and invasive species, in controversial ways. Conclusions We argue that ponds and tenches are core elements of the local social-ecological system, defining the cultural landscape and engendering a form of regional identity around them. Studying integrated aquaculture systems and associated knowledge and practices is relevant to design sustainable systems of food production and to address possibilities of conservation of biodiversity and livelihoods in aquatic environments.},

title={Towards sustainable small-scale fisheries in China: A case study of Hainan},
journal={MARINE POLICY},
year={2020},
volume={121},
number={NA},
pages={NA},
month={NOV},
abstract={China is one of the most important marine fishery countries, yet little is known about its small-scale fisheries (SSFs). This paper uses Hainan Province of China as a case study to examine the present situation, predicaments, and future changes of the country's SSFs during a process of transition from extensive to green development. In doing so, we follow the social-ecological system (SES) framework to present Hainan's SSF-related settings, and study its resource systems, governance systems and actors through reviewing national and local policies, surveying and interviewing SSF stakeholders. Marine fisheries in Hainan is SSF-dominated, experienced dramatic increase in terms of yield and jobs since 1978, and became the main source of most fishermen's livelihood. Fish community structure and fishing targets have shifted from a mix of large-bodied demersals and pelagics to smaller-bodied pelagics with high growth rates and fecundity levels. This degradation puts stress on China's central and local governments to enhance the preservation of marine ecosystems. Effort controls failed to reduce fishing power due to subsidies, a series of measures were introduced in 2015 to correct these problems, including obligatory targets with accountability, subsidy reductions, buyback program, and further reductions of fishing vessels and allowable catch implemented in 2017. Hainan has explored different development directions for SSFs. First, providing policies and funds to reduce small fishing boats and construct larger vessels to support offshore and distant-water fisheries. Second, enhancing fishery value by integrating the development of fishery related primary, secondary, and tertiary industries. Third, developing existing SSFs in a sustainable manner through standardizing SSF vessel types, delineating operating areas, developing fishing port economy, and building beautiful fishing villages. These practices illustrate that China's centralized government can likely command transformational changes in ecological and socio-economic outcomes according to policy objectives. Also, a broadened perspective that considers the ecological, social, and economic dimensions of SSFs as whole is also crucial. Moreover, the integration of fishery policies with other related socioeconomic policies, and the interdepartmental cooperation is needed to achieve policy consistency across local governments.},

title={Coupled human and natural system dynamics as key to the sustainability of Lake Victoria's ecosystem services},
journal={ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
year={2014},
volume={19},
number={4},
pages={NA},
month={NA},
abstract={East Africa's Lake Victoria provides resources and services to millions of people on the lake's shores and abroad. In particular, the lake's fisheries are an important source of protein, employment, and international economic connections for the whole region. Nonetheless, stock dynamics are poorly understood and currently unpredictable. Furthermore, fishery dynamics are intricately connected to other supporting services of the lake as well as to lakeshore societies and economies. Much research has been carried out piecemeal on different aspects of Lake Victoria's system; e.g., societies, biodiversity, fisheries, and eutrophication. However, to disentangle drivers and dynamics of change in this complex system, we need to put these pieces together and analyze the system as a whole. We did so by first building a qualitative model of the lake's social-ecological system. We then investigated the model system through a qualitative loop analysis, and finally examined effects of changes on the system state and structure. The model and its contextual analysis allowed us to investigate system-wide chain reactions resulting from disturbances. Importantly, we built a tool that can be used to analyze the cascading effects of management options and establish the requirements for their success. We found that high connectedness of the system at the exploitation level, through fisheries having multiple target stocks, can increase the stocks' vulnerability to exploitation but reduce society's vulnerability to variability in individual stocks. We describe how there are multiple pathways to any change in the system, which makes it difficult to identify the root cause of changes but also broadens the management toolkit. Also, we illustrate how nutrient enrichment is not a self-regulating process, and that explicit management is necessary to halt or reverse eutrophication. This model is simple and usable to assess system-wide effects of management policies, and can serve as a paving stone for future quantitative analyses of system dynamics at local scales.},

abstract={Marine reserves can create both benefits and costs to fishers. This article explores the perceptions of fishers in Kenya and Seychelles about displacement, spillover, and overall impacts of local marine reserves on their livelihoods. We test whether these perceptions are different among fishers from different geographic and socioeconomic conditions. Sixty-six percent of fishers had been displaced from marine reserves or coastal development and 90\% believed they had caught fishes that spilled over from marine reserves. Poorer fishers in Kenya were both displaced from, and also felt like they benefited from, marine reserves. This highlights how people's experiences with marine reserves, both positive and negative, are affected by a range of social considerations that may not be incorporated in typical evaluations of ecological and economic marine reserve success.},

abstract={We conducted a systematic review of the literature applying Elinor Ostrom's social-ecological systems framework (SESF), with a focus on studies using quantitative methodologies. We synthesized the step-by-step methodological decisions made across 51 studies into a methodological guide and decision tree for future applications of the framework. A synthesis of trends within each methodological step is provided in detail. Our descriptive summary is followed by a critical discussion of how this heterogeneity can lead to ambiguity in the interpretation of findings and hinder synthesis work. These critical reflections are supported by a survey of 22 scholars, each having been a co-author on at least one of the articles reviewed in this study, on the methodological challenges for applying the framework going forward.},

abstract={The literature on institutional fit is developing rapidly within the broader discourse on sustainability which has resulted in a diverse, but sometimes inconsistent program of research. Therefore we review the recent literature on the fit between institutions and social-ecological systems to identify three general types of fit: namely, ecological fit, social fit and social-ecological system fit. Each of these draws attention to different dimensions of social-ecological systems, with their own unique set of evaluative criteria. Although diversity is generally beneficial for the production of knowledge, it can also pose immense challenges as scholars and practitioners seek to build theoretically rigorous and practically useful knowledge concerning the sustainability of social-ecological systems. Therefore we present a typology which defines and summarizes the three major types of fit and can be used to organize and advance systematic theoretical and policy relevant inquiry.},

title={An integrated analysis of the marine social-ecological system of the Strait of Georgia, Canada, over the past four decades, and development of a regime shift index},

volume={115},

abstract={A Driver-Pressure-State-Impact conceptual model of the Strait of Georgia, Canada, was developed as a framework to characterise the low frequency temporal (regime-like) patterns of variability in this system since 1970, and to identify suitable indicators of these changes. Thirty-seven time series, including both bio-physical ({''}natural{'' and human variables, were assembled with sufficiently few missing years to permit multivariate statistical analyses. Principal component analyses identified regime-like shifts that correspond to those generally accepted for the NE Pacific (late 1970s; mid-1990s), plus an additional shift in the mid-1980s. Redundancy analyses identified significant relationships in which the natural and human explanatory driver/pressure variables accounted for 72\% of the variability of the state/impact response variables. Partitioning this variance among the natural and human drivers/pressures attributed 4\% to the natural drivers/pressures alone and 16\% to the human drivers/pressures alone, but 53\% to the interactions between natural and human drivers and pressures. Both sets of driver and pressure variables (natural and human) are therefore necessary to account for the patterns of variability of the state and impact variables in the Strait of Georgia. Redundancy analysis was also used to identify a reduced set of driver/pressure variables which accounted for a large proportion of the variability in the state and impact response variables: sea surface temperature, wind speed, the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation index, human population surrounding the Strait of Georgia, recreational fishing effort, and the number of hatchery releases of Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) into the Strait. A structural change analysis was used to identify significant changes in these six explanatory variables, and to identify regime shift years (including their 95\% confidence intervals). A regime shift index for the Strait of Georgia was then constructed using a probabilistic causal network model. This model predicted the observed regime shift behaviour with a success rate of >70\%. These six explanatory variables are proposed as leading indicators for low frequency changes (regime shifts) in the Strait of Georgia marine social-ecological system for use within a broader monitoring program.

title={Assessment of Ostrom's social-ecological system framework for the comanagement of small-scale marine fisheries in Colombia: from local fishers' perspectives},

abstract={Fishery resource management under extractive production models in the Anthropocene has contributed to the collapse of fish stocks, threatening the food and livelihood security of many people, especially fishers. Common-pool resource theory has established the relevance of the design principles of Elinor Ostrom, which favor collective actions for the management of these resources. With the help of small-scale fishers, we assessed the state of Ostrom's principles in the study system to determine the conditions required to implement fishery comanagement in the future. The communities of Taganga (Caribbean coast) and Tumaco (Pacific coast), Colombia, served as case studies because of their known dependence on fishing and because both communities are currently facing a social-ecological crisis within their top-down administrative frameworks. We performed six hearings, three in each community in 2009, 2012, and 2014, in which fishers brainstormed about the weaknesses that are closely related to Ostrom's social-ecological system framework. Additionally, 14 focus groups with 119 fishers (31 in Taganga in 2015; 88 in Tumaco in 2017) were conducted, one for each major fishing method used in each community. The obtained results made it possible to establish a community vision on the condition of the principles in each community, and the principles were prioritized by the fishers do determine which ones need immediate attention. The inhabitants of both Taganga and Tumaco expressed the urgent need to establish clear biophysical limits among resource users, to gain the participation of all actors involved, and to build nested enterprises. In particular, the community of Tumaco considered monitoring resources and regulations, establishing graduated sanctions, and recognizing basic rights to be priorities. Furthermore, future opportunities and conflicts related to fishery comanagement implementation were evident in both communities. Therefore, our results indicate that Taganga and Tumaco are not yet ready to implement fishery comanagement. Nevertheless, they have the knowledge and motivation to overcome the obstacles that prevent them from moving forward with managing their fishery resources and to face the tragedy of the commons.},

title={Exploring Values and Beliefs in a Complex Coastal Social-Ecological System: A Case of Small-Scale Fishery and Dried Fish Production in Sagar Island, Indian Sundarbans},

month={DEC 21},
abstract={The survivability of the small-scale fishery and dried fish production in Indian Sundarbans, despite increasing threats posed by climate, environmental, economic, and policy drivers, suggests that they possess certain unique strengths and capabilities. One thread of these strengths is connected to the fact that Sundarbans' fishery system is strongly anchored in the values and beliefs of the local fishing communities. There is, however, limited empirical information available on the prevailing individual and collective attitudes, expectations, traditions, customs, and, above all, values and beliefs that strongly influence local fishing communities of Sundarbans. This manuscript aims to address this gap by drawing on qualitative data to (1) map the nature of values and beliefs associated with the Sundarbans' Sagar Island fishing communities who are engaged in small-scale fishery and dried fish production; and (2) highlight the contributions of values and beliefs to the small-scale fishery and dried fish production systems of Sagar Island. Our study reveals that historical factors such as the patriarchal and patrilineal system prevalent in the Indian Sundarbans as well as the current drivers, including environmental and social-economic changes, create inconsistent values and beliefs among male and female members of its society. Issues around values and beliefs are heavily influenced by social-ecological realities comprising material, relational and subjective dimensions. They can range from being strictly personal to largely community-oriented as they are shaped by realities of gender, class, power dynamics, and politics. Values and beliefs are fundamental to human perception and cognition but often get neglected in mainstream literature covering human dimensions of resource management. Our research adds weight to the theoretical and place-based understanding of the contributions of values and beliefs to the small-scale fishery and dried fish production systems. We learn from the case study that values and beliefs can act as mirrors, reflecting the current as well as future realities of small-scale fisheries and dried fish production systems and provide important directions for sustainability and viability of the entire social-ecological system that hosts this sector.},

title={Linking User-Perception Diversity on Ecosystems Services to the Inception of Coastal Governance Regime Transformation},

volume={7},

pages={NA},
month={FEB 25},
abstract={In this paper we explore the challenges for transforming a wide and fragmented coastal governance system toward an ecosystem-based regime by translating shared values of nature into radically novel territorial development policies at highly disputed seascapes. We report an official coastal management institutional experiment in South Brazil, where direct ecosystem users (fishers, miners, mariculture, tourism and leisure, and aquatic transport agents and researchers) perception and classification of ecosystem services (ES) was assessed during 19 collaborative sectoral workshops held with 178 participants from six coastal cities surrounding Babitonga Bay estuarine and coastal ecosystems (Santa Catarina state, South Brazil). Participants collectively enlisted the benefits, rights and resources (or services) they obtain from these ecosystems, rendering a total of 285 citations coded to conventional ES scientific typologies (127 ES grouped in 5 types and 31 subtypes). We explore patterns in ES classificatory profiles, highlighting ecosystem user's salient identities and exploring how they shape political actions in relation to the implementation of an ecosystem based management regime. Food (provisioning service), tourism/leisure, employment, work and income (cultural services) as well as transportation (e.g. vessels, ports and navigation) (cultural/people's services) are perceived by all user groups, and hence consist the core set of perceived shared values amongst direct ecosystem users to inform future transformation narratives. Differences in perception of values amongst user groups combined with high levels of power asymmetry and fragmentation in decision-making, are steering the analyzed system toward an unsustainable pathway. The governance regime has been largely favoring subsets of services and unfair distribution of benefits, disregarding a more diverse array of real economic interests, and potential ecological knowledge contributions. Our integrative and deliberative ES valuation approach advances understanding of critical features of the scoping phase of ES assessment initiatives in coastal zones. We provide empirically grounded and theoretically informed suggestions for the promotion of local knowledge integration through combination of methods that supports transformational research agendas. This paper establishes new groundwork to fulfilling alternative visions for the regional social-ecological system transformation to a more socially and ecologically coherent and equitable development trajectory.},

abstract={We introduce six steps to define a ``Window of Tipping Point Analysis{''} which serves as a framework to increase the understanding of processes and tipping points in social-ecological systems. We apply the Window of Tipping Point Analysis to a mathematical model and two case studies (i.e., Baltic Sea and the Humboldt Current Upwelling system), focusing on three aspects. In ``to tip or be tipped{''} we look at agency in preventing (or driving) tipping. In ``to be tipped or not to be tipped{''} we discuss intertemporal developments and chosen time periods for delineating regime shifts. In ``to tip or not to tip{''} we discuss the desirability of states and their relation to the elements included. We argue that agency in tipping-point management, the occurrence of tipping points, and desirable states depend on the window chosen for the analysis.},

month={AUG},
abstract={Iceland's fisheries system is well-governed, data-rich, and has adapted to past ecological change. It thus provides an opportunity to identify social-ecological attributes of climate resilience and interactions among them. We elicited barriers and enabling conditions for adaptation in Iceland's fisheries from semi-structured expert interviews, using projections of fish habitat shifts by mid-century to guide discussion. Interviewees highlighted flexible management, highly connected institutions that facilitate learning, ample assets to expand adaptive options, and cultural comfort with change. However, examining how these attributes interact in reinforcing feedback loops revealed potential rigidity traps, where optimization for resilience to stock shifts may render the system more vulnerable to extreme environmental change and social backlash. This study articulates resilience attributes that Iceland and other fisheries systems might prioritize as the climate changes. It further explores circumstances in which these same attributes risk forming traps, and potential pathways to escape them.},

abstract={Management approaches that focus on social-ecological systems-systems comprised of ecosystems, landscapes, and humans-are needed to secure the sustainability of inland recreational fisheries without jeopardizing the integrity of the underlying social and ecological components. Resilience management can be useful because it focuses on providing recreational capacity for fishermen under a variety of conditions while assuring that the social-ecological system is not pushed to a critical threshold that would result in a new, undesired system regime. Resilience management is based on a system perspective that accounts for the possible regimes a system could manifest. It aims to enhance system properties that allow continued maintenance of the system in a desired regime in which multiple goods and services, including recreational capacity, are provided. In this forum paper, we provide an overview of the potential of a resilience approach to the management of recreational fisheries and highlight the scientific and administrative challenges to its successful implementation.

abstract={Inland fisheries are a vital component in the livelihoods and food security of people throughout the world, as well as contributing huge recreational and economic benefits. These valuable assets are jeopardized by lack of research-based understanding of the impacts of fisheries on inland ecosystems, and similarly the impact of human activities associated with inland waters on fisheries and aquatic biodiversity. To explore this topic, an international workshop was organized in order to examine strategies to incorporate fisheries into ecosystem approaches for management of inland waters. To achieve this goal, a new research agenda is needed that focuses on: quantifying the ecosystem services provided by fresh waters; quantifying the economic, social and nutritional benefits of inland fisheries; improving assessments designed to evaluate fisheries exploitation potential; and examining feedbacks between fisheries, ecosystem productivity and aquatic biodiversity. Accomplishing these objectives will require merging natural and social science approaches to address coupled social-ecological system dynamics.},

abstract={Limnology has greatly influenced the field of freshwater fisheries science, particularly fisheries biology. However, both fields became increasingly disconnected during the 20(th) century, when major research traditions within limnology became more tightly focused and humans, even fish, were externalized. A paradigm shift occurring within freshwater fisheries science today is redefining research questions and approaches and is further challenging the role of limnology within fisheries science. Modern fisheries science has become a multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary and sometimes transdisciplinary endeavour that melds the social with the natural sciences to understand fisheries as social-ecological systems. Limnology remains important to capture some of the dynamics inherent in social-ecological fisheries systems, but becomes one of the many necessary scientific disciplines of fisheries science, rather than the primary supporting science that it used to be. To improve scholarly communication between limnologists and freshwater fisheries scientists, major shifts in perspective are needed.},

abstract={This paper presents conclusions and recommendations that emerged from the 7th World Recreational Fishing Conference (WRFC) held in Campinas, Brazil in September 2014. Based on the recognition of the immense social and economic importance of recreational fisheries coupled with weaknesses in robust information about these fisheries in many areas of the world, particularly in many economies in transition, it is recommended to increase effort to build effective governance arrangements and improve monitoring and assessment frameworks in data-poor situations. Moreover, there is a need to increase interdisciplinary studies that will foster a systematic understanding of recreational fisheries as complex adaptive social-ecological systems. To promote sustainable recreational fisheries on a global scale, it is recommended the detailed suggestions for governance and management outlined in the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization Technical Guidelines for Responsible Fisheries: Recreational Fisheries are followed.},

abstract={Research on the interactions between human behaviour and ecological systems tends to focus on the direct effects of human activities on ecosystems, such as biodiversity loss. There is also increasing research effort directed towards ecosystem services. However, interventions to control people's use of the environment alter the incentives that natural resource users face, and therefore their decisions about resource use. The indirect effects of conservation interventions on biodiversity, modulated through human decision-making, are poorly studied but are likely to be significant and potentially counterintuitive. This is particularly so where people are dependent on multiple natural resources for their livelihoods, when both poverty and biodiversity loss are acute. An inter-disciplinary approach is required to quantify these interactions, with an understanding of human decision-making at its core; otherwise, predictions about the impacts of conservation policies may be highly misleading.},

abstract={It is widely recognized that stakeholder engagement processes produce advantages, but few studies acknowledge that they also can produce disadvantages. There is a global need to better assess stakeholder engagement processes by defining success and developing new methods to analyze stakeholder participation data. Our method of digitizing and coding stakeholder communications (1) produces a wide range of analyses, (2) tells the story of governance over time, (3) is comparable with other datasets, and (4) can be used wherever public documents exist. We demonstrate the utility of these integrated methods by examining statewide differences in public participation and success rates in Alaska's Board of Fisheries' (Board) proposal process. We determine that significantly different participation and success rates across the state indicate the existence of disadvantages and the need for further investigation into the equity, efficiency, and effectiveness of the Board process.},

journal={FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS},
year={2021},
volume={5},

month={AUG 12},
abstract={The topic investigated is the social-ecological system of Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) fishing and aquaculture as a tourism product in an era of climate change. Arctic charr is a resilient salmonid species that was traditionally an important part of the sustenance economy in Arctic and Subarctic communities as a source of fresh food throughout the year. Arctic charr populations have declined in recent years, in part due to climate change. These changes in the freshwater ecosystems in turn affect the cultural and economic traditions of freshwater fishing and consumption. This development has consequences for the tourism industry as hunting, fishing and consuming local and traditional food is important in branding tourism destinations. Fisheries are no longer the source of this important ingredient in the Nordic culinary tradition, instead aquaculture production supplies nearly all the Arctic charr consumed. In this paper, we pool the resources of an interdisciplinary team of scholars researching climate change, freshwater ecology, aquaculture and tourism. We integrate knowledge from these fields to discuss likely future scenarios for Arctic charr, their implications for transdisciplinary social ecosystem approaches to sustainable production, marketing and management, particularly how this relates to the growing industry of tourism in the Nordic Arctic and Subarctic region. We pose the questions whether Arctic Charr will be on the menu in 20 years and if so, where will it come from, and what consequences does that have for local food in tourism of the region? Our discussion starts with climate change and the question of how warm it is likely to get in the Nordic Arctic, particularly focusing on Iceland and Norway. To address the implications of the warming of lakes and rivers of the global north for Arctic charr we move on to a discussion of physiological and ecological factors that are important for the distribution of the species. We present the state of the art of Arctic charr aquaculture before articulating the importance of the species for marketing of local and regional food, particularly in the tourism market. Finally, we discuss the need for further elaboration of future scenarios for the interaction of the Arctic charr ecosystem and the economic trade in the species and draw conclusions about sustainable future development.},

Six caletas from different geographic locations in Chiloe Island, southern Chile, served as a model to identify territorial complexity. This article identified 4 criteria and 16 sub-criteria (using Expert Choice software) as suitable descriptors of their complexity, and hierarchically ranked them according to importance (\%). All these variables were merged into a Territorial Complexity Index (ICT), a quali-quantitative estimator of caletas sustainability. A principal Component Analysis, including all sub-criteria, further characterized caletas complexity. This article showed that complexity needs an integrated analysis of the relevant variables to monitor evolutionary trajectories of caletas, and thus ICT is highlighted as a convenient quantitative tool for territorial and strategic planning.},

abstract={Recreational fisheries represent the dominant fisheries sector targeting wild freshwater fishes in all industrialized nations and are becoming increasingly popular in some emerging economies. The socio-economic benefits of recreational fisheries are numerous and substantial. Recreational fisheries through their practices (e.g. overharvest, habitat change, release mortality, stocking and dispersal of non-native fishes), however, have been implicated in negative effects on populations and ecosystems. In inland waters, fish populations also face a variety of threats that are external to the recreational fisheries sector such that recreational fisheries often operate on top of already imperilled resources. This chapter characterizes the scope and magnitude of inland recreational fisheries globally, explores recreational fisheries as a coupled social-ecological system, reviews management strategies, identifies the main issues faced by inland recreational fisheries and discusses the future of recreational fishing in inland waters with an emphasis on research and information needs to ensure their long-term sustainability.},

abstract={Studying social-ecological interactions systematically is difficult when dealing with case study data. The methodological flexibility inherent in case studies facilitates the discovery of complex relationships between social and ecological variables; however, it also poses problems for knowledge accumulation given the diverse ways that variables are measured, as well as the descriptive approaches to causal inference that are typically employed. This article builds on the Social-Ecological Systems Framework (SESF) to systematically compare interactions among variables across case studies. We adopt a `model-centered' meta-analysis of existing SESF case studies, in which the units of analysis are causal explanations including sets of variables and their effects on outcomes (i.e. `models'). Our analysis encompassed 30 studies and resulted in the formalization of 125 models. The analysis illustrates opportunities to assess interactions at different levels of detail . The paper concludes by proposing strategies to advance the study and reporting of interactions in case studies to foster a better understanding of dynamics and outcomes of environmental sustainability.},

abstract={The ability of resource-dependent communities to adapt to climate change depends in part on their perceptions and prioritization of specific climate-related threats. In the Maine lobster fishery, which is highly vulnerable to warming water associated with climate change, we found a strong majority (84\%) of fishers viewed warming water as a threat, but rank its impacts lower than other drivers of change (e.g., pollution). Two-thirds believed they will be personally affected by warming waters, but only half had plans to adapt. Those with adaptation plans demonstrated fundamentally different views of human agency in this system, observing greater anthropogenic threats, but also a greater ability to control the fishery through their own actions on the water and fisheries management processes. Lack of adaptation planning was linked to the view that warming waters result from natural cycles, and the expectation that technological advancements will help buffer the industry from warming waters.},

volume={45},

pages={230-240},

abstract={The gooseneck barnacle fishery in Asturias (N. Spain) has undergone three important changes: (1) the early implementation of a co-management system based on Territorial User Rights for Fishing, (2) a change in management measures (due to a decrease in landings), and (3) an economic crisis. This has allowed us to analyze the systems' sustainability in time through examining five critical variables: landings, effort, catch per unit effort (CPUE), mean market prices, and annual revenue. Additionally, we used focus groups and questionnaires to determine the response of the system to these three changes. Co-management has succeeded in maintaining or increasing CPUE throughout all management areas and produced stable mean market prices. This was achieved through flexible management policies and adaptive strategies adopted by the fishers, such as increased selectivity and diversification. The analysis of this fishery provides important lessons regarding the need to understand the evolutionary dynamics of co-management and the importance of embracing adaptive capacity.},

abstract={The impact of Hurricane Sandy on the Hudson-Raritan estuary (HRE) provided a valuable case study for exploring interactions between long-term environmental degradation, new climatic disturbance stressors, and human behavioral responses. We extend previous research on the ecological effects of major storms to compare water quality and biological parameters three years before and three years after Hurricane Sandy and consider how ecosystem shifts relate to anglers' perceptions. Results indicate that water clarity and nutrients returned to pre-storm conditions in about one year, while shifts in the biological community, including a significant increase in harmful algal species and declines in zooplankton and Atlantic menhaden, persisted for multiple years, and anglers continued to fish amidst ecosystem decline. Biotic recovery time in the HRE was longer than reports for other shallow estuaries frequently disturbed by hurricanes. Ecological and social responses suggest that the post-storm regime shifts and continued fishing pressure could further environmental degradation.},

abstract={Invertebrate gleaning is a small-scale fishery that commonly occurs in the intertidal zone across the tropical Indo-Pacific. In this study, we investigated and analyzed several components of this fishery on the island of Unguja, Zanzibar by employing the social-ecological systems framework from Ostrom 2009. In doing so, we conducted ecological surveys, catch assessments, interviews with gleaners, household surveys, focus group interviews and analyzed the governance structure. This social-ecological systems analysis showed that gleaning is important for food security, local culture and livelihood. Yet, the multiple approaches in our study revealed that the local intertidal zone is degrading and that the gleaned catch is changing. Local narratives indicate that economically important bivalves (Modiolus spp.) and gastropods (Strombus spp.) are in decline, which was paralleled with low abundances of both genera within the ecological survey of the intertidal and catch landing assessment. We recommend that invertebrate gleaning, a fishery mainly comprised of women should be included in fisheries management.},

abstract={The Cienaga Grande of Santa Marta is Colombia's largest coastal wetland and one of the most important in the Caribbean. In this paper we evaluate the complex linkages existing among the social-ecological history, provision of ecosystem services and human well-being as perceived by local stakeholders. The most critical anthropogenic impacts occurred during the last 50 years in the period following the construction of the Cienaga-Barranquilla highway. The changes to the social-ecological system have severely altered hydrological dynamics, reduced mangrove forest coverage and affected the composition of fisheries, with direct and indirect effects on the ecosystem services provision and on the well-being of the local people. Despite the ambitious restoration programmes put in practice during the last two decades, the social-ecological impacts of large infrastructure developments are visible today. The paper offers insights that can improve environmental decision making and promote adaptive governance in coastal wetlands.},

journal={ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},

pages={NA},
month={JUN},
abstract={Local users may invest in managing common pool resources, thereby promoting social and ecological resilience. Institutional or economic limits on access are regarded as essential preconditions for incentivizing local investments, but we show that investment incentives can exist even under open access. We modeled a recreational harvest fishery in which local or centralized managers invest in fish stocking to maximize social welfare. Although classic open access dissipation of rents occurs at equilibrium, the sluggish response of fishing effort to changing conditions allows welfare to accrue in transition to equilibrium. This transient welfare creates persistent incentives to invest. Empirical observations showed that stocking by local collective action groups occurred at rates similar to model-predicted optima, while centralized stocking occurred at rates greater than predicted optima. Our results emphasize the potential benefits of local involvement in managing the commons, even under conditions that were previously thought to preclude effective collective action.},

abstract={Populations in resource dependent economies gain well-being from the natural environment, in highly spatially and temporally variable patterns. To collect information on this, we designed and implemented a 1586-household quantitative survey in the southwest coastal zone of Bangladesh. Data were collected on material, subjective and health dimensions of well-being in the context of natural resource use, particularly agriculture, aquaculture, mangroves and fisheries. The questionnaire included questions on factors that mediate poverty outcomes: mobility and remittances; loans and micro-credit; environmental perceptions; shocks; and women's empowerment. The data are stratified by social-ecological system to take into account spatial dynamics and the survey was repeated with the same respondents three times within a year to incorporate seasonal dynamics. The dataset includes blood pressure measurements and height and weight of men, women and children. In addition, the household listing includes basic data on livelihoods and income for approximately 10,000 households. The dataset facilitates interdisciplinary research on spatial and temporal dynamics of well-being in the context of natural resource dependence in low income countries.},

abstract={We report on outcomes and lessons learned from a 15-month initiative in Cambodia's Tonle Sap Lake. Employing the appreciation-influence-control (AIC) model of participatory stakeholder engagement, the initiative built shared understanding of the sources of vulnerability in fisheries livelihoods and catalyzed collective action to support resilience in this valuable and productive social-ecological system. Outcomes include the transfer of a large, commercial fishing concession to community access, and resolution of a boundary dispute involving community fishery organizations in neighboring provinces. Motivated by these successes, the main national grassroots network representing fishing communities also modified its internal governance and strategy of engagement to emphasize constructive links with government and the formal NGO sector. The AIC approach, we argue, provides an effective route to enable collective action in ways that strengthen dialogue and collaboration across scales, fostering the conditions for local-level transformations that can contribute to improvement in governance. We conclude with a discussion of the broader implications for resilience practice.},

abstract={This study investigates the status and anthropogenic pressures on seagrass ecosystem. Urbanization and tourism in the coastal areas of Bintan, Indonesia were increasing in the recent years. They have become new pressures to intertidal ecosystem and habitats, particularly seagrass ecosystem. Seagrass meadows are the important ecosystem and habitats in Bintan region. They provide a wide range of ecosystem services, including for small-scale fisheries and have being Dugongs (Dugong dugon) habitats for food. Currently, the sea grass status is less healthy or damaged with 11 species. The anthropogenic disturbance processes have affected the spatial distribution, percent coverage, biodiversity, and community structure of sea grass. Moreover, several species are hard to find. Directly, sea grass meadows are impacted by introduced coastal development (i.e. settlement area, tourism accommodation, port, etc.), land-based pollution, reclamation, boating traffic, dredging activities and tourism activities. Sea grass conservation area and marine spatial planning based on the land-and seascape connectivity is important for conservation efforts and sustainable management of sea grass.},

abstract={The first relatively complete landscape-scale social-ecological system (SES) model of a recreational fishery was developed and ground-truthed with independent angling effort data. Based on the British Columbia multistock recreational fishery for rainbow trout (Oncorynchus mykiss), the model includes hundreds of individual lake fisheries, hundreds of thousands of anglers, originating from tens of communities, connected by complex road and trail networks, all distributed over a landscape of approximately half a million square kilometres. The approach is unique in that it incorporates realistic and empirically derived behavioural interactions within and among the three key components of the SES: angler communities, fish populations, and management policies. Current management policies were characterized and alternate policies assessed by simulation. We examined spatial patterns in ecological and social properties of the SES and used simulations to investigate the impacts of alternate management policies on these patterns. Simulation outcomes strongly depended on the spatial redistribution of anglers across the landscape, existing road networks, heterogeneity in angler behaviours, and the spatial pattern of fish population productivity.},

abstract={The COVID-19 pandemic transformed social and economic systems globally, including fisheries systems. Decreases in seafood demand, supply chain disruptions, and public safety regulations required numerous adaptations to maintain the livelihoods and social resilience of fishing communities. Surveys, interviews, and focus groups were undertaken to assess impacts from and adaptive responses to the pandemic in commercial fisheries in five U.S. regions: the Northeast, California, Alaska, the U.S. Caribbean, and the Pacific Islands. Fishery adaptation strategies were categorized using the Resist-Accept-Direct (RAD) framework, a novel application to understand social transformation in a social-ecological system in response to a disturbance. A number of innovations emerged, or were facilitated, that could improve the fisheries' resilience to future disruptions. Fishers with diversified options and strategic flexibility generally fared better, i.e., had fewer disruptions to their livelihoods. Using the RAD framework to identify adaptation strategies from fishery system actors highlights opportunities for improving resilience of fisheries social-ecological systems to future stressors.},

abstract={Understanding tipping point dynamics in harvested ecosystems is of crucial importance for sustainable resource management because ignoring their existence imperils social-ecological systems that depend on them. Fisheries collapses provide the best known examples for realizing tipping points with catastrophic ecological, economic and social consequences. However, present-day fisheries management systems still largely ignore the potential of their resources to exhibit such abrupt changes towards irreversible low productive states. Using a combination of statistical changepoint analysis and stochastic cusp modelling, here we show that Western Baltic cod is beyond such a tipping point caused by unsustainable exploitation levels that failed to account for changing environmental conditions. Furthermore, climate change stabilizes a novel and likely irreversible low productivity state of this fish stock that is not adapted to a fast warming environment. We hence argue that ignorance of non-linear resource dynamics has caused the demise of an economically and culturally important social-ecological system which calls for better adaptation of fisheries systems to climate change.},

abstract={Recent scholarship has focused attention on the dynamics and management of marine social ecological systems and on the need for developing a deeper understanding of the fishing strategies of fish harvesters. This includes an understanding of how a broad range of factors influence the strategies of those at the `center' of marine social-ecological interactions. This paper reports on the findings of a survey of snow crab (Chionoecetes opilio) fishers in Southeastern Labrador conducted at a time (2005) of significant stress in the fishery. Results highlight that snow crab fishers are embedded in a social-ecological system and that shifts in fishing strategies in times of stress are a product of adapting to a dynamic, interactive set of factors that have social, economic, ecological and management aspects. Important differences between fleet sectors (larger and smaller vessels) as well as processes of learning are also described. The article concludes with a discussion of the implications for management and the utility of a holistic socialecological perspective. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Resource managers and policy makers have long recognized the importance of considering fisheries in the context of ecosystems; yet, movement towards widespread Ecosystem-based Fisheries Management (EBFM) has been slow. A conceptual reframing of fisheries management is occurring globally, which envisions fisheries as systems with interacting biophysical and human subsystems. This broader view, along with a process for decision making, can facilitate implementation of EBFM. A pathway to achieve these broadened objectives of EBFM in the United States is a Fishery Ecosystem Plan (FEP). The first generation of FEPs was conceived in the late 1990s as voluntary guidance documents that Regional Fishery Management Councils could adopt to develop and guide their ecosystem-based fisheries management decisions, but few of these FEPs took concrete steps to implement EBFM. Here, we emphasize the need for a new generation of FEPs that provide practical mechanisms for putting EBFM into practice in the United States. We argue that next-generation FEPs can balance environmental, economic, and social objectivesthe triple bottom lineto improve long-term planning for fishery systems.},

abstract={The ecosystem approach is a salient policy paradigm originating from a scientific understanding of the reality of complex ecosystem dynamics. In this article, we investigate how Swedish national marine policies and practice between 2002 and 2015 have changed towards an ecosystem approach. Government documents, the scientific literature, institutional changes, changes in legislation, pilot projects, and changes in science and public opinion were reviewed and combined with information from expert interviews. We found that changes in policy and practice have slowly stimulated the development of an ecosystem approach, but that limited political leadership, challenges of coordination, different agency cultures, and limited learning appears to be key barriers for further and more substantial change. We compare and contrast the Swedish national process of change with other documented experiences of implementing an ecosystem approach and find that several countries struggle with similar challenges. Substantial work still remains in Sweden and we provide suggestions for how to stimulate further and more substantial change at the national level.},

abstract={This paper investigates the ecological-economic sustainability of coral reef socio-ecological systems under fishing and environmental pressures. To achieve this, a dynamic, spatially explicit, multi-species, multi-fleet fisheries model is developed. Stochastic environmental shocks are assumed to alter coral cover and consequently the entire coral reef social-ecological system. The model is calibrated using ecological, socio-economic and environmental data in French Polynesia. Four exploratory fishing strategies and a goal-seeking strategy entitled Stochastic Multi-Species Maximum Sustainable Yield (SMMSY) are compared in terms of ecological-economic outcomes and sustainability of the socio-ecological system. The SMMSY turns out to promote ecological-economic sustainability. It is characterised by a global increase in fishing effort pointing to the relative current under-exploitation of the fishery. SMMSY balances the trophic level of catches after natural shocks and sustains the fundamental herbivore grazing process. SMMSY strategies are also more diversified in terms of temporality, gears, spatial distribution of fishing and target species.},

abstract={Since the 1990s, the overexploitation of marine resources has led to the degradation of the fisheries' social-ecological systems (SES). In response to these collapses, scientific fishery studies have tried to develop multiple approaches to improve sustainability of the systems. The purpose of this study is to understand how the scientific literature conceives of the conceptual responses of the fisheries systems to social-ecological changes. Our research, based on a systematic literature review, builds a conceptual framework and highlights the level of importance scientific discourse which has conferred to the notions of uncertainty, resilience, adaptation, and governance in a context of changes in fisheries. The scientific discourse emphasizes relevant paradigms such as social and environmental justice associated with the distribution of resources, consideration of ecological knowledge, and the value associated with marine resources. Conversely, scientific discourse only marginally considers notions of equity, the ecosystem approach, and precaution. In addition to highlighting scientific paradigms framing fisheries systems in the face of social-ecological changes, this study discusses the influence of scientific knowledge-building mechanisms on scientific discourse.},

abstract={The concept of social-ecological knowledge diversity (SEKD) provides a novel way of examining coupled human-environment interactions-it acknowledges differences in knowledge, values, and beliefs of stakeholder groups within social-ecological systems (SES). Thus, understanding and measuring SEKD is an essential component of sustainable management with implications for conflict resolution, collective action and policymaking. However, methods to efficiently define and model knowledge diversity are still underdeveloped. Using a semiquantitative cognitive mapping approach, we collected and analyzed stakeholder-specific knowledge and perceptions of the Western Baltic cod fishery to model SEKD. Results demonstrate substantial variation in perceptions across different individuals and social groups. SEKD was evident in (a) distinctive meanings attached to social factors relative to ecological factors, (b) causal relationships underlying the understanding of SES dynamics, and (c) social impacts of ecological changes on ecosystems (and vice versa). By identifying and representing knowledge-specific disparities in SES frameworks, our model explicitly improves the understanding of human-environment interactions with implications that could help reduce conflicts and legitimize management plans.},

abstract={Quantitative models for marine ecosystem-based management are often constrained by availability of observations. Uncertainty about the underlying system structure can affect model estimates and conclusions about the consequences of management actions. Qualitative models can augment model development for decision-making and may provide an alternative to quantitative assessments. We apply qualitative loop analysis to assess the sensitivity of management outcomes to structural uncertainty within the Georges Bank social-ecological system. Loop analysis uses defined positive or negative relationships between system components to provide inference about cascading effects of pressures on components of management interest. We compare the sensitivity of outcomes from two management strategies in four model structures of the Georges Bank system that investigate trophic and socioeconomic model uncertainty. We summarize system responses to perturbation and compare these responses with a set of management objectives. Models with complex socioeconomic structure estimated positive outcomes more often but with less reliability than simpler models. Our analyses demonstrated trade-offs among habitat objectives for two management strategies, as well as uncertainty about the reliability of outcomes, contingent on model structure.},

abstract={Ecosystem services and the biodiversity that supports them directly provision food and livelihoods to millions around the world within environments increasingly facing multifaceted changes. Yet the perspectives of resource users on the value of those resources and the challenges they face amid social-ecological change are still too often poorly understood. In this study, we use Photovoice methodology and a social-ecological systems perspective to understand the value of access to fish resources and the impacts of changing access for small-scale fishing communities in Cambodia. Contrasting the perspectives of households in different ecological settings, including adjacent to the Tonle Sap Lake and within its floodplain, revealed stark differences in the experiences of regulation enforcement and fisheries management for communities that had viable alternatives to fishing compared to those without options beyond fishing. The study addresses the need to understand both the lived experiences of those on the frontlines of environmental changes, and to disentangle the heterogeneous experiences across and within communities to improve resource management and community support in complex, changing social-ecological systems.},

abstract={International interest in increasing marine protected area (MPA) coverage reflects broad recognition of the MPA as a key tool for marine ecosystems and fisheries management. Nevertheless, effective management remains a significant challenge. The present study contributes to enriching an understanding of best practices for MPA management through analysis of archived community survey data collected in the Philippines by the Learning Project (LP), a collaboration with United States Coral Triangle Initiative (USCTI), United States Agency for International Development (USAID), and partners. We evaluate stakeholder participation and social ecological interactions among resource users in MPA programs in the Palawan, Occidental Mindoro, and Batangas provinces in the Philippines. Analysis indicates that a complex suite of social ecological factors, including demographics, conservation beliefs, and scientifically correct knowledge influence participation, which in turn is related to perceived MPA performance. Findings indicate positive feedbacks within the system that have potential to strengthen perceptions of MPA success. The results of this evaluation provide empirical reinforcement to current inquiries concerning the role of participation in influencing MPA performance.},

abstract={Worldwide there is an increasing realisation that there is an inextricable link between the natural and human systems, and there is a need to integrate these into the governance of small-scale fisheries. The critical importance of adopting such an approach is argued in this paper by exploring the challenge of resource over-exploitation in the abalone fishery in South Africa and the loco fishery in Chile, both of which faced unsuccessful fishery closures and the implementation of Territorial Use Rights in Fisheries (TURFs). By exploring similarities and differences in fisheries context and approaches, these case studies highlight that although management strategies have been progressive on paper, they are compromised, to different degrees, by a lack of understanding of the socio-economic and political factors that are influencing the fisheries system. We argue that unless a more integrated approach is adopted to understand the social-ecological system as a whole, few long-term benefits will be secured for both the resources and the livelihoods of fishers},

abstract={This interdisciplinary paper presents an empirical analysis of techno-institutional lock-in in a regional fishery, in the Logone floodplain in the Far North Region of Cameroon. In the Logone floodplain, one fishing technique is spreading exponentially even though it is changing the social, hydrological and ecological dynamics of the system in ways that are largely considered problematic by local communities. We use a complex systems framework to analyze large hydrological and socio-economic datasets. Results show how social-ecological feedbacks foster the spread of the technique and contribute to the process of lock-in. The lock-in leads to a resistance to change despite awareness of the technique's impact, a situation that may also be described as a social-ecological trap. We identify and explain four kinds of positive feedback loops relating to socio-economic, behavioral, demographic and hydrological processes, respectively. We also identify possible solutions that consider the complexity of the feedback loops across multiple dimensions of the floodplain system. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={In September 2015, the United Nations approved the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development that includes 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and 169 SDG target. Recently, a line of research has emerged to study the importance of fisheries governance at various geographic levels for the social, economic and environmental development of the planet. This document studies what changes in fisheries are necessary to achieve the SDGs. For this, it is important to know how the images that stakeholders have about their governance. The images allow us to describe sustainability challenges, explain why governments take a certain decision, and learn about people's motivations to act in favour of sustainability. Using fishing in the Region of Murcia as a case study, this work analyses the images of various groups and their relationship to the SDGs. The results show a wide variety of images and thematic areas related with 84 SDG targets. Furthermore, the document analyses how the image management can facilitate the implement the SDGs in the fisheries and it offers three implications for improving its governance.},

abstract={While women globally make up nearly half of the fisheries workforce, their contribution to the sector has long been overlooked with implications for fisheries management. To assess women's participation in small-scale fisheries (SSF) management and related socio-cultural, environmental, and economic impacts, we conducted a systematic review of peer-reviewed literature (n = 124 case studies). Women had no or limited participation in more than 80\% of the examined case studies reporting their participation level in SSF management. Women's exclusion from SSF management resulted in negative outcomes, whereas their active participation was associated with various positive impacts at multiple scales. Most of the documented impacts were socio-cultural, suggesting a gap in documenting environmental impacts stemmed from women's participation in SSF management. Importantly, most impacts reported affected the social-ecological system scale, suggesting that gender inclusion may contribute to improving the management of SSF social-ecological systems. We conclude by highlighting the need to foster gender perspectives in data collection methods used in fisheries research, in SSF management, and in ecological research on SSF social-ecological systems.},

abstract={A common pattern of environmental crises is a vicious cycle between environmental degradation and socioeconomic disturbances. Here we show that while such feedbacks may give rise to critical transitions in social-ecological systems, at the same time they can offer novel opportunities for anticipating them. We model a community that has joint access to the harvest grounds of a resource that is prone to collapse. Individuals are tempted to overexploit the resource, while a cooperative harvesting norm spreads through the community via interpersonal relations. Both social and ecological collapses can be induced by environmental or socio-economic driving forces. Regardless of the type and cause of collapse we find that upcoming transitions may be detected using simple socio-economic response variables, such as individual profits. Our findings suggest that such alternative sources of information can be used to detect upcoming critical transitions in social-ecological systems. However, we also find that robust detection of critical transitions may be confounded by recovery attempts undertaken by resource users in the vicinity of an upcoming collapse, which may be falsely interpreted as a stabilization of the social-ecological system.

journal={JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING},
year={2020},
volume={8},

pages={NA},
month={OCT},
abstract={By employing empirical and secondary data (qualitative and quantitative), this study demonstrates how social equity (with its three dimensions) can meaningfully address the conservation of the coastal social-ecological system (SES), without losing diverse ecosystem services (ES) in south-east coastal Bangladesh. Based on this proposition, this study assesses the available ES and identifies the drivers responsible for ES changes, arguing for the application of social equity for resource conservation. The findings show that communities along Bangladesh's south-eastern coast use several ES for food, medicine, income, livelihoods, and cultural heritage. However, this valuable ecosystem is currently experiencing numerous threats and stressors of anthropogenic and natural origin. In particular, large-scale development activities, driven by the blue growth agenda, and neoliberalism policy, pose a risk to the local communities by degrading coastal ecosystem services. Escaping this situation for coastal natural resource-dependent communities in Bangladesh will require a transformation in the governance structure. Implementing the Small-Scale Fisheries (SSF) Guidelines that call for initiating policy change to deliver social justice to small-scale fisheries would help to address coastal ecosystem service conservation in Bangladesh.},

abstract={In this period of environmental change, understanding how resource users respond to such changes is critical for effective resource management and adaptation planning. Extensive work has focused on natural resource responses to environmental changes, but less has examined the response of resource users to such changes. We used an interdisciplinary approach to analyse changes in resource use among commercial trawl fishing communities in the northwest Atlantic, a region that has shown poleward shifts in harvested fish species. We found substantial community-level changes in fishing patterns since 1996: southern trawl fleets of larger vessels with low catch diversity fished up to 400 km further north, while trawl fleets of smaller vessels with low catch diversity shrank or disappeared from the data set over time. In contrast, trawl fleets (of both large and small vessels) with higher catch diversity neither changed fishing location dramatically or nor disappeared as often from the data set. This analysis suggests that catch diversity and high mobility may buffer fishing communities from effects of environmental change. Particularly in times of rapid and uncertain change, constructing diverse portfolios and allowing for fleet mobility may represent effective adaptation strategies.},

abstract={In the Western Indian Ocean (WIO) region, information and data on marine recreational fisheries (MRF) is lacking, which undermines efforts towards their sustainable development. Our paper reviews the challenges and opportunities for sustainably developing marine recreational fisheries in the WIO. We identified several challenges that are discussed in two broad categories: (i) governance and (ii) socio-cultural and economic. We also show that addressing these challenges requires a holistic understanding of the socio-ecological complexities and the multi-scale nature of WIO MRF. Realizing the potential for sustainable development of this sector calls for the involvement of coastal communities in the sharing of benefits and decision-making. Further, coordinated efforts between the multi-government agencies and non-governmental organizations is critical for integrating recreational fisheries into local and national agendas. We conclude that the sustainable development of MRF in the WIO region is possible. Still, such growth will be dependent upon the sustained capacity building of coastal communities and indigenous fishers, collaboration from stakeholders, and the long-term sustainability of the resource.},

abstract={We assessed the relative contribution of a set of predictors on the short-term dynamics of the yellow clam intertidal fishery in Uruguay based on a community-based data collection program for five consecutive fishing seasons. Results of generalized linear mixed models showed that the occurrence of fishable days depends on the absence of red tide events and prevailing wind conditions, but also was related to the timing of each fishing event throughout the fishing season. Furthermore, higher fishing yields were coincident with the prevalence of northerly offshore winds. Catch per unit of effort levels of each fishing event were mostly related to interannual characteristics of each fishing season and, to a lesser extent, with fisher attributes (gender and age) and the timing of each fishing event. The adverse effect of red tides and unfavorable environmental conditions impose a high degree of uncertainty in this social-ecological system, leading to economic inefficiency. A key challenge for successful management of the yellow clam fishery and other similar small-scale fisheries relies in considering not only the resource and the governance subsystems, but also the dynamics of the resource users, together with relevant external drivers affecting them.},

abstract={Based on research conducted by myself and colleagues as part of the Southern Cape Interdisciplinary Fisheries Research Project, I present an overview of residents' perspectives on the Stilbaai Marine Protected Area, located on the Southern Cape coast of South Africa. Currently, South Africa's marine governance sector is often fraught with politicking, inefficiencies, and other effects that strain the social-ecological system. This research shows that despite some fragmentation of governance, there are opportunities, and a general willingness, to engage in activities that take care of the local environment on the behalf of residents, that serve to educate about ocean-positive behaviours and engage visitors more meaningfully on the benefits and value of the Stilbaai Marine Protected Area. Problems that residents perceive to be associated with the Marine Protected Area are noted, and suggestions are made to enhance a sense of caretaking, or sorgskap, within the community to fill the gaps of certain governance or regulation inadequacies. Indeed, I argue that in lieu of efficient formal governance structures and collaborations, it is the informal characteristic of caretaking activities by the community that renders these activities more sustainable, long term, and effective in building a ``culture{''} of caretaking.},

abstract={Artisanal fishery activities support the livelihoods of millions of people worldwide, particularly in developing countries. Within these fisheries, distal global drivers can promote switching between alternative target resources. These drivers can promote the rapid development of new, unregulated and previously unexploited fisheries that pose a threat to the sustainability of ecosystems. In this paper, we describe a new artisanal shore gathering activity that targets a previously unexploited resource: the sandhopper (Orchestoidea tuberculata). The activity is driven by aquarium trade demand for food. We used mixed methods to describe the activity, assessed basic socio-economic incentives, and estimated Catches per Unit Effort. Results show that the sandhopper plays an important role for the livelihoods of shore gatherers engaged in the activity. Gatherers have adapted and developed two main extraction methods with different degrees of investment and extraction rates. Furthermore, gatherers have developed local knowledge regarding the ecology and management of the resource. Results show that economic incentives can motivate a rapid expansion of this unregulated activity. Future research gaps and management options to address the development of this fishery are discussed in light of these findings.},

abstract={In Easter Island, most of fisheries regulations are top-down implemented by the central fisheries authority located 4000 km eastwards. This could generate problems in regulations compliance, given the cultural differences between the western worldview and Polynesian culture of Easter Island. A total of 18 issues that must be considered previously to an intervention in the island were identified. Four of them scored the highest difference between Rapanui and public services representatives. Among them, ``Integrating traditions and culture{'' had a little priority for the public services representatives, but was the most important for the Rapanui. According to the public services representatives in Easter Island and local fishermen, there is a little compliance with regulations related to fisheries and, due to cultural aspects, it is not possible to enforce regulations and apply sanctions. The low compliance with fisheries regulations is due to the lack of representativeness of regulations. Interventions in the island are based on western worldview that does not fit with social and ecological domains of social-ecological system. A flexible governance system, based on decision making at local level in line with local tradition is needed to navigate to a resource management and conservation in Easter Island.},

abstract={Oysters are one of the main aquatic products produced in Taiwan. However, because of the gradual changes in the environment of the Waisanding Sandbar, the oyster farming environment along the coast of Chiayi is shrinking, leading to greater operational risk and uncertainty. This study adopted a three-stage method to investigate the socioeconomic uncertainty that fishing communities face regarding environmental changes and to understand the environmental risk and fishery management awareness of different stakeholders as well as their views on adaptation strategies. In-depth interviews were used in the first stage. In Stage 2, two-round focus group interviews were conducted to organize views on the environment and climate, the oyster industry and management, and adaptation strategies. In the final stage, the AHP method was adopted to analyze the opinions of different stakeholders. The results showed factors affecting environmental change, oyster industry, and management among different stakeholders as well as the cognitive differences within the corresponding adaptation strategies. Therefore, socioeconomic and ecology complexities and uncertainties should be considered for enhancing social capital and promoting risk communication, more diverse social-ecological system data to assist fishery governance, and oyster industry development and adaptation strategies.},

abstract={Effective conservation of species requires an understanding of both the ecological characteristics of threats to the species in question, as well as the social and governance context of those threats. However, data on such characteristics and context are often lacking. This paper proposes the conservationscape framework as a guide for filling these data gaps, through interdisciplinary research that links species-focused conservation to a broader, human-inclusive understanding of threats and possible solutions. This framework, adapted from other social-ecological system frameworks, outlines (1) basic characteristics of species and the threats they face, (2) social factors (including economic and cultural factors) that influence human activities linked to these threats, and (3) governance context, or how human activities are managed (eg through regulations or institutions). The accidental capture, or bycatch, of marine mammals - specifically, Irrawaddy dolphins (Orcaella brevirostris) - by small-scale fisheries offers a practical example of how this framework can be used to develop a holistic understanding of conservation threats and possible solutions. For many conservation issues, this framework could help provide critical information, elucidate patterns and priorities through cross-site comparisons, and reduce the gap between research and effective conservation by informing solutions that integrate the human dimension.},

abstract={In the midst of a global fisheries crisis, there has been great interest in the fostering of adaptation and resilience in fisheries, as a means to reduce vulnerability and improve the capacity of fishing society to adapt to change. However, enhanced resilience does not automatically result in improved well-being of people, and adaptation strategies are riddled with difficult choices, or trade-offs, that people must negotiate. This paper uses the context of fisheries to explore some apparent tensions between adapting to change on the one hand, and the pursuit of well-being on the other, and illustrates that trade-offs can operate at different levels of scale. It argues that policies that seek to support fisheries resilience need to be built on a better understanding of the wide range of consequences that adaptation has on fisher well-being, the agency people exert in negotiating their adaptation strategies, and how this feeds back into the resilience of fisheries as a social-ecological system. The paper draws from theories on agency and adaptive preferences to illustrate how agency might be better incorporated into the resilience debate.},

abstract={The land-sea interface is a complex social-ecological system characterized by natural ecological processes and human-induced changes. Holistic management of the shoreline is a critical element of an ecosystem-based approach to the land-sea interface in coastal zone management (CZM) programs. Anthropogenic alteration of shoreline environments has resulted in significant loss of sandy beach ecosystems and eroded the resilience of these systems to disturbance. We tested the efficacy of CZM programs in managing the land-sea interface under current and future challenges by comparing alternative approaches to shoreline management in two U. S. states (Hawai'i and North Carolina). Our results show that explicit prohibition of shoreline armoring has been more effective in conserving dynamic coastal environments and communities by passing the risk associated with coastal development from the public trust to private landowners. Over the long-term, robust anti-armoring legislation will de-incentivize risky coastal development projects while preserving coastal environments and the ecological services they provide to society. Policy prescriptions for effective shoreline management and increased coastal resilience under persistent coastal erosion and future sea-level rise are proposed.},

abstract={Oyster harvest has long been an important industry of the eastern coast of the United States. However, coastal development, overfishing and climate change are threatening this industry and way of life. This study examines the perspectives of oyster harvesters and merchants in Brunswick County, North Carolina, USA to explore their capacity to adapt to these changing conditions. Using in-person, semi-structured interviews researchers collected information from seventeen interviewees, generating qualitative data that were analyzed using MAXQDA software. From the data collected several themes emerged revealing mixed sentiments on the impacts of climate change but a widespread sense that development and regulations threaten livelihoods and cultural heritage. This social-ecological system (SES), created through centuries of regulation, is experiencing rapid population growth with concurrent coastal development; it also includes oyster industry workers who have limited voice in decision-making but are affected by the political ecology of the region. Deliberately including oyster harvesters and merchants when formulating and implementing policy can help to strengthen the adaptive capacity of this SES while sustaining Brunswick County's coastal heritage.

abstract={Climate change is increasingly impacting marine fisheries worldwide. Concurrently, scientific interest has grown to understand how these systems can cope and adapt, with research shifting from examining vulnerability to assessing risks to focusing on determining and operationalizing resilience. As fisheries-climate-resilience researchers and practitioners navigating a sea of frameworks, toolkits, strategies, policy goals, and management desires, we take stock to ask: what does resilience mean to us? Drawing on our experiences in the northeast United States, we discuss the challenges and ambiguity we encounter in concepts of social-ecological resilience and explore implications for research and implementation. We bring together perspectives to discuss various approaches to resilience, highlighting shared and unique challenges we face. We outline three key considerations as we move forward in resilience research and practice: (1) the need for greater transparency and reflexivity among researchers regarding how they frame and approach resilience; (2) the value of increasing coordination and communication among fisheries groups working on these topics; and (3) the use of co-developed and co-produced resilience research and strategies. We urge for greater centring of communities in these discussions and to explicitly consider how resilience interacts with equity outcomes.},

journal={ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
year={2017},
volume={22},
number={4},
pages={NA},
month={NA},
abstract={Management actions often need to be taken in the absence of ecological information to mitigate the impact of pressing environmental problems. Managers counteracted the detrimental effects of cultural acidification on aquatic ecosystems during the industrial era using liming to salvage biodiversity and ecosystem services. However, historical contingencies, i.e., whether lakes were naturally acidic or degraded because of acidification, were largely unknown and therefore not accounted for in management. It is uncertain whether liming outcomes had a potentially detrimental effect on naturally acidic lakes. Evidence from paleolimnological reconstructions allowed us to analyze community structure in limed acidified and naturally acidic lakes, and acidified and circumneutral references. We analyzed community structure of phytoplankton, zooplankton, macroinvertebrates (littoral, sublittoral, profundal), and fish between 2000 and 2004. Naturally acidic limed lakes formed communities that were not representative of the other lake types. The occurrence of fish species relevant for ecosystem service provisioning (fisheries potential) in naturally acidic limed lakes were confounded by biogeographical factors. In addition, sustained changes in water quality were conducive to harmful algal blooms. This highlights a pathological outcome of liming lakes when their naturally acidic conditions are not accounted for. Because liming is an important social-ecological system, sustained ecological change of lakes might incur undesired costs for societies in the long term.},

abstract={Regime shifts triggered by human activities and environmental changes have led to significant ecological and socioeconomic consequences in marine and terrestrial ecosystems worldwide. Ecological processes and feedbacks associated with regime shifts have received considerable attention, but human individual and collective behavior is rarely treated as an integrated component of such shifts. Here, we used generalized modeling to develop a coupled social-ecological model that integrated rich social and ecological data to investigate the role of social dynamics in the 1980s Baltic Sea cod boom and collapse. We showed that psychological, economic, and regulatory aspects of fisher decision making, in addition to ecological interactions, contributed both to the temporary persistence of the cod boom and to its subsequent collapse. These features of the social-ecological system also would have limited the effectiveness of stronger fishery regulations. Our results provide quantitative, empirical evidence that incorporating social dynamics into models of natural resources is critical for understanding how resources can be managed sustainably. We also show that generalized modeling, which is well-suited to collaborative model development and does not require detailed specification of causal relationships between system variables, can help tackle the complexities involved in creating and analyzing social-ecological models.},

abstract={Commercial fishing research often focuses on ecological (gear, stock-assessment, traceability) or economic factors or indicators. Truly understanding the social-ecological system requires considering the social, cultural, historical, and legal/policy aspects as well. Although regulatory bodies now include human dimensions in their management plans, there are still challenges to integrating social science into the decision-making process. There is a national and international understanding that if resource managers are to understand and develop strategies for coastal resilience, a holistic approach is needed that includes an understanding of the intersection between the dynamics of fisheries management and women's participation within fishing. The objective of this study was to collect oral history data related to past and current strategies for addressing fishing family and community resilience over time. Literature has documented ways in which limited access and catch share programs affect fishing community resilience and sustainability, but have few data that look at how these management systems may be affecting women's roles and participation within the industry. The results from this research adds to the literature on women's roles in the US and provide needed attention to their contribution to the wellbeing, resilience, and adaptive capacity of Oregon's evolving commercial fishing industry.

abstract={The concept of ecosystem goods and services and the approach of a linked social-ecological system were used to identify and describe the interactions between humans and seagrasses in a rural tropical economy in the East Coast of Zanzibar (Chwaka village). The main stakeholders in the population are fishermen and seaweed farmers. Through in-depth and semi-structured interviews, questionnaires, market data analysis and participant observation, we found a diversity of social-ecological links that are important for the welfare of the local population. Fishing grounds for finfish and invertebrates, substrate for seaweed cultivation and sites for bait collection were among the most important ecological support areas for fishermen and farmers. Seagrass-associated fisheries in the form of trap fisheries ({''}dema{''}) provided the highest daily average income per fisherman. Furthermore, seagrass-associated fish constituted the primary source of animal protein for the local people. Seagrasses were also used as traditional medicine and fertilizers. They provided a wide range of ecological services including aesthetical, instrumental, spiritual and religious. The amount of local ecological knowledge (LEK) among fishermen was substantial. No institution directly dealing with seagrasses in the area was identified. The use of a seascape management approach is recommended to improve and develop social-ecological resilience.

abstract={Privatization is, since Hardin, often promoted as a solution to many natural resource management challenges, particularly in common-pool resource systems. However, novel forms of privatization are being implemented in unexamined ways. In this article we explore how privatization affects natural resource management from the perspective of multi-dimensional social-ecological systems. We critique the notion that privatization is desirable due to its pure efficiency, and argue that efficiency must be relative to achieving other normative societal goals, in particular, sustainability. While sustainability outcomes often cannot be fully actualized, the processes through which privatization attempts to achieve them are more tangible criteria. First, we draw on (1) distributional and (2) procedural justice as normative societal goals to assess effectiveness of different forms of privatization. Second, we analyze the broader implications of privatization for social-ecological system functioning considering (3) path dependency and (4) spillover effects. We apply these four concepts to examine three different cases of privatization: eco-certification in fisheries, seed patents in agriculture and property rights in rangelands. We argue that the evaluative criteria for the success of privatization are often oversimplified, and highlight how privatization can influence social-ecological systems and the achievement of normative goals in largely unexamined ways.},

abstract={1. A key challenge facing ecologists and ecosystem managers is understanding what drives unexpected shifts in ecosystems and limits the effectiveness of human interventions. Research that integrates and analyses data from natural and social systems can provide important insight for unravelling the complexity of these dynamics. It is, therefore, a critical step towards the development of evidence-based, whole-system management approaches. 2. To examine our ability to influence ecosystems that are behaving in unexpected ways, we explore three prominent cases of ``ecological surprise.{''} We captured the social-ecological systems (SES) using key variables and interactions from Ostrom's SES framework, which integrates broader ecosystem processes (e.g. climate, connectivity), management variables (e.g. quotas, restrictions, monitoring), resource use behaviours (e.g. harvesting) and the resource unit (e.g. trees, fish, clean water) being managed. 3. Structural equation modelling revealed that management interventions often influenced resource use behaviours (e.g. rules and limits strongly affected harvest or pollution), but they did not have a significant effect on the abundance of the managed resource. Instead, most resource variability was related to ecological processes and feedbacks operating at broader spatial or temporal scales than management interventions, which locked the resource system into the degraded state.},

abstract={The Covid-19 pandemic is a global shock that is significantly affecting coastal social-ecological systems (SES) in different parts of the world. Its widespread impacts have unravelled vulnerabilities in many aspects of society, including food systems. Our study investigated the impacts of a lockdown associated with the pandemic in the province of Bulacan, in the region of Central Luzon, Philippines, where aquaculture and capture fisheries are important and interconnected sectors. In particular, we focused on impacts related to production and market. We considered people's coping strategies and the factors that enabled such strategies. Our investigation adopted a case study approach and drew on qualitative data analysed through thematic analysis. The findings revealed differentiated mechanisms through which aquaculture and capture fisheries production were impacted. Both were strongly affected by market disruptions but through slightly different ways. In effect, the lockdown provided the impetus for the uptake and spreading of practices that were previously peripheral, particularly in relation to market exchanges. The study also identified a variety of coping strategies, as well as the importance of social support in the form of food aid, financial assistance, and institutional livelihood assistance. Finally, it discusses the importance of diversity in food sources, the role of local food systems, and governance implications for foregrounding social-ecological resilience in short-term response and long-term recovery.},

abstract={Sustainably managing fisheries for ecological and social objectives in the current era of rapid environmental change requires that managers, scientists, and fishery stakeholders work together to find solutions to complex problems. Recognizing that multiple forms of knowledge generation exist and focusing on the strengths of different ways-of-knowing can facilitate a more holistic understanding of these problems. Here, we illustrate the value in both natural and social science-generated information for informing our understanding of a rapidly changing social-ecological system. Using data collected through an in-person and online survey, we show that methods for quantifying user perceptions can facilitate the integration of social data with traditional scientific data collection efforts. Specifically, the synthesis of a Bayesian lifecycle model (Cunningham et al. 2018) for Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha and quantified fisher perceptions suggests that natural science efforts and resource users largely agree on many of the factors that may be contributing to the observed declines in abundance of Chinook Salmon in Alaska. A qualitative assessment of the perceptions of resource users revealed benefits to incorporating stakeholders in science and management, including the ability to identify regional issues or trends potentially unrealized by natural science approaches. Our study highlights the synergistic value of multiple sources of ecological information for sustainably managing fishery systems.},

abstract={Marine social-ecological systems (SES) have been providing important cultural, social, and economic services for many centuries. They are, however, increasingly threatened by fast changing environmental, ecological, and socio-economic conditions. As historical marine research is increasingly developing into a multidisciplinary endeavour, it offers outstanding points of departure to analyse historic events and the response and adaptation of the respective SES. Such knowledge helps to inform today's fisheries management and promotes successful management of changing ecosystems. Here, we compile and analyse historical data (1890-1950) of the German Western Baltic Sea fishery SES. This period is characterised by a series of strong impacts due to political, technological, economic, and ecological changes, such as two world wars, a global economic crisis, and other economic or ecological disasters. In our opinion, potential negative effects of those events were in the past attenuated by the system's high capacity to adapt. However, most of the fishers ` historic options on how to respond and adapt have recently become no longer available. New threats (e.g. climate change) have emerged instead. We conclude that today's fisheries management needs to integrate options of adaptation by exhausting all present or future opportunities. Adaptive fisheries management should not only focus on environmental change but need to include socio-economic change as well.},

abstract={Community resilience, the capacity of a community to adapt to change in ways that result in positive impacts on its well-being, is increasingly used as a framework for understanding and enhancing the sustainability of forest-dependent communities as social ecological systems. However, studies linking community resilience to the implementation of forest management programs are limited. This study uses community resilience literature and analyzes data collected from interviews to study barriers of forest-dependent communities of collaborative forest management (CFM) in two forest-dependent communities in the Ashanti region of Ghana. Analysis revealed the barriers in community response to CFM programs in these two communities comprise institutional shortfalls in the design and implementation of the CFM program that have constrained the incentives, capacity and opportunities for communities to successfully adapt to the program. The paper offers recommendations on how the CFM program can contribute to building the resilience of communities in managing their forests. The first is to build institutional capacity of communities to play an active role in forest governance, and the second is the prioritization of well-being and livelihood enhancement as forest management goals.

abstract={In order to achieve collaborative action in nature conservation and natural resources management, stakeholders have to understand and acknowledge other stakeholders' interests, values, world visions and objectives and they have to overcome the problem of irrational decision-making through innate opposition discourses. In this paper we developed the Mangal Play, an experiential learning method to have participants adopt the role of a particular stakeholder in an imaginary mangrove forest social-ecological system (SES). The Mangal Play is a serious game, more specifically a role-play, aimed at promoting oral dialogues between 20 stakeholders involved in governance, fisheries, aquaculture, agriculture, forestry, tourism, transport, conservation and communication sectors. By providing tools to lecturers and scientists to execute it in a public or classroom setting, the Mangal Play stimulates a decision-making process while accepting compromise and distinguishing bottom-line issues from negotiable positions, and instructs about the behaviour of complex real-world systems in a safe learning environment. We exemplify how social network analysis can serve to visualise the outcome and further develop the Mangal Play. In this way we hope to help stakeholders take into account diverse positions in a rational decision-making process.},

title={Sustained by Snakes? Seasonal Livelihood Strategies and Resource Conservation by Tonle Sap Fishers in Cambodia},
journal={HUMAN ECOLOGY},

volume={36},
number={6},
pages={835-851},
month={DEC},
abstract={This paper situates concerns for conservation of aquatic snakes and livelihood sustainability in Cambodia within a social-ecological systems context and thereby presents a challenge to conventional species-based conservation programmes. Fishing for low-value water snakes has become a widespread activity within the floating communities of Tonle Sap Lake in the last 20 years in response to new market opportunities, provided primarily by a crocodile farming industry. The scale and intensity of this new form of exploitation and reports of declines in catch per fisher have highlighted this activity as a conservation concern, yet its role within local livelihood strategies was previously unknown. We show that it is of increasing importance to the less well-off, and is linked to higher incomes within this group, where it potentially reduces their vulnerability to fluctuations and declines in fish catches. It is particularly important as a means to smooth seasonality of incomes in this flood pulse-driven social-ecological system. We argue that shifts between snake-hunting and fishing, as a market-driven adaptive livelihood strategy by the poor, may be more compatible with wider ecosystem conservation and development goals than alternatives such as increased fishing effort or converting floodplain habitats for seasonal agriculture.},

title={Poverty and the use of destructive fishing gear near east African marine protected areas},
journal={ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION},
year={2009},
volume={36},
number={4},
pages={321-326},
month={NA},
abstract={Poverty may be an important influence on the exploitation of marine resources in tropical developing countries. A number of studies have hypothesized that destructive fishing gears, which can degrade habitat, capture high proportions of juvenile fish and ultimately lead to reduced yields, are primarily used by the poorer segments of society. However, few studies have empirically tested this relationship. This paper examines relationships between the use of destructive seine nets and thirteen socioeconomic conditions in communities adjacent to three peri-urban marine protected areas in east Africa. Fishers using destructive gears were younger, less likely to have capital invested in the fishery, had lower fortnightly expenditures and were poorer in two multivariate indices of material style of life. Based on the two multivariate material style of life indices, a binary logistic regression model classified whether fishers used destructive gears with almost 70\% accuracy. These findings are broadly consistent with the literature on poverty traps, which are situations in which the poor are unable to mobilize the resources required to overcome low-income situations and consequently engage in behaviour that may reinforce their own poverty. Managers aiming to reduce destructive gear use may need to partner with civil society and donors to help break poverty traps.},

journal={SUSTAINABILITY},
year={2023},
volume={15},
number={22},
pages={NA},
month={NOV},
abstract={Worldwide, fisheries have experienced change over time. An excess of exploitation for providing food has led to overfishing and the depletion of fish stocks. However, fishing communities are also part of the cultural heritage and contribute to the attractiveness of coastal areas to tourists. Our aim is to identify if ecosystem service assessments (ESA) can reflect the condition of fisheries and their economic and social aspects. We developed a tailored, expert-based ESA and applied it to two case studies in the eastern German Baltic Sea under different fishery management scenarios. The results show that reducing fishing pressure, actively restoring habitats, and improving their ecological status increase the provision of most ecosystem services. We discuss and conclude that ESAs allow for a holistic view on fisheries that goes beyond the economic importance of fisheries and shows both the interdependence between fisheries and healthy marine ecosystems, and their relevance for coastal communities. Such a holistic view is necessary for a sustainable approach to fisheries management. Our approach is easily transferable to other regions, and can be used to structure discussion on fisheries management scenarios, as well as to track and visualize societal changes.},

abstract={While international agreements and legislation call for incorporation of four pillars of sustainability, the social (including cultural), economic and institutional aspects (the `human dimension') have been relatively neglected to date. Three key impediments have been identified: a relative lack of explicit social, economic and institutional objectives; a general lack of process (frameworks, governance) for routine integration of all four pillars of sustainability; and a bias towards biological considerations. Practical integration requires a `systems' approach with explicit consideration of strategic and operational aspects of management; multidisciplinary or transdisciplinary evaluations; practical objectives for the four pillars of sustainability; appropriate participation; and a governance system that is able to integrate these diverse considerations in management. We challenge all involved in fisheries to immediately take five practical steps toward integrating ecological, economic, social and institutional aspects: (1) Adopt the perspective of the fishery as a `system' with interacting natural, human and management elements; (2) Be aware of both strategic and operational aspects of fisheries assessment and management; (3) Articulate overarching objectives that incorporate all four pillars of sustainability; (4) Encourage appropriate (and diverse) disciplinary participation in all aspects of research, evaluation and management; and (5) Encourage development of (or emulate) participatory governance.},

abstract={Millions of individuals worldwide rely on recreational fishing activities for leisure, food, and employment. Recreational fishing is the dominant freshwater fisheries sector in much of the highly developed world and plays a growing role in the marine realm, but in developing countries recreational fisheries occur within a different set of contextual conditions. Little is currently known about attributes of the recreational fishing sector in many developing countries. A survey of fisheries experts designed to identify knowledge gaps surrounding recreational fishery development was conducted to gather information on fishery attributes in developing countries. These surveys were supplemented with a review of relevant literature. Results show that recreational fishing is socially important and is expected to grow in most countries surveyed. Recreational fisheries were described as mainly consumption oriented in these regions. Most often, nonresident tourists used marine waters and resident recreational fishers used fresh waters. There was strong agreement among respondents on the need to address data deficiencies. The knowledge gaps and management needs identified can support international bodies and recreational fishing organizations (such as the regional fisheries bodies of the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations, and local and international fishing associations) to support sustainable development and management of the global recreational fisheries sector.},

abstract={Efforts to confront the challenges of environmental change and uncertainty include attempts to adaptively manage social-ecological systems. However, critical questions remain about whether adaptive management can lead to sustainable outcomes for both ecosystems and society. Here, we make a contribution to these efforts by presenting a 16-y analysis of ecological outcomes and perceived livelihood impacts from adaptive coral reef management in Papua New Guinea. The adaptive management system we studied was a customary rotational fisheries closure system (akin to fallow agriculture), which helped to increase the biomass of reef fish and make fish less wary (more catchable) relative to openly fished areas. However, over time the amount of fish in openly fished reefs slowly declined. We found that, overall, resource users tended to have positive perceptions about this system, but there were negative perceptions when fishing was being prohibited. We also highlight some of the key traits of this adaptive management system, including 1) strong social cohesion, whereby leaders played a critical role in knowledge exchange; 2) high levels of compliance, which was facilitated via a ``carrot-and-stick{''} approach that publicly rewarded good behavior and punished deviant behavior; and 3) high levels of participation by community actors.},

abstract={Understanding fisher beliefs and attitudes towards specific management strategies can help inform and improve fisheries management, and thus stock sustainability. Previous studies highlight a lack of fisher awareness regarding environmental issues influencing the systems they utilise and the negative impacts of specific strategies, such as stock enhancement. Our study used a two-phase approach to first elicit and then measure the strength of common fishers' beliefs and associated attitudes regarding stock enhancement. Specifically, this research focused on recreational fishers of an estuarine crab fishery (Portunus armatus) in south-western Australia. The results demonstrate that recreational fishers believe stock enhancement could have strong positive outcomes, but also recognise that this management strategy could lead to some negative outcomes, though the latter are perceived as less likely to happen. This contrasts with previous research on fisheries stocking and demonstrates the value of using the two-phase approach to clarify fishers' perceptions of particular management approaches. To reduce fisher dissatisfaction with management actions, careful communication on the benefits and costs of stock enhancement is recommended. Our study highlights the significance of integrating social sciences into fisheries research, and the need to better understand fishing community beliefs to ensure effective management of the fishery.},

abstract={Adaptation of environmental policies to often unexpected crises is an important function of sustainable governance arrangements. However the relationship between environmental change and policy is complicated. Much research has focused on understanding institutional dynamics or the role of specific participants in the policy process. This paper draws attention to interest groups and the mechanism through which they influence policy change. Existing research offers conflicting evidence in regards to the different ways in which interest groups may affect change. This paper provides an in-depth study of the 2013 European Union Common Fisheries Policy reform a policy change characterized by active interest group participation. It traces the activity of interest group coalitions to understand how they achieved influence under a changing policy context. The study involves interviews with interest group representatives, policy experts and decision-makers, document analysis of interest group statements and EU legislative documents. Findings identify the important role of coalition building and informational lobbying for environmental interest group success in exploiting favorable sociopolitical conditions and influencing reform outcomes. An insight on interest group influence and its conditions contributes to our understanding of the complex dynamics of the environmental policy process as well as its implications for policy adaptation to environmental change.},

title={From shared socio-economic pathways (SSPs) to oceanic system pathways (OSPs): Building policy-relevant scenarios for global oceanic ecosystems and fisheries},

number={NA},

month={JUL},
abstract={There is an urgent need for developing policy-relevant future scenarios of biodiversity and ecosystem services. This paper is a milestone toward this aim focusing on open ocean fisheries. We develop five contrasting Oceanic System Pathways (OSPs), based on the existing five archetypal worlds of Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) developed for climate change research (e.g., Nakicenovic et al., 2014 and Riahi et al., 2016). First, we specify the boundaries of the oceanic social-ecological system under focus. Second, the two major driving forces of oceanic social-ecological systems are identified in each of three domains, viz., economy, management and governance. For each OSP (OSP1 ``sustainability first{''}, OSP2 ``conventional trends{''}, OSP3 ``dislocation{''}, OSP4 ``global elite and inequality{''}, OSP5 ``high tech and market{''}), a storyline is outlined describing the evolution of the driving forces with the corresponding SSP. Finally, we compare the different pathways of oceanic social-ecological systems by projecting them in the two-dimensional spaces defined by the driving forces, in each of the economy, management and governance domains. We expect that the OSPs will serve as a common basis for future model based scenario studies in the context of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES).},

abstract={We investigated the capacity of a natural resource governance system to absorb a disturbance while maintaining its major structures and functions (defined as institutional resilience). Exemplified by East German recreational fisheries governance being disturbed by the German reunification, we studied why in five out of six East German states the former centralized governance system persisted while in one state a decentralized governance system was implemented. Based on resilience thinking and new institutional economics, three analytical steps were developed to assess: (1) the structure and function of the governance system, (2) the attributes of the disturbance and the reorganization process, and (3) human motivations. The centralized system persisted because leading managers wanted to preserve customary structures and functions, minimize transaction costs of change, and maintain powerful positions. This was possible because of their influential positions in the reorganization process. Our results suggest that in externally induced, fundamental, and rapid disturbances decision-makers tend to prevent transformations in their governance system. However, key managers in the sixth state faced the same disturbance but their lack of leadership and an emerging rivalry for fishing rights facilitated a transformation to decentralized governance. Thus, attributes of disturbances can be leveraged by actors' motivations in the reorganization process. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The well-being of coastal communities is intimately tied to a healthy ocean, but coastal social-ecological systems are among the most vulnerable to global change. Improving the resilience of coastal communities requires an understanding of how local social-ecological systems respond to shocks to better inform decision-making and adapt local management interventions. However, assessments of social-ecological changes throughout a disturbance regime are scarce at the local level, although critical for efficient natural resource management and sustainable use of ocean ecosystem services. Here, we apply the Ocean Health Index (OHI) to assess the status of the marine social-ecological system of a tropical island (Moorea, French Polynesia), and track changes of the system before, during and after a disturbance regime. Our results show that while there are signs of social-ecological recovery, coastal protection was most affected along the disturbance, and that there is room for improvement toward biodiversity conservation. In addition, our study highlights some context-specific challenges associated with local OHI assessments, particularly those driven by limited fisheries data and appropriate reference point selection for coastal protection. Our results demonstrate the value of localized, regular OHI assessments through time to track changes in marine social-ecological systems, while uncovering important data gaps, to inform management at appropriate scales for decision-making.},

abstract={Fisheries sustainability is recognized to have four pillars: ecological, economic, social (including cultural) and institutional (or governance). Although international agreements, and legislation in many jurisdictions, call for implementation of all four pillars of sustainability, the social, economic and institutional aspects (i.e., the human dimensions) have not been comprehensively and collectively addressed to date. This study describes a framework for comprehensive fisheries evaluation developed by the Canadian Fisheries Research Network (CFRN) that articulates the full spectrum of ecological, economic, social and institutional objectives required under international agreements, together with candidate performance indicators for sustainable fisheries. The CFRN framework is aimed at practical fisheries evaluation and management and has a relatively balanced distribution of elements across the four pillars of sustainability relative to 10 alternative management decision support tools and indicator scorecards, which are heavily focused on ecological and economic aspects. The CFRN framework has five immediate uses: (a) It can serve as a logic frame for defining management objectives; (b) it can be used to define alternate management options to achieve given objectives; (c) it can serve as a tool for comparing management scenarios/options in decision support frameworks; (d) it can be employed to create a report card for comprehensive fisheries management evaluation; and (e) it is a tool for practical implementation of an integrated social-ecological system approach.},

abstract={Understanding how humans and other animals behave in response to changes in their environments is vital for predicting population dynamics and the trajectory of coupled social-ecological systems. Here, we present a novel framework for identifying emergent social behaviours in foragers (including humans engaged in fishing or hunting) in predator-prey contexts based on the exploration difficulty and exploitation potential of a renewable natural resource. A qualitative framework is introduced that predicts when foragers should behave territorially, search collectively, act independently or switch among these states. To validate it, we derived quantitative predictions from two models of different structure: a generic mathematical model, and a lattice-based evolutionary model emphasising exploitation and exclusion costs. These models independently identified that the exploration difficulty and exploitation potential of the natural resource controls the social behaviour of resource exploiters. Our theoretical predictions were finally compared to a diverse set of empirical cases focusing on fisheries and aquatic organisms across a range of taxa, substantiating the framework's predictions. Understanding social behaviour for given social-ecological characteristics has important implications, particularly for the design of governance structures and regulations to move exploited systems, such as fisheries, towards sustainability. Our framework provides concrete steps in this direction.},

abstract={This paper combines primary and secondary data to highlight the history of resource use and ongoing change in a coastal social-ecological system (SES) in Japan. We focus on Himeshima island, whose local community both depends on coastal ecosystem services and has developed over generations resource management practices informed by a rich body of traditional and local knowledge (TLK). By engaging with local resource users through focus group discussions (FGDs), household surveys and expert interviews we identify 14 ecosystem services that contribute manifold to the wellbeing of the local community. While provisioning services are key for the livelihoods of most community members, some of the cultural services related to the traditional food culture and food-sharing practices are a source of pride and cohesion for the local community. However, respondents indicated that several key provisioning and cultural ecosystem services have degraded over time through the combined effects of habitat change/loss and overexploitation. Underlying drivers include demographic, economic and technological change that has eroded TLK practices associated with fisheries management.

abstract={As the largest archipelagic country, Indonesia has been unable to prioritize the ocean to improve its economy. Despite implementing various fisheries management approaches, Indonesia has consistently failed to establish the right policies. The Indonesian government's current breakthrough was to combine the ecosystem approach to fisheries management (EAFM) and quota-based fisheries management (QBFM). Policies that combine these two concepts are known as `perikanan terukur' (measurable fisheries). The observation views the perspective of local stakeholders on this measurable fisheries policy. Fisheries management area (FMA) 718 was conducted as research areas while designed as industrial fisheries and national fish supply areas. FMA 718 is also represented by Merauke Regency (South Papua) and Aru Islands Regency (Maluku). The perception of 67 key respondents was modeled using qualitative network modeling. The results showed at least 28 initial variables related to the response to QBFM. The developed model indicated that local stakeholders had rejected this policy. The implications that emerged to implement this policy were to ensure the distribution of authority between layers of government. The gap between local and commercial fishermen must be resolved immediately. There is a need for community involvement in policy, including efforts to develop policies based on data and factual conditions.},

journal={SUSTAINABILITY},
year={2021},
volume={13},
number={11},
pages={NA},
month={JUN},
abstract={In southern Benin, the rapid growth of demographics and the need for fishery products have forced public managers to adopt various management measures in the face of anti-ecological methods used by fishers; however, these strategies are often formulated independent from the context. These measures have not remained without consequence on the daily lives of fishers. This paper examines factors influencing fishers' individual perceived wellbeing satisfaction using the social-ecological system framework. Data on 205 small-scale fishers' demographic information, perception of job, and individual wellbeing satisfaction and governance subsystems were collected and analysed by the use of an ordered logistic regression. The results demonstrate that job satisfaction and ownership of water bodies (in contradiction to Ostrom's advocation for commons management) affected fishers' individual perceived wellbeing satisfaction. Fishers likely value ownerships, affecting their perceived wellbeing mainly in the South East. The prohibition of certain fishing gear decreases fishers' individual perceived wellbeing, indicating their attachment to these. Therefore, the question remains as to whether or not the scenarios of eco-sustainability of artisanal fisheries can be managed in the same manner as those related urban dwellers and the public sector. This is in particular reference to the line between urban land property rights, urban dwellers and the state, and property rights on water bodies, fishers, and the state.},

month={MAR},
abstract={The theory of adaptive cycles, as developed almost 40 years ago by Holling (1986), has great potential as a tool to understand, anticipate, and alter the trajectories of change in natural resource systems. However, its incorporation in natural resource policy and management remains limited. A total of 112 studies are reviewed to assess how the theory of adaptive cycles has been applied to understand the behavior of natural resource systems (i.e., woodlands, croplands, rangelands, and fisheries) and how its application can be improved to enhance the potential of the theory to inform natural resource management. The review reveals that the theory has largely been applied in haphazard ways because there is no procedure in place to prevent the manipulation of empirical data to fit the path prescribed by the theory. The theory of adaptive cycles is primarily approached as a conceptual framework instead of as a set of testable and falsifiable hypotheses. Ill-fitting management recommendations can ensue when the theory is not tested, which demonstrates the pressing need for the development of a standardized procedure that future studies can follow. A 7-step procedure is developed to enhance the transparency and reliability of the application of the theory of adaptive cycles and to contribute to the realization of its potential to inform natural resource management.},

abstract={Seagrass ecosystems have been identified as important marine ecosystem service (ES) providers, they contribute to coastal protection, fisheries provision and mitigate climate change among others. Yet, they are declining globally at alarming rates. While the ecological dimensions of this social-ecological system have been well studied, its associated social aspects remain largely unexplored. Here, we show how the analysis of stakeholders' perceptions on seagrass ES, their drivers of change, links to wellbeing and governance structures can provide a path towards a more sustainable management. Stakeholders identified seagrass regulatory ES as crucial for the maintenance of social and economic wellbeing and the potential causes and consequences associated to seagrass dedine. Power imbalances, an over-compartmentalized legislation and a generalized lack of awareness were highlighted as key aspects to redress in order to achieve a more just governance system. Stakeholders' empirical evidence on the importance of particular ES and on negative drivers of change can also provide an understanding of areas where financial investment would gather wider public support and therefore be more successfully implemented. We showed how the different dimensions highlighted through stakeholders' perspectives can contribute to the consecution of a more inclusive sustainable management, a crucial aspect in the maintenance of seagrass ecosystems.

abstract={New methods have emerged for testing common-pool resource theory in large-scale environmental governance contexts. We aim to contribute to that scholarship by assessing the relevance of Elinor Ostrom's design principles in the lower Mekong basin (LMB). The recent dam-building trend in the LMB has revealed a trade-off between hydropower development and the conservation of migratory fish species. The need to internalize or avoid the negative externalities of hydropower dam construction poses a new challenge to the LMB governance system and its main management body, the Mekong River Commission. Our objective was to explain the emergence of the trade-off and the capacity of the governance system to address it. Elinor Ostrom's design principles and other variables provided by the Socio-ecological Systems Meta-analysis Database were first coded with regard to secondary data and then tested against the capacity for cooperation of the LMB governance system. The lack of sanctioning despite a strong monitoring system, and the existence of fuzzy governance boundaries in the context of a powerful outsider like China, were particularly relevant to understanding the current cooperation stalemate in the basin. Other variables such as scientific knowledge, triggering events, markets, resource spatial heterogeneity, and heterogeneity of interests were also relevant.},

abstract={There is now a large literature on ecosystem-based management (EBM; also known as the ecosystem approach). Our sense is that EBM is moving - albeit slowly - from the ``what's, why's and when's{''} to the ``how's{''} of operationalization and implementation; as such it seemed timely to develop this article theme set (TS). Our objectives were to ascertain the state of the discipline and to advance EBM by offering practical examples of its implementation -or attempts at such -in a variety of incarnations and at various scales, including what has or has not worked, suggestions for best practice, and lessons learned. As exemplified by the articles in this TS, key lessons learned include the need for: constant and clear communication with all parties involved; clear objectives and governance; the distillation of complex ecosystem information into digestible indicators; the establishment of reference levels on which management decisions can be made; and clear protocols to evaluate tradeoffs. Instances of truly multisectoral EBM remain rare, with EBM having advanced farthest within specific ocean-use sectors. Although progress towards implementing operational EBM has been somewhat limited, and although EBM is by its very nature complex and difficult to operationalize, there has been progress nonetheless. We hope that this TS will encourage even further operationalization of EBM.},

abstract={The Kenai River Fishery is a unique social-ecological system (SES) with nearly 50 federal, state, local, and nonprofit groups influencing its political, ecological, and social structure. While ecological data exists for this fishery, the complexity of its stakeholder relationships has not been investigated. Stakeholder interactions can directly influence how science is integrated into management decisions and therefore affect the adaptive capacity of SES, such as the Kenai River Fishery. Drawing from the existing stakeholder literature, this methods identifies and ranks the key SES stakeholders and describes their roles. This study approached the question of which stakeholders should be included in a future SES adaptive capacity study by (1) identifying the key stakeholders within the Kenai River Fishery, (2) ranking each stakeholder's investment within the fishery using eleven categories of interaction, and (3) using these eleven categories to characterize each stakeholder's role within the SES. The largest number of stakeholders fall into the secondary investment category, showing that a relatively small number of resource managers are interacting with a large number of diverse nonprofit organizations. The top ranking stakeholders in this study will be invited to attend participatory scenarios workshops that will build the foundation for a deeper scenarios-based analysis of SES adaptive capacity.

abstract={Report cards are increasingly used to provide ongoing snap-shots of progress towards specific ecosystem health goals, particularly in coastal regions where planners need to balance competing demands for coastal resources from a range of industries. While most previous report cards focus on the biophysical components of the system, there is a growing interest in including the social and economic implications of ecosystem management to provide a greater social-ecological system understanding. Such a report card was requested on the Gladstone Harbour area in central Queensland, Australia. Gladstone Harbour adjoins the southern Great Barrier Reef, and is also a major industrial and shipping port. Balancing social, economic and environmental interests is therefore of great concern to the regional managers. While environmental benchmarking procedures are well established within Australia (and elsewhere), a method for assessing social and economic performance of coastal management is generally lacking. The key aim of this study was to develop and pilot a system for the development of a report card relating to appropriate cultural, social and economic objectives. The approach developed uses a range of multicriteria decision analysis methods to assess and combine different qualitative and quantitative measures, including the use of Bayesian Belief Networks to combine the different measures and provide an overall quantitative score for each of the key management objectives. The approach developed is readily transferable for purposes of similar assessments in other regions.},

abstract={Coastal communities are being impacted by climate change, affecting the livelihoods, food security, and wellbeing of residents. Human wellbeing is influenced by the heath of the environment through numerous pathways and is increasingly being included as a desired outcome in environmental management. However, the contributors to wellbeing can be subjective and the values and perspectives of decision-makers can affect the aspects of wellbeing that are included in planning. We used Q methodology to examine how a group of individuals in fisheries management prioritize components of wellbeing that may be important to coastal communities in the California Current social-ecological system (SES). The California Current SES is an integrated system of ecological and human communities with complex linkages and connections where commercial fishing is part of the culture and an important livelihood. We asked individuals that sit on advisory bodies to the Pacific Fisheries Management Council to rank 36 statements about coastal community wellbeing, ultimately revealing three discourses about how we can best support or improve wellbeing in those communities. We examine how the priorities differ between the discourses, identify areas of consensus, and discuss how these perspectives may influence decision-making when it comes to tradeoffs inherent in climate adaptation in fisheries. Lastly, we consider if and how thoughts about priorities have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.},

abstract={Coral reef fisheries are crucial to the livelihoods of tens of millions of people; yet, widespread habitat degradation and unsustainable fishing are causing severe depletion of stocks of reef fish. Understanding how social and economic factors, such as human population density, access to external markets, and modernization interact with fishing and habitat degradation to affect fish stocks is vital to sustainable management of coral reef fisheries. We used fish survey data, national social and economic data, and path analyses to assess whether these factors explain variation in biomass of coral reef fishes among 25 sites in Solomon Islands. We categorized fishes into 3 groups on the basis of life-history characteristics associated with vulnerability to extinction by fishing (high, medium, and low vulnerability). The biomass of fish with low vulnerability was positively related to habitat condition. The biomass of fishes with high vulnerability was negatively related to fishing conducted with efficient gear. Use of efficient gear, in turn, was strongly and positively related to both population density and market proximity. This result suggests local population pressure and external markets have additive negative effects on vulnerable reef fish. Biomass of the fish of medium vulnerability was not explained by fishing intensity or habitat condition, which suggests these species may be relatively resilient to both habitat degradation and fishing.},

title={An ecosystem services perspective for the economic value of seafood production supported by seagrass ecosystems: An exercise in Derawan Island, Indonesia},
journal={NA},
year={2020},
volume={414},
number={NA},
pages={NA},
month={NA},
abstract={Seagrass meadows provide provisioning services that play a vital role in food security and human wellbeing, especially on the small island. However, the utilisation value is uncalculated as support for seafood production and livelihoods for the community, because they are considered as alternative uses, so that seagrass ecosystem services are underestimated and undervalued. This paper aims to show the economic value provided by seagrass ecosystem services in providing seafood, both as a primary or secondary source. Through field survey and effect on production (EOP) analysis shows that capture fisheries and other marine biota collecting, both crustacean and mollusc species associated with the seagrass ecosystem are utilised directly by coastal communities in Derawan Island, Indonesia. Estimates of the economic value of fish and marine biota employed in the seagrass ecosystem area are US\$ US\$ 13,488.80 and US\$ 35,744.69 per hectare per year, respectively, or a total of US\$ 49,233.49 per hectare per year. This value demonstrates the potential importance of seagrass ecosystems. Unfortunately, these benefit values have not been fully understood by the communities, so that many people ignore the function of seagrass ecosystem services as provisioning services, although in the scarcity the utilisation of the seagrass ecosystem is quite intensive. Hence, the precautionary principle and suggesting conservation actions in a participatory manner is challenging to implement.},

abstract={Marine renewable energy (MRE), though a relative newcomer to the ocean and coastal commons, has become a significant driver of marine spatial planning in the US, posing particular challenges to commercial fisheries and fishing communities. State and federal agencies with primary oversight for MRE development have focused on the identification of places where MRE might proceed unhindered by other uses, most notably coastal fisheries. These agencies and MRE developers have focused on potential space-use conflict and standard mitigation measures for loss of access to that space. However, discussions with fishery participants and other community members, as well as observations of processes on the US West and East Coasts, reveal a complex, multi-faceted social-ecological system not easily parsed out among users, nor amenable to classic mitigation formulas. Recent ethnographic research on potential space-use conflicts and mitigation for MRE demonstrates that marine space use is dynamic and multi-dimensional, with important linkages among fisheries, communities and other interests. Although experiences vary within and across regions and fishing communities, this research illustrates the weak position of fishing communities in marine spatial planning in the context of MRE development. This paper considers the implications of MRE for US East and West Coast fisheries and fishing communities situated within the larger context of neoliberalism and commodification of the ocean commons.

abstract={Small-scale fisheries in coral reef areas support the livelihoods of millions of people worldwide. Anthropogenic impacts such as overfishing and climate change increasingly threaten both the reef ecosystem and the livelihood security of the people that depend on the reefs. Adaptive management strategies are needed to adequately deal with these threats, but they require an understanding of the underlying drivers, which often originate and act on multiple levels. Using a social-ecological system approach, the coral reef fishery of the Spermonde Archipelago in South Sulawesi/Indonesia is assessed to identify key drivers and strategic leverage points for management. Under the influence of international markets and technological changes, several export-oriented fisheries have developed in the area that led to distinct subsequent peaks in fishing activity in a pattern of sequential marine resource exploitation. In response to stressors such as seasonality and overfishing of individual locations or species, a number of coping strategies have developed locally. These include extensive borrowing from fishing patrons, diversification of fishing methods, fishing migrations, and the crafting of local institutions to regulate fishing activity. However, the coping strategies hinder, and even decrease, the capacity of the system to adapt to future stressors and undermine the sustainability of the fishery. Potential strategies that target different levels of the fishery system in order to strengthen adaptive management are identified.},

abstract={This research examines perceptions of the linkages between ecosystem services (ES) and social wellbeing in a smallscale fishing community in Bluefields, Jamaica. It analyzes the perceived changes to these linkages based on the impacts of a marine protected area (MPA) on this coastal social-ecological system. MPAs can have positive long-term social and ecological effects, but in the short-term they can negatively impact communities, and careful attention to these impacts is needed to achieve positive conservation outcomes. We conducted 42 semi-structured interviews and six focus groups discussions with community members in Bluefields. Key findings from this research include: 1) the importance of provisioning (e.g., fish, lobster) and cultural ES (e.g., cultural heritage, bequest values) and their bundled qualities to both fishers and non-fishers; 2) the perceived impact of the MPA is highest for inshore fishers, while offshore fishers/non-fishers reported few/no negative impacts; and 3) inshore fishers perceive being more marginalized in governance processes, despite reporting the greatest negative change to ES access and social wellbeing from MPA implementation. The results suggest that governance processes for coastal conservation must acknowledge the individual and shared values of coastal areas and traditional livelihoods to achieve long-term legitimacy and support.},

abstract={Climate shocks can reorganize the social-ecological linkages in food-producing communities, leading to a sudden loss of key products in food systems. The extent and persistence of this reorganization are difficult to observe and summarize, but are critical aspects of predicting and rapidly assessing community vulnerability to extreme events. We apply network analysis to evaluate the impact of a climate shock-an unprecedented marine heatwave-on patterns of resource use in California fishing communities, which were severely affected through closures of the Dungeness crab fishery. The climate shock significantly modified flows of users between fishery resources during the closures. These modifications were predicted by pre-shock patterns of resource use and were associated with three strategies used by fishing community member vessels to respond to the closures: temporary exit from the food system, spillover of effort from the Dungeness crab fishery into other fisheries, and spatial shifts in where crab were landed. Regional differences in resource use patterns and vessel-level responses highlighted the Dungeness crab fishery as a seasonal ``gilded trap{'' for northern California fishing communities. We also detected disparities in climate shock response based on vessel size, with larger vessels more likely to display spatial mobility. Our study demonstrates the importance of highly connected and decentralized networks of resource use in reducing the vulnerability of human communities to climate shocks.},

abstract={Through the construction of a socio-ecological timeline for the Porsanger fjord ecosystem, this article illustrates the different ways in which environmental and social-ecological changes have influenced the adaptations of rural households in coastal Sami communities in Finnmark, north Norway. The main finding is that, although environmental change in the form of seal invasions and dwindling fish stocks directly impacted the fisheries, the introduction of a new vessel quota system decisively changed adaptive capacity and coastal Sami household adaptation strategies. These changes represented a tipping point for the social-ecological system in the period between 1986 and 1990. It is thus important to discuss the ways in which governance systems may facilitate actions to adapt to climate and biodiversity change and foster sustainable rural livelihood systems in coastal Norway. Based on traditional and local ecological knowledge on the state of the ecosystem prior to the tipping point, two relevant actions to increase the resilience of the system were identified: ensuring the possibility of re-entry into fisheries as part of rural livelihood combinations, and ecological restoration of kelp beds. Flexible diversification of livelihoods allows exploitation of a range of adjacent species without large investments in a fossile fuel-driven fisheries economy. Investing in regrowth of macroalgae to foster cod nursery areas and increase carbon sequestration can be a relevant alternative for communities that are interested in contributing to climate change mitigation on a larger scale.},

abstract={Are coastal communities relevant in fisheries management? Starting from what Svein Jentoft has had to say about the topic, we explore the idea that viable fishing communities require viable fish stocks, and viable fish stocks require viable fishing communities. To elaborate and expand on Jentoft's arguments, first, we discuss values as a key attribute of communities that confer the ability to manage coastal resources. Turning to power, next we explore why fishing communities need to be empowered by having the opportunity to self-manage or co-manage resources. Third, regarding community viability, we make the argument that (1) rebuilding or maintaining viable fishing communities and fish stocks cannot succeed without first dealing with vulnerabilities, and that (2) the dimensions of vulnerability involve increase/decrease in well-being, better/poorer access to capitals, and building/losing resilience. The idea that healthy fishing communities and healthy fish stocks require one another implies a viable system that contains both, a social-ecological system view. The values embedded in communities enable them to manage resources. Thus, managers and policy makers need to imagine healthy fishing communities who take care of resources, and this positive image of communities is more likely than present policies to lead to viable fishing communities as well as viable fish stocks.},

journal={JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
year={2021},
volume={281},
number={NA},
pages={NA},
month={MAR 1},
abstract={Research on natural resource management like fisheries, irrigation systems or forestry traditionally uses case studies providing us with a rich, in-depth perspective on many single systems. This comes with a disadvantage - lacking comparability as differences between studies exist in variables examined, their operationalization or methods used. Thus, studies often disagree on important drivers for ecological success. However, due to design differences the reasons behind different results often remain unknown. One reason might be the impact of method choice. Hence, this article tests the influence of methods on model results. We use a high-quality data set, the Nepal Irrigation Institutions and Systems database (NIIS), developed at the Ostrom Workshop. It contains 263 cases, each record having information on around 600 variables. Multiple machine learning methods - random forests (RF), gradient boosting (GBM), shallow neural networks (SNN) and deep neural networks (DNN) - are compared with a standard statistical approach (multivariate linear regressions (MLR)). We try to answer the question whether these methods differ in estimating the relevance for success of such well-known concepts like participation of users, resource size, relations with other groups, and social capital among others. The results indicate that both agreements and substantial differences exist across methods which casts doubt on the robustness of previous results. Hence, we advise more caution in interpreting existing results. We see this research as a step towards increasing the robustness of results and improving both generalisability and reproducibility of natural resource management research.},

abstract={Small-scale fisheries (SSF) contribute substantially to global food security, sustainable marine ecosystems and poverty alleviation. Yet many SSF face problems of overexploitation and poverty calling for novel governance approaches that enhance human-wellbeing, equity and ecological sustainability. External policies and interventions to support such governance transformations, however, need to take their often self-governed nature into account. Common practices based on informal arrangements between different fishery actors can make existing, mal-adapted structures very persistent and hence difficult to overcome. Here we combine multi-method empirical research on SSF in Mexico with agent-based modeling to analyze if and under which conditions interventions can shift ongoing self-organizing dynamics into directions that support the new governance form. We are particularly interested in the effectiveness of two different types of interventions, financial and social, and their performance under variable social and ecological conditions as commonly found in SSF. Our analysis reveals that a combination of financial and social support during extended periods of time is necessary to ensure persistence of new governance forms in face of competition with established forms, as well as environmental and social uncertainty. The findings highlight the importance of understanding the endogenous self-organizing dynamics created by the interplay between social (e.g. the dynamics of trust) and ecological (e.g. resource dynamics) processes in order to devise policies and measures to initiate a shift towards more sustainable pathways.},

abstract={Resource users' perceptions are crucial for successful marine governance because they affect community support, participation and legitimacy. Efforts have been made to understand how fishers' attitudes, understandings and interpretations of the environment and its governance emerge in small-scale fisheries. However, many quantitative studies have focused on how individual-level attributes like socio-demographics are associated with perceptions, ignoring a fundamental scale at which humans arrive at their views about the world the - social group. In multi-gear fisheries, fishers typically cluster in two overlapping types of group: occupational groups (defined by fishing gear) and village communities. Taking into account also individual-level variables, which group type is more associated with particular environmental and governance perceptions, e.g. about change in fish stocks, collective action or appropriate management actions? Through questionnaires in combination with multivariate and multi-model inference, this study reveals that, among fishers in two villages in Zanzibar (n = 172), village is more associated with perceptions than occupational group or any other factor. Further, individual attributes like education and age influence perceptions. The main finding implies that the role of social cultural processes might have been underestimated in quantitative research on research users' perceptions. This has consequences for policy and research and shows that both can be informed by statistical analyses that disentangles effects of different levels of group belonging.},

abstract={Global scale drivers such as international markets for shrimp can trigger large changes at local and regional scales. But there is also a poorly appreciated reverse process, operating from the bottom up, with potential for triggering changes at higher scales. Thus, effects of drivers can be seen as a two-way process in which global drivers and local and regional drivers can potentially impact each other. Here, we argue that not only can global drivers impact the sustainability of local and regional social-ecological systems, but sustainability at higher scales can also be impacted by changes at the scale of local and regional social-ecological systems. Using Chilika, a large lagoon on the Bay of Bengal, Odisha State in India as a case, we show that traditional small-scale capture fisheries supporting 150 fisher villages with some 400,000 people were marginalized by aquaculture development for tiger prawn and by state-driven hydrological interventions, with impacts on the ecology of the lagoon. These changes, in turn, contribute to global poverty and food insecurity, making it difficult for India to meet international targets such as millennium development goals. The marginalized fisherfolk become part of environmental justice and other social movements. With large parts of the lagoon converted into a virtual monoculture for the production of tiger prawn, changes in Chilika (a Ramsar site) contribute to wetland habitat loss at the global scale, and biodiversity losses, possibly including IUCN red-listed species.},

journal={ESTUARIES AND COASTS},
year={2017},
volume={40},
number={2},
pages={359-375},
month={MAR},
abstract={Worldwide coral reef conditions continue to decline despite the valuable socioeconomic benefits of these ecosystems. There is growing recognition that quantifying reefs in terms reflecting what stakeholders value is vital for comparing inherent tradeoffs among coastal management decisions. Terrestrial sediment runoff ranks high as a stressor to coral reefs and is a key concern in Puerto Rico where reefs are among the most threatened in the Caribbean. This research aimed to identify the degree to which sediment runoff impacts production of coral reef ecosystem services and the potential for watershed management actions to improve these services. Ecosystem service production functions were applied to map and translate metrics of ecological reef condition into ecosystem service production under a gradient of increasing sediment delivery. We found that higher sediment delivery decreased provisioning of most ecosystem services, including ecosystem integrity, bioprospecting discovery, and reef-based recreational opportunities and fisheries production. However, shoreline protection and services with a strong contribution from non-reef habitats (e.g., mangroves, seagrasses) were higher in locations with high sediment delivery, although there was a strong inshore effect suggesting the influence of distance to shore, depth, and inshore habitats. Differences among services may indicate potential tradeoffs and the need to consider habitat connectivity, nursery habitat, accessibility, and sediment buffering. The relationships we have identified can be used to link stakeholder values to decision alternatives to ensure continued provisioning of these services and the well-being of communities.},

volume={59},

pages={125-130},
month={MAY},
abstract={Off the western coast of Sumatra among the islands of Pulau Banyak, fishing is the primary occupation for the men of Haloban. They are self-described ``traditional{''} fishers, using low-tech gear and small boats to catch fish, octopus, lobster, and other sealife in the nearby coral reefs and mangroves. Women also regularly venture out into the deep mud of the mangroves to collect clams. Their efforts to extract livelihoods and subsistence from the reefs take place in an open-access commons with few formal institutions or enforcement mechanisms to regulate resource use. While explicit regulations and customary limitations on fishing in the coral reef commons are lacking, Haloban fishers improvise some common etiquette and practices that are adaptable to the shifting context. This case study presents Haloban fishers' use of the commons as situated practices, unarticulated and embedded within a complex social ecological system. These practices reflect fishers' understanding of, and relationship with, their environment, and may represent a nascent form of local ``rules-in-use{''}, informing behavior without direct social mechanisms for enforcement. This paper presents research collected using ethnographic methods, including participant observation at sea. As NGOs and government agencies work to craft management plans that share use of the reefs with tourism and conservation, a better understanding of actual resource use and fishing practice may inform more nuanced, adaptable, and truly ``local{''} community-based management.

journal={ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},

volume={19},
number={3},
pages={NA},
month={NA},
abstract={Fisheries-dependent Sami communities in the Norwegian Arctic face major challenges adapting and responding to social-ecological changes. On a local scale, communities and households continually adapt and respond to interacting changes in natural conditions and governance frameworks. Degradation of the marine environment and decline in coastal settlements can move social-ecological systems beyond critical thresholds or tipping points, where the system irreversibly enters a different state. We examined the recent social-ecological history of 2 fjords in Finnmark, North Norway, which have coped, over the past 30 years, with the collapse of local fish stocks, harp seal (Pagophilus groenlandicus) and red king crab (Paralithodes camtschaticus) invasions, and increasingly restrictive resource management regimes. Further, we explored similarities and differences in their social-ecological histories and discuss how the concepts of resilience and tipping points can be applied as analytical tools in empirical studies of community response to social-ecological change. We show that although the ecological changes in the 2 communities have consisted of similar developments, they have been temporally different in ways that may have affected coping strategies and influenced the available options at different times. The apparent resilience of Sami fishing communities can be understood as the result of response strategies employed by communities and households, and the economic opportunities that have opened up as a result of a combination of ecological change and institutional and political reforms.},

volume={30},
number={1},
pages={NA},
month={NA},
abstract={Changes in sea surface temperature have historically impacted the coral reef habitats of giant clams in Kiribati. However, across many islands of Kiribati, the four species of giant clam have largely withstood these environmental changes. We adopted and applied a comprehensive resilience framework to assess attributes conferring and limiting resilience in the Kiribati giant clam data-limited fishery and used knowledge co-production and the precautionary principle approach to better understand resilience. We found that the resilience of the fishery to climate and anthropogenic impacts, as highlighted by local stake- and rightholders, will depend on the ability of fishery actors to act collectively to implement adaptive governance. We used a gradient of human pressure to identify approaches and pathways for improving and operationalising climate resilience. Climate change, coupled with human impacts, have reduced ecological resilience in the urbanised island of South Tarawa. In South Tarawa, governance and social processes are less flexible, leading to declines in the local subsistence clam fishery. Conversely, on several remote outer islands, where the social-ecological system has shown promise in combating these anthropogenic influences, the ecological resilience has improved through adaptive community-based fisheries management, and the subsistence clam fishery has persisted. Our case study demonstrates the importance of a participatory approach and local knowledge when assessing climate resilience and identifies a pathway of resilience in a data-limited small-scale fishery.},

title={Responding to change: Using scenarios to understand how socioeconomic factors may influence amplifying or dampening exploitation feedbacks among Tanzanian fishers},
journal={GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS},
year={2011},
volume={21},
number={1},
pages={7-12},
month={FEB},
abstract={Environmental change often requires societies to adapt. In some instances, these adaptations can create feedbacks that amplify the change. Alternatively, other adaptations may dampen the change. We used semi-structured interviews with 240 fishers from nine Tanzanian coastal communities to explore responses to four hypothetical scenarios of increasingly severe declines in their average catch (10\%, 20\%, 30\% and 50\%). Overall, a higher proportion of fishers said they would respond to decline using amplifying adaptations (such as fishing harder) than dampening adaptations (such as reducing effort), particularly in the scenarios with lower levels of decline. We used a redundancy analysis to explore whether certain types of responses were related to the fishers' socioeconomic characteristics. Fishers that would employ amplifying responses had greater economic wealth but lacked options. Fishers who would adopt dampening responses possessed characteristics associated with having livelihood options. Fishers who would adopt neither amplifying nor dampening responses were less likely to belong to community groups and sold the largest proportion of their catch. This study provides novel contributions by differentiating aspects of adaptive capacity that will amplify versus dampen environmental change and by highlighting what the resource users' themselves say regarding responding to environmental change. Although direct policy application is limited by the study's hypothetical scenario nature, it provides a good beginning to incorporating resource users' voices into such policy discussions.

abstract={Fisheries systems are shaped by dynamic social-ecological interactions that determine their capacity to provide ecosystem services. Human adaptation is often considered a key uncertainty, and there are few quantitative empirical analyses that address long-term social and ecological change in the analyses of fisheries systems. The aim of this study was twofold: (i) to understand how different drivers influenced the adaptations by fishers, and (ii) to evaluate different consequences of such adaptations, especially with regard to diversity of social and ecological links. We used the Baltic Sea as a case study, a system with different fisheries, largely managed with a single-stock advice, in a top-down basis. The study period 1995-2009 was characterized by profound inter-annual fluctuations in fish stock status and prices, and introduction of new types of management measures. We used multivariate statistical methods to define longitudinal changes in fishing tactics and strategies based on logbook data. Our results indicate that changes in fishing strategies have mainly been driven by regulations, and there were only weak linkages between fishing activities, fish stocks, and price fluctuations. We found contrasting trends between large- and small-scale fishers, where large-scale fishers became more specialized and inflexible, whereas small-scale fishers diversified over time. We conclude that management has had a dominating role in shaping fishing patterns, leading to a reduction of important qualities related to the resilience in this social-ecological system.},

abstract={Marine Recreational Fisheries (MRF) provide important socio-economic contributions to coastal communities in the UK. Quantifying the contribution to coastal economies enables policy makers to plan for the sustainable development of these activities and consider trade-offs resulting from the implementation of regulations. Highlighting the importance of MRF enables their integration into fisheries management plans, tourism, and coastal infrastructure strategies, yet these effects are rarely quantified. In this study, the economic contribution of charter boat sea angling on coastal communities was assessed for four ports in Dorset on the South coast of England (Poole, Swanage, Weymouth and Portland). Poole and Weymouth have the largest charter fleets in the UK. Valuations from Poole and Swanage, as well as Weymouth and Portland were used alongside the numbers of boats in the fleet to estimate a cumulative economic impact to Dorset from charter boat activity of 2.4 pound million in gross output and providing about 3.6 pound million in estimated economic contribution and over 1.3 pound million of Gross Value Added (GVA). Future fisheries management should consider impacts and benefits when developing strategies for MRF, potentially distinguishing between different parts of the sector. This is particularly important for the charter fleet, as they are small businesses that rely on the value they generate to operate as businesses rather than being a pure recreational activity.},

title={When push comes to shove in recreational fishing compliance, think `nudge'},
journal={MARINE POLICY},
year={2018},
volume={95},
number={NA},
pages={256-266},
month={SEP},
abstract={Enforcing compliance with rules and regulations in recreational fisheries has proved difficult due to factors such as the high number of participants and costs of enforcement, the absence of regular monitoring of recreational fishing activity, and the inherent difficulties in accurately determining catch levels. The effectiveness of traditional punitive deterrence is limited, yet current management is heavily reliant on this compliance approach. In this paper, the potential of behavioural based management is considered through a narrative review of the relevant literature; specifically, exploring the use of nudges, which aim through subtle changes and indirect suggestion to make certain decisions more salient, thereby improving voluntary compliance. This concept is explored with specific reference to the compliance of fishers within Australian recreational fisheries. There are only a few examples of behavioural based approaches found. However, based on their theoretical foundations, nudges may represent an inexpensive, and potentially highly effective tool for recreational fisheries management. Nudges do not offer a `quick fix' to cases where traditional policy instruments have failed. Rather, there is the potential for behavioural nudges (based on framing, changing the physical environment, presenting default options, and social norms) to augment and complement existing deterrence regimes. A number of potential nudges for compliance management in recreational fisheries are suggested, but caution is advised. As with any novel management approach, nudges must be rigorously tested to demonstrate their cost-effectiveness and to avoid unintended consequences.},

title={Mobility in the mangroves: Catch rates, daily decisions, and dynamics of artisanal fishing in a coastal commons},
journal={APPLIED GEOGRAPHY},
year={2015},
volume={59},
number={SI},
pages={98-106},
month={MAY},
abstract={This paper integrates institutional theories of the commons with insights from geography and human behavioral ecology to explore the spatial and temporal dynamics of artisanal fishing in Ecuador's coastal mangrove swamps. The focus is on the cockle fishery commons characterized by a mixture of formal institutional arrangements and an informal division of fishing space that partially influences fisher decisions about where and when to fish. Individual decisions are further explained to a certain degree by the patch choice model since fishers often move on to new grounds when their catch rates fall below average. These optimizing strategies requiring rotation within a socially produced fishing space may contribute to resource renewal, perceived reliable returns for individuals, and a relative stability in fishing effort, potentially mitigating against resource depletion in open-access areas not managed as a common property regime. This study of the interaction between shellfish harvesters, cultural institutions, and the environment contributes to a spatially explicit theory of the commons and points to the crucial role of resource user mobility and dynamic cultural institutions for the ecological sustainability of shellfish fisheries. A better understanding of feedback between individual decision-making and the self-organization of a social-ecological system has critical implications for policy design and fisheries management at similar scales.

volume={24},
number={3},

month={SEP},
abstract={Freshwater social-ecological systems are shaped by site-specific characteristics, environmental change and annual fluctuations, and the actions of resource users and managers. Our primary aim is to analyze the relative effects of these multifacted forces on fishery productivity and biodiversity using the case of community-managed protected areas within Cambodia's rice field fisheries, known as community fish refuges. Our secondary aim is to take advantage of fixed-effects regression models, a rigorous approach that is common in other disciplines, yet novel to analysis of social-ecological system productivity, and allows comparison of each site to itself across time using observational data. We analyze the relative associations of site characteristics, annual fluctuations, biophysical modifications (e.g., deepening, creation of inlet/outlets, etc.), and governance capacity (i.e., community committee meeting intensity, fundraising to support illegal fishing patrols, etc.) with fish biomass and biodiversity within 40 refuges over three years. We find that seasonal and site-specific effects within this system relate strongly to biomass and species richness patterns. We also find an association between biomass and biodiversity and some elements of governance capacity building. Our findings suggest that in this setting solutions tailored and responsive to the local context may be most appropriate given the strong interannual and site-specific drivers. Methodologically, the dynamism and site specificity of such systems befits within-site comparisons over long time horizons to appreciate the factors that drive biomass and biodiversity.},

journal={MARINE POLICY},
year={2016},
volume={74},
number={NA},
pages={33-42},
month={DEC},
abstract={Identifying socio-economic drivers of small-scale fisheries is a fundamental step to understand impacts and pressures on fishery resources, and the behaviour of seafood trade actors. It is especially relevant for developing countries where such information is usually lacking and fisheries management is greatly needed. To address this gap, this study maps the structure of value chains of fish and marine invertebrates caught by small-scale fisheries from Sao Vicente, Cape Verde (West Africa), and examines the main socio-economic drivers behind the seafood trade on the island. Specifically, it shows how drivers, such as tourism and the local market, shape the preferences for certain species and how they affect the distribution of income among actors involved in the seafood trade. To collect this information, interviews were done with fishers, small-scale traders, market vendors, and restaurant owners, in all fishing communities of the island of Sao Vicente, in 2015. Tourism and the local market drive the exploitation of a wide variety of marine species, from small demersal low trophic level fish and marine invertebrates, to large pelagic high trophic level fish species. Moreover, the local seafood market, and especially tourism dynamics, contribute to the unequal distribution of income among actor groups, benefiting mostly restaurant owners due to their direct access to tourist consumers. Such findings have implications for local fishery resources management, food security, and fishing communities' livelihoods. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

volume={9},

month={AUG 4},
abstract={Despite the importance of livelihood diversification as a transformation strategy in small-scale fisheries facing climate change, empirical evidence on this complex phenomenon is scarce. This work aims to shed light on factors that help to explain the transformative behavior of small-scale fishers when faced with climate change impacts. Using primary survey data from 404 small-scale fishers across 9 communities in Galicia, NW Spain, we examined how different aspects of fishers' adaptive capacities relate to their stated decisions to engage in livelihood diversification when faced with hypothetical climate change scenarios. The results of our multinomial multilevel mixed-effect logit model show that flexibility (current income diversification level and diversity of target fishery resources) has a strong, positive relationship with livelihood diversification responses. In contrast, learning, social organization, and competing concerns played a complex role. Specifically, we found that social-ecological system knowledge, communication with different fishing groups (bridging communication), trust in institutional actors, and gender (female) were positively related to livelihood diversification when faced with climate impacts. Fishing experience, communication within fishing groups (bonding communication), and trust in other fishing groups (bridging trust) were negatively related to diversification.

abstract={As part of an international collaboration to compare large-scale commons, we used the Social-Ecological Systems Meta-Analysis Database (SESMAD) to systematically map out attributes of and changes in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (GBRMP) in Australia. We focus on eight design principles from common-pool resource (CPR) theory and other key social-ecological systems governance variables, and explore to what extent they help explain the social and ecological outcomes of park management through time. Our analysis showed that commercial fisheries management and the re-zoning of the GBRMP in 2004 led to improvements in ecological condition of the reef, particularly fisheries. These boundary and rights changes were supported by effective monitoring, sanctioning and conflict resolution. Moderate biophysical connectivity was also important for improved outcomes. However, our analysis also highlighted that continued challenges to improved ecological health in terms of coral cover and biodiversity can be explained by fuzzy boundaries between land and sea, and the significance of external drivers to even large-scale social-ecological systems (SES). While ecological and institutional fit in the marine SES was high, this was not the case when considering the coastal SES. Nested governance arrangements become even more important at this larger scale. To our knowledge, our paper provides the first analysis linking the re-zoning of the GBRMP to CPR and SES theory. We discuss important challenges to coding large-scale systems for meta-analysis.},

volume={13},

pages={NA},

abstract={Environmental changes caused by climate change in Alaska pose a serious threat to the food, energy and water systems that support the culturally diverse communities statewide. The fishing industry, watershed managers and other stakeholders struggle with understanding and predicting the rates, magnitude and location of changes occurring in their regions primarily because of the significant range of uncertainty inherent in these changes. With the guidance of stakeholders, we demonstrate a scenario analysis methodology to elucidate the interactions among various components and uncertainties within the food, energy and water systems of the Kenai River Watershed. Alternative scenario analysis provided stakeholders with a venue and process to consider plausible futures in which rates of change in critical uncertainties were modeled to elucidate potential responses. Critical uncertainties ranged from climatic impacts on freshwater systems, to new energy development proposals, to changes in sport and personal use fisheries. Working together, stakeholders developed narratives that reflected different combinations of future uncertainty to guide potential management actions now and in the future. Five scenarios were developed by stakeholders that capture the complex interactions in the Kenai River Watershed as a social-ecological system. This process provides a way for managers and stakeholders to plan for the future in a richer way than extrapolating trends for obvious drivers of change. We present this framework as a platform for integrating climate, landscape and cultural change data into actionable decisions, crafted by stakeholders, to improve future food, energy and water resource management at the watershed scale.},

abstract={Managing ecosystems for multiple ecosystem services and balancing the well-being of diverse stakeholders involves different kinds of trade-offs. Often trade-offs involve noneconomic and difficult-to-evaluate values, such as cultural identity, employment, the well-being of poor people, or particular species or ecosystem structures. Although trade-offs need to be considered for successful environmental management, they are often overlooked in favor of win-wins. Management and policy decisions demand approaches that can explicitly acknowledge and evaluate diverse trade-offs. We identified a diversity of apparent trade-offs in a small-scale tropical fishery when ecological simulations were integrated with participatory assessments of social-ecological system structure and stakeholders' well-being. Despite an apparent win-win between conservation and profitability at the aggregate scale, food production, employment, and well-being of marginalized stakeholders were differentially influenced by management decisions leading to trade-offs. Some of these trade-offs were suggested to be ``taboo{''} trade-offs between morally incommensurable values, such as between profits and the well-being of marginalized women. These were not previously recognized as management issues. Stakeholders explored and deliberated over trade-offs supported by an interactive ``toy model{''} representing key system trade-offs, alongside qualitative narrative scenarios of the future. The concept of taboo trade-offs suggests that psychological bias and social sensitivity may exclude key issues from decision making, which can result in policies that are difficult to implement. Our participatory modeling and scenarios approach has the potential to increase awareness of such trade-offs, promote discussion of what is acceptable, and potentially identify and reduce obstacles to management compliance.},

abstract={Tundra ecosystems are vulnerable to hydrocarbon development, in part because small-scale, low-intensity disturbances can affect vegetation, permafrost soils, and wildlife out of proportion to their spatial extent. Scaling up to include human residents, tightly integrated arctic social-ecological systems (SESs) are believed similarly susceptible to industrial impacts and climate change. In contrast to northern Alaska and Canada, most terrestrial and aquatic components of West Siberian oil and gas fields are seasonally exploited by migratory herders, hunters, fishers, and domesticated reindeer (Rangifer tarandus L.). Despite anthropogenic fragmentation and transformation of a large proportion of the environment, recent socioeconomic upheaval, and pronounced climate warming, we find the Yamal-Nenets SES highly resilient according to a few key measures. We detail the remarkable extent to which the system has successfully reorganized in response to recent shocks and evaluate the limits of the system's capacity to respond. Our analytical approach combines quantitative methods with participant observation to understand the overall effects of rapid land use and climate change at the level of the entire Yamal system, detect thresholds crossed using surrogates, and identify potential traps. Institutional constraints and drivers were as important as the documented ecological changes. Particularly crucial to success is the unfettered movement of people and animals in space and time, which allows them to alternately avoid or exploit a wide range of natural and anthropogenic habitats. However, expansion of infrastructure, concomitant terrestrial and freshwater ecosystem degradation, climate change, and a massive influx of workers underway present a looming threat to future resilience.},

title={How cybernetics explains institutional failure: A case of Greenland's open-air fish markets},
journal={MARINE POLICY},
year={2020},
volume={117},
number={NA},
pages={NA},
month={JUL},
abstract={Understanding why institutions fail is a major concern for natural resource governance. In systems where resources are managed locally, failure is often attributed to the rules poorly fitting the social-ecological system. But what might also bring failure is the manner with which the rules are `fitted' to the system. This paper argues that the conceptual development of institutional failure could be made more tenable with cybernetics - the science of control and feedback. In our case study and process tracing of a `market' institution (an open-air fish market in Greenland), we show how recently implemented European food safety regulations have generated unintended negative consequences, limiting Inuit access to marine foodstuffs, altering the social characteristics of food exchange, and giving rise to underground markets for marine foods. These outcomes signal the failure of reforms to this market institution, but not necessarily why it failed. We show how cybernetic orders explain institutional failure, focusing on how command-and-control-style decisions to intervene in marine food trading and handling (considered as the first-order cybernetics) fostered public doubt for the scientific expertise underpinning the reforms, and ultimately led to a public rejection and closure of a new, hygienic, multi-million-dollar marketplace for marine foods. We clarify how second-order cybernetic elements - such as legitimacy, reflexivity, co-design, and interaction among governance actors - could have prevented the observed outcome. Our case expands the conceptual development of institutional failure and clarifies how the lens of cybernetics can inform the study and practice of institutional change in fisheries governance.},

abstract={This study intends to give recommendations to the management of Paraty fishery in Brazil through an interplay of local and scientific knowledge. In particular, the objectives are the following: 1) to describe the Paraty fishery; 2) to compare the fishermen's local ecological knowledge with recorded fish landings and previous studies in Paraty; 3) to combine the data on local fishing and on local/Caicara livelihoods with the SES (social-ecological systems) Model. The methods include a systematic survey of fishing in Tarituba and Praia Grande, which are located in the northern end and the central part of the Paraty municipality, respectively. For four days each month, systematic data on catches at landing points were collected, as well as macroscopic gonad analysis data for the fishes Centropomus parallelus and C. undecimalis (snook, robalo), Epinephelus marginatus (grouper, garoupa), Scomberomorus cavalla (King mackerel, cavala), and Lutjanus synagris (Lane snapper, vermelho). Spring and summer are important seasons during which some species reproduce, and the integration of fishing periods for some target species could assist in fishing management through the use of closed seasons. Fishermen could obtain complementary earnings from tourism and from the ``defeso system{''} (closed season including a salary payment) to conserve fishing stocks. The SES model facilitates an understanding of the historical context of fishing, its economic importance for local livelihoods, the constraints from conservation measures that affect fishermen, and the management processes that already exist, such as the defeso. If used to integrate fishing with complementary activities (tourism), such a system could improve the responsibility of fishermen regarding the conservation of fish stocks.},

abstract={Marine ecosystems are in decline. New transformational changes in governance are urgently required to cope with overfishing, pollution, global changes, and other drivers of degradation. Here we explore social, political, and ecological aspects of a transformation in governance of Chile's coastal marine resources, from 1980 to today. Critical elements in the initial preparatory phase of the transformation were (i) recognition of the depletion of resource stocks, (ii) scientific knowledge on the ecology and resilience of targeted species and their role in ecosystem dynamics, and (iii) demonstration-scale experimental trials, building on smaller-scale scientific experiments, which identified new management pathways. The trials improved cooperation among scientists and fishers, integrating knowledge and establishing trust. Political turbulence and resource stock collapse provided a window of opportunity that triggered the transformation, supported by new enabling legislation. Essential elements to navigate this transformation were the ability to network knowledge from the local level to influence the decision-making processes at the national level, and a preexisting social network of fishers that provided political leverage through a national confederation of artisanal fishing collectives. The resultant governance scheme includes a revolutionary national system of marine tenure that allocates user rights and responsibilities to fisher collectives. Although fine tuning is necessary to build resilience of this new regime, this transformation has improved the sustainability of the interconnected social-ecological system. Our analysis of how this transformation unfolded provides insights into how the Chilean system could be further developed and identifies generalized pathways for improved governance of marine resources around the world.},

volume={71},

abstract={Policy makers and resource managers in Hawai'i often look to the ancient Hawaiian system of resource management, known as the ahupua'a -system, as a holistic and sustainable mountains-to-sea model for restoration of social-ecological system health and function. Many components of this ancient system, such as agriculture, aquaculture, and nearshore fishery management, have been documented, studied, and revived in the name of both sustainability and perpetuation of Hawai'i's indigenous culture. One relatively glaring hole in the context of our understanding of this ancient system is management of forest resources on a system (i.e., large-scale plant community) level. Five terms for identified and managed social-ecological zones, wao kanaka, wao la'au, wao nahele, wao kele, and wao akua, were used to delineate GIS layers in the model ahupua'a of Ha'ena. These were then extrapolated across the entire island of Kaua'i. The resulting map indicates that not all ahupua'a on Kaua'i had all five social-ecological zones, which gives valuable insight into how upland regions of the various ahupua'a may have been managed in the ali'i era. This research has implications for contemporary approaches to large-scale biocultural conservation initiatives and other resource management plans that aim toward having broader community support for such efforts. Analysis shows that broad overlap between the ancient system and contemporary management zones exists, which implies that it may be feasible to adapt this ancient approach in the bureaucratic system of the contemporary era.},

abstract={Seagrass beds have historically received little to no management attention, contributing to significant declines in their extent globally. Recently, seagrass beds, and other blue carbon ecosystems, have gained greater manage-ment attention due to their potentially critical role in climate mitigation. Therefore, some countries, such as Belize in 2021, have included blue carbon ecosystems within their Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC). To date, no specific regulations exist to manage seagrass beds in Belize; however, there is a plan to develop a national seagrass policy. In support of this effort and to gain a better understanding of institutions' current knowledge and perceptions regarding seagrass beds and their management, as well their experiences with community engagement, we conducted interviews with six Belizean management institutions (two government departments, four non-government organizations) involved in marine resource management. Respondents perceived seagrass beds as important, identifying climate mitigation and fisheries as critical ecosystem services. They saw the importance of managing and protecting seagrass beds, and identified several direct (e.g., dredging) and indirect (e.g., land-based pollution) threats. Also highlighted were several management challenges, with governance structure identified as a major one; seagrass beds can fall under the purview of several government departments, which has jurisdictional implications. Interviewees discussed challenges and opportunities regarding community engagement, and they desired greater community inclusion within marine resource management at planning and implementation phases. Based on these findings, we build on existing management frameworks to present one that can foster just and equitable seagrass policy, management, and social-ecological outcomes.},

year={2020},
volume={121},

pages={NA},
month={NOV},
abstract={Understanding how institutions operate is crucial to the protection of marine ecosystems and the communities that depend on them. We define institutions as the rules, norms, and practices that govern resource users' interactions with common-pool resources, and recognize that both formal and informal institutions govern marine fisheries around the world. Institutional diversity can enhance social-ecological system resilience by providing multiple ways of responding to change. Identifying institutions and their effects on fishing practices is key to improving management for sustainable fisheries. In this study, we use a mixed methods approach focused on the institutions guiding fishing activities of the Mexican chocolate clam, Megapitaria squalida, in Loreto Bay National Park, Baja California Sur, Mexico. By synthesizing long-term observations and semi-structured interviews with fishers and other key stakeholders, we identify the formal and informal rules and norms governing fishing behavior, explore their effects on fishing practices, and illuminate ways in which formal and informal institutions may work in tandem. We find that both formal and informal institutions shape fishing practices within the chocolate clam fishery. Some reinforce one another, and others are in conflict. The diverse institutions governing the chocolate clam fishery create a complex web of sometimes conflicting rules and social norms that fishers navigate every day. We contend that greater community participation in management, via polycentric and collaborative governance that accounts for and legitimizes local norms in a system like co-management, would foster enhanced sustainability of the chocolate clam fishery and the benefits it provides to coastal communities.},

journal={LAND},
year={2018},

number={3},
pages={NA},
month={SEP},
abstract={Due to the fact that the South Africa's savanna landscapes are under changing conditions, the previously sustainable firewood collection system in rural areas has become a social-ecological factor in questions about landscape management. While the resilience of savannas in national parks such as Kruger National Park (KNP) in South Africa has been widely acknowledged in ecosystem management, the resilience of woody vegetation outside protected areas has been underappreciated. Collecting wood is the dominant source of energy for rural households, and there is an urgent need for land management to find sustainable solutions for this complex social-ecological system. However, the firewood collection scenario is only one example, and stands for all human-ecosystem service interactions under the topic of over-utilization, e.g., fishery, grazing, harvesting. Agent-based modeling combined with goal-oriented action planning (GOAP) can provide fresh insights into the relationship between individual needs of humans and changes in land use. At the same time, this modeling approach includes adaptive behavior under changing conditions. A firewood collection scenario was selected for a proof-of-concept comprising households, collectors, ecosystem services and firewood sites. Our results have shown that, even when it is predictable what a single human agent will do, massive up-scaling is needed in order to understand the whole complexity of social-ecological systems. Under changing conditions, such as climate and an increasing population, fair distribution of natural goods become an important issue.},

abstract={Mud crabs (Scylla serrata) are the most conspicuous and commercially important portunid species in the Indo-Pacific mangroves. In Indian Sundarban mangrove, mud crabs are valuable bioresource that contributed economically for the coastal communities. The majority of the crab fishers use traditional methods with minimal investment and without any restriction, resulting unregulated fishery practices. The present study aims to identify the status of crab fishery following ecological and social aspects over three year's data series. Monthly samplings were conducted in seven fishing villages of Sundarban having similar principle livelihood and socio-cultural makeup. The population structure, abundance, biomass and sex-ratio of the crabs were recorded each month. The organization of local marketing chain was analyzed. Daily and monthly catch in different traditional fishing techniques were compared. Based on the three years survey data a conceptual framework of future management strategy had also been developed. Six different size classes were identified during the study. Ovigerous ratio and juvenile recruitment of the population showed distinct peaks. Two major fishing techniques were identified which are practiced traditionally by the local communities. They differed in terms of size-specific collection, catch per unit effort and hours of activities for the crab collectors. Maximum exploitation of the wild population was observed in the case of mangrove-fringed villages. Due to the recent increasing demands of mud crabs in domestic and international markets, the natural stock is continually been depleted. Therefore, involvement of the resource extractors into the future management trajectories is necessary to overcome the present crisis. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Managing trade-offs among water uses in a river basin to sustain multiple ecosystem services is crucial for adaptation to changing river flow regimes. Here we analyze the trade-off between irrigation and fisheries in the Amudarya, a semi-arid river basin in Central Asia, using an optimal control and an agent-based modeling approach. With the optimal control approach (OCA), we identify the economic and ecological conditions for water sharing in a regime where a social manager controls water withdrawals and fish harvesting. With the agent-based model (ABM), we relax some of the assumptions of the OCA to investigate how localized, individual agents with varied water use histories adapt their water use activities to local resource conditions. Variation in the farmers' initial labor allocations to the two activities results in regimes with only one activity or both. Global returns and income equality are highest in a mixed regime. The mixed regimes also are more robust to water variability because fishing activities can compensate for decreased agricultural performance in the midstream regions. Thus, allowing for multiple uses can improve the coupled social-ecological system's performance and its resilience. We also observe a lock-in effect similar to the current situation in the Amudarya, where agriculture is the dominant water use and transition to a more balanced allocation has proven to be extremely difficult. As in the ABM, this can to some extent be attributed to the difficulties of achieving sufficient revenues from fishing when agricultural activities upstream are high. Regulations or incentives are needed to overcome those barriers, and to facilitate progress towards integrated water management.},

abstract={We explored the social and ecological outcomes associated with emergence of a management panacea designed to govern a stochastic renewable natural resource. To that end, we constructed a model of a coupled social-ecological system of recreational fisheries in which a manager supports naturally fluctuating stocks by stocking fish in response to harvest-driven satisfaction of resource users. The realistic assumption of users remembering past harvest experiences when exploiting a stochastically fluctuating fish population facilitates the emergence of a stocking-based management panacea over time. The social benefits of panacea formation involve dampening natural population fluctuations and generating stability of user satisfaction. It also maintains the resource but promotes the eventual replacement of wild fish by hatchery-descended fish. Our analyses show this outcome is particularly likely when hatchery-descended fish are reasonably fit (e.g., characterized by similar survival relative to wild fish) and/or when natural recruitment of the wild population is low(e.g., attributable to habitat deterioration), which leaves the wild population with little buffer against competition by stocked fish. The potential for release-based panacea formation is particularly likely under user-based management regimes and should be common in a range of social-ecological systems (e.g., fisheries, forestry), whenever user groups are entitled to engage in release or replanting strategies. The net result will be the preservation of a renewable resource through user-based incentives, but the once natural populations are likely to be altered and to host nonnative genotypes. This risks other ecosystem services and the future of wild populations.},

year={2021},
volume={132},

month={OCT},
abstract={Reducing uncertain outcomes of fishery management actions requires an understanding of how fishers will be affected by policy actions. This requires integrating the local expertise of commercial fishers and seafood processors into management planning to predict how regulatory changes could impact social-ecological systems. Participatory modeling between managers, scientists, and industry can be useful in integrating different perspectives and gaining a more comprehensive understanding of how different scenarios can cause direct and indirect impacts throughout fishery systems. We used group Fuzzy Cognitive Mapping exercises to describe the structure and dynamics of two economically important commercial fishery systems in Alaska, USA: the Bering Sea Pollock Catcher/Processor and Amendment 80 Groundfish fishery. Several components were identified by the fleets that had a relatively high number of links to other components in each system, including chum salmon catch for the pollock fleet and the deck sorting of halibut for the groundfish fleet. After identifying other critical relationships between regulatory, environmental, and operational changes, we developed a survey technique and regression analytical approach to define the shape of these relationships. Our results show both linear and nonlinear relationships between bycatch regulations and fishing operations; thus, providing evidence counter to the traditional assumption that the relationships between policy and fishing operations are always linear and constant across variable levels of change. Our novel approach permits for more specific explorations of curvilinear patterns, social tipping points, and asymptotic limits to change, thereby allowing for improved assessments of the effects of regulatory and environmental change on fishing communities.},

month={NA},
abstract={Diagnosing causal factors of change at the ecosystem level is challenging because multiple drivers often interact at various spatial and temporal scales. We employ an integrated natural and social science approach to assess potential mechanisms leading to the collapse of an estuarine social-ecological system, and recommend future paths to increased system resilience. Our case study is the collapse of the eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) fishery in Apalachicola Bay, Florida, USA, and the associated impacts on local resource dependent communities. The oyster fishery collapse is the most recent in a series of environmental stressors to this region, which have included hurricanes and tropical storms, drought, and the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. We found it likely that the oyster collapse was not related to contamination from the recent oil spill, but rather to factors affecting oyster recruitment and survival, which may have been mediated by both human, e.g., fishing-related habitat alteration, and environmental, e.g., increased natural mortality from predators and disease, factors. The relative impact of each of these factors is likely to increase in the future because of changing climate and increased demand for fishery, water, and petroleum resources. Successful restoration and persistence of a viable oyster fishery will depend on: (1) implementation of some minimal best management practices, e.g., extensive habitat restoration via shell addition, and some spatial closures to harvest, (2) improving environmental knowledge and promoting episodic learning through enhanced monitoring and experimental management, and (3) continued community engagement necessary to produce adaptable governance suitable to responding to future unexpected challenges.},

volume={2},
number={5-6},
pages={356-363},
month={DEC},
abstract={A broad marine policy goal is to maintain healthy marine social-ecological systems that sustain desirable ecosystem services and support human livelihoods. Marine social-ecological systems are already stressed by a number of environmental factors and the impacts of globalisation. Climate change is an additional stress that may push marine social-ecological systems beyond the ranges of past variability to which they have become adapted. Human social systems have well-developed strategies for dealing with variability within their normal ranges of experience, although these capacities are not distributed homogeneously around the globe. This paper addresses the additional impacts of climate change on marine social-ecological systems that are focussed around fishing. For example, human social fishing systems dealing with high variability upwelling systems with rapidly reproducing fish species may have greater capacities to adjust to the additional stress of climate change than human social fishing systems focussed on longer-lived and generally less variable species. The details of local impacts of climate change and its interactions with existing stresses on marine social-ecological systems are difficult to predict but will lead to more extreme events and increased uncertainty. Management must strive to enhance the adaptive capacities of these systems to uncertainty and change. Primary challenges are to address non-climate change stresses such as overfishing and how they may interact with climate change to produce surprises, and to recognise that multiple interacting time, space and organisational scales make identification and resolution of impacts difficult. Additional challenges are to develop integrated observing and modelling systems for the full social-ecological system so as to quickly recognise changes, to enhance communications with stakeholders, and to develop flexible institutions that can adjust rapidly to new circumstances.},

abstract={The mitigation hierarchy has been proposed as an overarching framework for managing fisheries and reducing marine megafauna bycatch, but requires empirical application to show its practical utility. Focusing on a small-scale fishing community in Peru as a case study system, we test how the mitigation hierarchy can support efforts to reduce captures of sea turtles in gillnets and link these actions to broader goals for biodiversity. We evaluate three management scenarios by drawing on ecological risk assessment (ERA) and qualitative management strategy evaluation to assess trade-offs between biological, economic, and social considerations. The turtle species of management focus include leatherback turtle Dermochelys coriacea, green turtle Chelonia mydas, and olive ridley turtle Lepidochelys olivacea. Adopting a mixed-methods iterative approach to data collection, we undertook a literature review to collate secondary data on the fishery and the species of turtles captured. We then collected primary data to fill the knowledge gaps identified, including establishing the spatial extent of the fishery and calculating turtle capture rates for the fishery. We identified and evaluated the potential risk that the fishery poses to each turtle species within Pacific East regional management units using a qualitative ERA. Finally, we evaluated potential management strategies to reduce turtle captures, incorporating stakeholder preference from questionnaire-based surveys and considering preliminary estimates of trends across a range of performance indicators. We illustrate how the proposed framework can integrate existing knowledge on an issue of marine megafauna captures, and incorporate established decision-making processes to help identify data gaps. This supports a holistic assessment of management strategies toward biodiversity goals standardized across fisheries and scales.},

abstract={Governing common pool resources (CPR) in the face of disturbances such as globalization and climate change is challenging. The outcome of any CPR governance regime is the influenced by local combinations of social, institutional, and biophysical factors, as well as cross-scale interdependencies. In this study, we take a step towards understanding multiple-causation of CPR outcomes by analyzing (1) the co-occurrence of design principles (DPs) by activity (irrigation, fishery and forestry), and (2) the combination(s) of DPs leading to social and ecological success. We analyzed 69 cases pertaining to three different activities: irrigation, fishery, and forestry. We find that the importance of the design principles is dependent upon the natural and hard human made infrastructure (i.e. canals, equipment, vessels etc.). For example, clearly defined social boundaries are important when the natural infrastructure is highly mobile (i.e. tuna fish), while monitoring is more important when the natural infrastructure is more static (i.e. forests or water contained within an irrigation system). However, we also find that congruence between local conditions and rules and proportionality between investment and extraction are key for CPR success independent from the natural and human hard made infrastructure. We further provide new visualization techniques for co-occurrence patterns and add to qualitative comparative analysis by introducing a reliability metric to deal with a large meta-analysis dataset on secondary data where information is missing or uncertain.},

abstract={Understanding the cross-scale nature of how natural resource trading links to local extraction patterns remains a topic of great relevance to stewardship and sustainable use of ecological systems. Microeconomic influences on a society's pattern of small-scale natural resources utilization can exacerbate resource overuse, especially under increased population pressure. In many rural communities that are based on a limited diversity of resource industries, quantifying the response of extractors and traders to market and environmental fluctuations is critical to understanding management constraints. We examine the fishing practices of a small lake in Uganda, East Africa, from the dual perspectives of the traders and the fishers using a Bayesian Belief Network approach based on detailed interview surveys. Fishers in this small lake target Nile perch (Lates niloticus) and Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), two fish species of high commercial and food security significance in East Africa. We combined data on financial, social, and ecological systems to understand how aspects of trading quantitatively relate to fish extraction patterns in Lake Nabugabo Uganda. Importantly, we find that the patron-client type relationships generate incentives to extract specific fish, whereas ``freelancer{'' independent fishers are able to create responsive and flexible extraction practices that match market and environmental fluctuations. Management of fishing administered by local Beach Management Units will likely have a higher probability of success when in synchrony with trading relationships and ecological dynamics. We use this study in Uganda to reflect on methodological challenges and opportunities of combining multiple types of data sets for cross-scale analysis of social-ecological system dynamics.},

volume={220},

month={APR},
abstract={Recovering endangered species populations when confronted with the threat of invasive species is an ongoing natural resource management challenge. While eradication of the invasive species is often the optimal economic solution, it may not be a feasible nor desirable management action in other cases. For example, when invasive species are desired in one area, but disperse into areas managed for endangered species, managers may be interested in persistent, but cost-effective means of managing dispersers rather than eradicating the source. In the Colorado River, a nonnative rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) sport fishery is desired within Glen Canyon National Recreation Area, however, dispersal downriver into the Grand Canyon National Park is not desired as rainbow trout negatively affect endangered humpback chub (Gila cypha). Here, we developed a bioeconomic model incorporating population abundance goals and cost-effectiveness analyses to approximate the optimal control strategies for invasive rainbow trout conditional on achieving endangered humpback chub adult population abundance goals. Model results indicated that the most cost-effective approach to achieve target adult humpback chub abundance was a high level of rainbow trout control over moderately high rainbow trout population abundance. Adult humpback chub abundance goals were achieved at relatively low rainbow trout abundance and control measures were not cost-effective at relatively high rainbow trout abundance. Our model considered population level dynamics, species interaction and economic costs in a multi-objective decision framework to provide a preferred solution to long-run management of invasive and native species.},

journal={THEORETICAL ECOLOGY},
year={2020},
volume={13},
number={3},
pages={425-434},
month={SEP},
abstract={The monitoring of ecosystems and the spread of information concerning their state among human stakeholders is often a lengthy process. The importance of mutual feedbacks between socioeconomic and ecological dynamics is being increasingly recognised in recent studies, but it is generally assumed that the feedback from the environment is instantaneous, ignoring any delay in the spread of ecosystem knowledge and the resulting potential for system stability loss. On the other hand, human actors rarely make purely myopic socioeconomic decisions as is often assumed. Rather, they show a degree of foresight for future utility which may have an opposing, stabilising effect to any delay in knowledge. In this paper, we consider a generic resource-harvester model with delayed ecosystem knowledge and predictive behaviour by the harvesters. We show that delays in the spread of information about the resource level can destabilise the bioeconomic equilibrium in the system and induce harvesting cycles or the collapse of the resource. Sufficiently farsighted prediction by the harvesters can stabilise the system, provided the delay is not too long. However, if the time horizon of prediction is too long relative to the timescale of resource growth, prediction can be destabilising even in the absence of delay. The results imply that effective monitoring of ecosystems and fast dissemination of the results are necessary for their sustainable use and that efforts to promote appropriate foresight among ecosystem users on the personal and institutional level would be beneficial to the stability of coupled socioeconomic-ecological systems.},

title={From typhoons to traders: the role of patron-client relations in mediating fishery responses to natural disasters},
journal={ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
year={2019},
volume={14},
number={4},
pages={NA},
month={APR},
abstract={The majority of the world's fishers, fishworkers and their dependents live in coastal tropical areas that are, and will be, highly exposed to human-induced climate change. Projections indicate such change could result in coastal populations being more frequently and acutely impacted by natural disasters. Increasing aid interventions is a likely knock-on effect of such scenarios. How these external natural and social disturbances interact and affect local fisheries and small-scale producers is in part determined by the internal dynamics of the social-ecological system (SES). Economic vulnerability often characterizes communities in these settings and influences the means with which they navigate changes. The patron-client system is prolific in many rural economies and small-scale fisheries. It forms a central element in the organization of market interactions and often provides much needed finance for low-income households in place of formal options. How such injection of capital promotes individuals' ability to buffer income fluctuations at the expense of long-term sustainability of the broader fishery system is still an area in need of examination. This paper contributes to shed light on this issue by using a case study approach to trace the historical development of the fishery system in the Iloilo Province (Philippines) in relation to a major natural disaster-super-typhoon Haiyan, known locally as Yolanda-and the subsequent aid intervention that followed. The aim is to assess how the patron-client system filtered these two related disturbances and to highlight the resulting tensions between short-term individual resilience and longer-term SES sustainability.},

abstract={The benefits provided by a healthy ocean are receiving increasing attention in policy and management spheres. A fundamental challenge with assessing ocean health and ecosystem services is that we lack a scientific framework for expressing ecosystem conditions quantitatively in relation to management goals. Here we outline and operationalize a conceptual framework for identifying meaningful reference points and quantifying the current ecosystem state relative to them. The framework requires clear articulation of management goals and is built on a review of current scientific understanding and assessment of data availability. It develops a structured approach for choosing among three classes of reference points, including: (1) functional relationships that establish the ocean state that can be produced and sustained under different environmental conditions, (2) time series approaches that compare current to previous capacities to obtain a particular ocean state in a specific location, and (3) spatial reference points that compare current capacities to achieve a desired ocean state across regional (or, if necessary, global) scales. We illustrate this general framework through the lens of ocean health defined in terms of a coupled social-ecological system, with examples from fisheries, marine livelihoods, and water quality in the USA. Assessment of ocean health and ecosystem services can be significantly influenced by the choice of indicators used to track changes in a management goal, the type of reference point selected, and how one measures the distance of the current state from the reference point. This framework provides flexible, standardized methods for evaluating ocean health and ecosystem services that can advance important components of ecosystem-based management, including marine spatial planning, ecosystem service valuation, and integrated ecosystem assessments.},

abstract={Spawning aggregations are critical for the resilience of some coral reef fish populations and for the sustainability of many coastal fisheries. However, overexploitation of these aggregations is leading to a rapid decline of fish stocks. The fish aggregation site (FAS) associated with the San Felipe Keys National Park (in southwestern Cuba) is of great importance for the conservation of northern Caribbean snapper. An assessment of the pressure which fishing is placing on these populations, however, has not to date been conducted. To characterize the fishing use of San Felipe Keys FAS, data pertaining to five snapper species were evaluated in 2014. Samples consisted of 3879 individuals collected from 80 catch samples from commercial and sport fishing modalities. Catch assessment was performed using indicators based on length-frequency data (minimum legal size, length at first maturity, optimal length and average size of catch) and on fisheries effort data (seasonal and spatial yield by different modalities). To identify whether individuals were caught before or after spawning, the stage of gonads was analyzed. Individuals with sizes below the maturity length and with mature gonads before spawning prevailed in the five species, with Luyanus analis and L. cyanopterus being the most affected. The government commercial fishing fleet had the highest volume of catches and the largest impact. The indicators suggest that the current use of this FAS may impede the effective preservation of reproductive capacity of the population. Therefore, management and conservation initiatives of this FAS are urgently needed to maintain the sustain ability and resilience of the coralline social-ecological system.},

volume={88},

pages={213-221},
month={FEB},
abstract={Fostering sustainable local social ecological interactions playing out against a backdrop of larger-scale dynamics are ubiquitous challenges to natural resource management and biodiversity conservation. Social-ecological vulnerability assessments are highly relevant for place-based management and can help target and prioritize management actions. However, an understanding of how linked social-ecological vulnerabilities respond to external drivers is still lacking. This paper presents an approach that integrates the spatial and temporal dimensions into social-ecological vulnerability assessments, where social and ecological vulnerabilities are linked by a feedback loop. The approach is applied to the Moorea coral reef social-ecological system, which has been significantly influenced by major environmental and social drivers over the last decade. Temporal changes in linked social-ecological vulnerabilities are mapped before and after exposure to the multiple drivers. Nearly 23\% of households and 13\% of the reef area show low and decreasing vulnerability despite exposure. However, high and increasing levels of vulnerability were detected in 6\% of households and associated reefs after exposure to the drivers, providing early warnings of potentially unsustainable situations. Importantly, changes in ecological vulnerability did not propagate linearly to changes in social vulnerability. Similarly, hot spots of social vulnerability were not necessarily associated with hot spots of ecological vulnerability, highlighting the need to specifically adapt management interventions to local social-ecological settings. Mapping social-ecological dependencies in space and time provides communities and decision-makers with the information required to identify and prioritize management interventions while accounting for the effects of large-scale or external drivers.},

abstract={We investigated the relative roles of natural factors and shoreline harvest leading to recent declines of the black leather chiton (Katharina tunicata) on the outer Kenai Peninsula, Alaska (USA). This intertidal mollusk is a strongly interacting grazer and a culturally important subsistence fishery for Sugpiaq (Chugach Alutiiq) natives. We took multiple approaches to determine causes of decline. Field surveys examined the significant predictors of Katharina density and biomass across 11 sites varying in harvest pressure, and an integrated analysis of archaeological faunal remains, historical records, traditional ecological knowledge, and contemporary subsistence invertebrate landings examined changes in subsistence practices through time. Strong evidence suggests that current spatial variation in Katharina density and biomass is driven by both human exploitation and sea otter (Enhydra lutris) predation. Traditional knowledge, calibrated by subsistence harvest data, further revealed that several benthic marine invertebrates (sea urchin, crab, clams, and cockles) have declined serially beginning in the 1960s, with reduced densities and sizes of Katharina being the most recent. The timing of these declines was coincident with changes in human behavior (from semi-nomadic to increasingly permanent settlement patterns, improved extractive technologies, regional commercial crustacean exploitation, the erosion of culturally based season and size restrictions) and with the reestablishment of sea otters. We propose that a spatial concentration in shoreline collection pressure through time, increased harvest efficiency, and the serial depletion of alternative marine invertebrate prey have led to intensified per capita predator impacts on Katharina and thus its recent localized decline.},

abstract={Here we present quantitative projections of potential futures for ecosystems in the North Atlantic basin generated from coupling a climate change-driven biophysical model (representing ecosystem and fish populations under climate change) and a scenario-driven ecological-economic model (representing fleets and industries under economic globalization). Four contrasting scenarios (Baseline, Fortress, Global Commons, Free Trade) were defined from the perspective of alternative regional management and governance of the oceanic basin, providing pathways for the future of ecosystems in the Northeast Atlantic basin by 2040. Results indicate that in the time frame considered: (I) the effects of governance and trade decisions are more significant in determining outcomes than the effects of climate change alone, (2) climate change is likely to result in a poleward latitudinal shift of species ranges and thus resources, with implications for exploitation patterns, (3) the level of fisheries regulation is the most important factor in determining the long term evolution of the fisheries system, (4) coupling climate change and governance impacts demonstrates the complex interaction between different components of this social-ecological system, (5) an important driver of change for the future of the North Atlantic and the European fishing fleets appears to be the interplay between wild fisheries and aquaculture development, and finally (6) scenarios demonstrate that the viability and profit of fisheries industries is highly volatile. This study highlights the need to explore basin-scale policy that combines medium to long-term environmental and socio-economic considerations, and the importance of defining alternative sustainable pathways.

abstract={How to create and adjust governing institutions so that they align (fit) with complex ecosystem processes and structures across scales is an issue of increasing concern in conservation. It is argued that lack of such social-ecological fit makes governance and conservation difficult, yet progress in explicitly defining and rigorously testing what constitutes a good fit has been limited. We used a novel modeling approach and data from case studies of fishery and forest conservation to empirically test presumed relationships between conservation outcomes and certain patterns of alignment of social-ecological interdependences. Our approach made it possible to analyze conservation outcome on a systems level while also providing information on how individual actors are positioned in the complex web of social-ecological interdependencies. We found that when actors who shared resources were also socially linked, conservation at the level of the whole social-ecological system was positively affected. When the scales at which individual actors used resources and the scale at which ecological resources were interconnected to other ecological resources were aligned through tightened feedback loops, conservation outcome was better than when they were not aligned. The analysis of individual actors' positions in the web of social-ecological interdependencies was helpful in understanding why a system has a certain level of social-ecological fit. Results of analysis of positions showed that different actors contributed in very different ways to achieve a certain fit and revealed some underlying difference between the actors, for example in terms of actors' varying rights to access and use different ecological resources.},

abstract={Management of salmonids at local and regional levels in the Baltic, Sea is best analyzed by viewing the Baltic region as a complex social-ecological system. The ecosystem approach, now in an implementation phase in the Baltic Sea region, provides a framework for understanding interdependencies between resources, ecosystems and society, and examining management trade-offs. This study focuses on application of the ecosystem approach to management of two salmonids: the Atlantic salmon Salmo salar fishery in the Baltic Sea region and the brown trout S. trutta recreational fishery in Stockholm archipelago, Sweden. These cases provide illustrative examples of some current trend!; and key challenges for sustainable salmonidae management. The Baltic Sea has low biodiversity and Atlantic salmon is one of the few commercially or recreationally important fish species. In this region, fish resources and the ecosystems they depend on are shared by nine coastal nations. The different salmon populations spawn in their native rivers but mix in offshore areas where they are harvested by national fishing fleets. In the Baltic, a number of factors have impacted wild salmon populations. Hydropower development in the Baltic coastal states has led to declines in wild salmon populations and, to compensate, annual stocked fish releases. In attractive coastal areas such as the Stockholm archipelago in Sweden, increased recreational fishing has led to a shift in user patterns from small-scale commercial fisheries by islanders towards a heterogeneous group of visiting recreational fishers. Efforts to reorganize fisheries management institutions in the Baltic Sea region indicate the need to consider the full range of user groups, develop coherent multilevel management institutions, and achieve a better understanding of the role of diverse fish populations in the ecosystem.},

title={A social-ecological systems perspective on dried fish value chains},
journal={CURRENT RESEARCH IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY},
year={2022},
volume={4},
number={NA},
pages={NA},
month={NA},
abstract={Small-scale fisheries (SSF) support over 90\% of the 120 million people engaged in fisheries globally. Dried fish is an important sub-sector of SSF, which is characterized by declining social, economic, political conditions of people involved in its production, and the ecosystems they depend on. Dried fish accounts for 12\% of the total fish consumption globally but can increase up to 36\% in low-income countries. About half of the people involved in dried fish production and marketing are women. The approach taken to analyse dried fish sector has so far followed a narrow subset of commodity chain approaches with a focus on financial value, transmitted in a linear `vertical' fashion across value chain actors. Existing value chain approach fails to factor the non-capital re-lationships of dried fish that are contingent upon specific histories, ecologies, peoples, places, and the practices. The narrow neoclassical economic perspective of dried fish value chain (DFVC) also impedes appropriate re-sponses to their unique attributes pertaining to social, ecological, institutional interactions across multiple scales. Failure to consider social-ecological system (SES) attributes, its connections and relationships with dried fish value chain not only undermine social wellbeing of upstream actors but also perpetuates social-environmental inequity and injustice. The paper offers a novel SES-oriented DFVC perspective that focuses on social well-being of fishers and dried fish workers. The reconceptualisation of structure, conduct and performance of DFVC is done by conducting an interdisciplinary analysis of peer-reviewed literature from SES, value chain and social wellbeing.},

abstract={While the benefits humans gain from ecosystem functions and processes are critical in natural resource-dependent societies with persistent poverty, ecosystem services as a pathway out of poverty remain an elusive goal, contingent on the ecosystem and mediated by social processes. Here, we investigate three emerging dimensions of the ecosystem service-poverty relationship: economic contribution of provisioning ecosystem services to the household livelihood mix, social-ecological systems producing different bundles of ecosystem services and material wealth versus reported life satisfaction. We analyse these relationships in Bangladesh, using data from a bespoke 1586-household survey, stratified by seven social-ecological systems in the delta coastal region. We create poverty lines to ensure comparability with traditional poverty measures that overlook environmental factors and subjective measurements of well-being. We find that any contribution of ecosystem service-based income to the livelihood mix decreases the likelihood of the incidence of poverty, and of individuals reporting dissatisfaction. We find no relationship between the incidence of material poverty and the specific social-ecological systems, from agriculture to fishery-dominated systems. However, the probability of the household head being dissatisfied was significantly associated with social-ecological system. Individuals living in areas dominated by export-oriented shrimp aquaculture reported lower levels of life satisfaction as an element of their perceived well-being. These results highlight the need for social policy on poverty that accounts for the diversity of outcomes across social-ecological systems, including subjective as well as material dimensions of well-being. National poverty reduction that degrades ecosystem services can have negative implications for the subjective well-being of local populations.},

abstract={Social resilience is an essential aspect of sustainability in environmental management, especially in poor resource-dependent communities. To better understand the dynamics of social resilience, we have conducted a primarily qualitative study of communities dependent on hilsa fishing in two coastal villages in southern Bangladesh. This study applies concepts of social-ecological system (SES), social resilience and co-management in outlining our qualitative data and framing its interpretation. Our findings show that while the establishment of hilsa sanctuary areas has enhanced the previously low ecological sustainability of local small-scale fishing, the management of this program has challenged the social resilience of hilsa fishers by creating new inequalities in the distribution of power and privilege, in terms of the ways in which seasonal fishing bans are enforced and compensation for income loss during the ban periods is distributed. Based on our findings, we suggest specific measures for strengthening social resilience at the local level, including building community networks, developing community infrastructures, updating existing rules and regulations, providing alternative means of generating income for fishers during the crisis periods (e.g. natural disasters and fishing ban periods) and more active sharing of responsibility between stakeholders and government for management of the hilsa fishery. These findings are also applicable to understanding the issues beyond rules and regulations that co-management arrangements need to address in order to be successful and to enhancing the function of co-management arrangements in improving social resilience within resource-dependent communities.},

journal={ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
year={2011},
volume={16},
number={1},
pages={NA},
month={NA},
abstract={A fundamental feature of the Anthropocene is the inexorable erosion of the self-repairing capacity or adaptive renewal of natural systems because of natural perturbation, exploitation, or management failure. The concept of resilience offers a systematic framework for understanding the dynamics and variables that govern response dynamics of ecosystems. Resilience of haplochromine cichlids is assessed using limnological and biodiversity changes in Lake Victoria, the world's second largest freshwater lake, over the last five decades. The review explores the resurgence of the haplochromine cichlids using Holling's adaptive renewal cycle and attempts to illustrate how resilience-based management approaches might learn from an inadvertent management experiment. The introduction in the 1980s of the Nile perch (Lates niloticus), a fecund and voracious predator of the endemic phytoplankton feeding haplochromine cichlids, anthropogenic eutrophication, and deep water hypoxia have combined in a synergistic way to increase the vulnerability of the lake ecosystem to perturbations that were hitherto absorbed. However, the upsurge in commercial Nile perch fishing appears to be enabling the resurgence of the haplochromine cichlids. The resurgence of haplochromine cichlids is characterized by phenotypic plasticity, ecological and life history traits and demonstrates the critical role of response diversity in the maintenance of systems resilience. Resilience of the haplochromine cichlids resides in the requisite functional response diversity and habitat diversity that provide the resources for renewal and regeneration. This paper concludes that management of Nile perch fisheries and control of nutrient loading into Lake Victoria could halt or reverse eutrophication, hence offer the best promise for a diverse, productive, and resilient social-ecological system.},

month={MAY},
abstract={Key elements of the rapidly expanding field of ecosystem-based management include: (a) understanding connections among social and ecological systems and (b) developing analytical approaches to inform the necessary trade-offs among ecosystem services and human activities in coastal and marine areas. To address these needs, we investigate the impacts of multiple economic sectors on the marine ecosystem and dependent human community in the Gulf of California with an ecological-economic model. We focus on the spotted rose snapper (Lutjanus guttatus), an economically important species targeted concurrently by the nearshore artisanal fleet, the sportfishing fleet, and by the industrial shrimp fleet as bycatch. Economic returns to the local community are driven by the artisanal fishery catch and the number of tourists who engage in the sportsfishery, and these variables are in turn impacted by fish abundance. We find that the coexistence of the two sectors (and production of both seafood and tourism services) creates stability in key elements of the coupled systems. When the coupled systems are perturbed by changes in exploitation and climate variability, the artisanal fishery responds more rapidly and to a greater degree than the sportsfishery to shifts in the fish population. Our results suggest that vital components of coupled systems may well respond differently to climate variability or other perturbations, and that management strategies should be developed with this in mind. Models like ours can facilitate the development and testing of hypotheses about the form and strength of interactions between ecosystems, services, and the human communities that rely on them.},

abstract={Understanding the long-term dynamics of social-ecological systems is critical to better inform sustainable management. Since Holling's adaptive cycle heuristic, published in 2001, substantial progress has been made to explore historical changes in agricultural, pastoral, and forest systems. However, the application of this heuristic in coastal fishery systems has been relatively rare. Using the Tam Giang Lagoon in Vietnam as an example of a rapidly changing environment, we explore the historical behavior of this tropical coastal social-ecological system (SES), associated livelihood pathways, and possible challenges for future livelihood adaptations through the lens of the adaptive cycle metaphor. Our analysis demonstrates that the present lagoon SES condition is the result of a series of historical events and reorganization attempts through two complete adaptive cycles. The lagoon's future vulnerability is tied to the intensification of human uses, prolonged ecological degradation, and intensifying climatic hazards. We show how the evolution of the lagoon SES resulted in divergent livelihood pathways that bring benefits to some users but also cause persistent constraints and sometimes irreversible losses to other users in shared common pool resources. A one-size-fits-all fishery management approach is therefore ill-suited for improving diverse livelihoods. We recommend that fishery policies take seriously the heterogeneity in livelihood pathways for sustainable lagoon management. We end by reflecting on the usefulness of the adaptive cycle heuristic in systematically exploring historical dynamics and identifying underlying drivers and feedbacks between the social and ecological components of complex fishery systems.},

title={Fair trade fish: consumer support for broader seafood sustainability},
journal={FISH AND FISHERIES},
year={2016},
volume={17},
number={3},
pages={825-838},
month={SEP},
abstract={Sustainable seafood initiatives began with efforts to promote and certify seafood sourced from well-managed stocks caught with a reduced impact on the marine environment. More recently, social equity in fisheries has been the subject of increased concern with suggestions that seafood cannot be certified as sustainable if its production results in social harm, such as unfair wages or the use of forced or child labour. Together with local seafood, which has been promoted as an eco-friendly and socially conscious alternative to globally sourced seafood, these initiatives signal a growing interest in fisheries as a social-ecological system. However, this increasingly complex landscape of environmental sustainability and social justice may be difficult for the public and seafood consumers to navigate. Here, we investigate consumer understanding of and responsiveness to a range of seafood sustainability initiatives by testing preferences and willingness to pay (WTP) for seafood across the three types of sustainability: ecological sustainability, local origin and social sustainability. More than half of respondents demonstrated good understandings of both ecological sustainability and social sustainability with respect to seafood, and respondents were willing to pay more for all three types of sustainability. However, WTP for social sustainability benefits was the lowest, and consumers perceived a high degree of overlap of these benefits with those from locally sourced seafood. These results indicate that seafood certification taking a system-wide approach has potential to succeed, but that it will need to emerge in concert with the increased public education about social problems associated with globalized fisheries.},

volume={36},
number={1},
pages={278-285},
month={JAN},
abstract={There are considerable efforts by governments, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and academia to integrate marine conservation initiatives and customary practices, such as taboos that limit resource use. However, these efforts are often pursued without a fundamental understanding of customary institutions. This paper examines the operational rules in use and the presence of institutional design principles in long-enduring and dynamic customary fisheries management institutions in Papua New Guinea, Indonesia, and Mexico. Rather than a ``blue print{''} for devising long-enduring institutions, this study relies on the design principles as a starting point to organize an inquiry into the institutional diversity found in customary governance regimes. Three important trends emerged from this comparative analysis: (1) despite it being notoriously difficult to define boundaries around marine resources, almost 3/4 of the cases in this study had clearly defined boundaries and membership; (2) all of the customary institutions were able to make and change rules, indicating a critical degree of flexibility and autonomy that may be necessary for adaptive management; (3) the customary institutions examined generally lacked key interactions with organizations operating at larger scales, suggesting that they may lack the institutional embeddedness required to confront some common pool resources (CPR) challenges from the broader socioeconomic, institutional and political settings in which they are embedded. Future research will be necessary to better understand how specific institutional designs are related to social and ecological outcomes in commons property institutions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={The Columbia River Basin is a complex social-ecological system, spanning political, legal, socio-economic, geographic, and biophysical boundaries. Outreach to others in social networks develops fundamental communications needed for sustainable collaborations in adaptive management. However, operationalizing and comparing measures of social processes and outcome success in biophysical indicators remains challenging for resource managers. Using survey-based research, we examined the interactions for water resource governance of five Columbia River reservoir basins in the northwestern US and Canada: Lakes Chelan, Roosevelt, Pend Oreille, Koocanusa, and clq'etkw (Flathead). Respondents included: water resource professionals working for Tribes/First Nations, federal, state, or provincial departments in water quality and/or fisheries, and people who engage in the networks on behalf of area businesses, government offices, public services, non-profit organizations, and other entities. Perceived social process metrics in these governance networks included the levels of collaboration and inclusiveness, common goals, common strategies, identifying issues, implementing action, and the adequacy of available scientific data. We evaluated social measures relative to participant-reported changes in physical lake health indicators. Qualitative data-enhanced understanding of basin-specific differences. Correlations of social by ecological measures varied widely between basins. Even moderate to strong functionality parameters did not scale well from individual to cross-basin levels, as many correlations vanished with data aggregated. However, data analysis at the basin scale revealed important variability across the region in scope and governance functionality. Process indicators such as identifying issues and implementing action yielded stronger relationships for 10-year horizons than for 2 years, reflecting the lag-time in resource action.},

journal={MARINE POLICY},
year={2020},
volume={121},
number={NA},
pages={NA},
month={NOV},
abstract={Small-scale fisheries (SSFs), which provide an important source of livelihood for many coastal communities, are at risk from climate change. Benthic organisms are likely to be particularly affected by the impacts of climate change due to their low spatial mobility, which limits their capacity for adaptation. Therefore, SSFs that target sedentary resources ({''}S-fisheries{''}) will potentially be among the most impacted types of fishery. The pathways of such impacts can be studied in an integrated approach by means of social-ecological vulnerability assessment. The stalked barnacle (Pollicipes pollicipes) fishery, one of the most important S-fisheries in Galicia (NW Spain), represents a complex social-ecological system rooted within the culture of the region. Along Galician coast, this benthic resource is co-managed by the territorial use rights in fisheries (TURFs) scheme. The vulnerability assessment involves ranking TURF systems according to the exposure of the resource to climate hazards, the sensitivity of dependent people and the capacity of the system to adapt to the impacts. After analyzing 26 stalked barnacle TURFs (79\% of all Galician TURFs), we identified the most vulnerable zones (Muxia and O Pindo), as indicated by high levels of ecological vulnerability and social sensitivity and low adaptive capacity. We discuss different ways of increasing the adaptive capacity of TURFs based on local knowledge and literature reviews. Vulnerability assessment represents a powerful tool that can be used to help policy-makers develop adaptation strategies needed at different time scales, ultimately contributing towards better informed, sustainable and efficient fisheries management.},

pages={77-86},
month={APR},
abstract={There is an increasing recognition globally of the role to be played by community science-scientific research and monitoring driven and controlled by local communities, and characterized by place-based knowledge, social learning, collective action and empowerment. In particular, community science can support social-ecological system transformation, and help in achieving better `fit' between ecological systems and governance, at local and higher levels of decision making. This paper draws on three examples of communities as central actors in the process of knowledge co-production to present a typology of community science, and to deduce a set of key principles/conditions for success. The typology involves three social learning models in which the community acquires scientific knowledge by (1) engaging with external bodies, (2) drawing on internal volunteer scientific expertise, and/or (3) hiring (or contracting) in-house professional scientific expertise. All of these models share the key characteristic that the local community decides with whom they wish to engage, and in each case, social learning is fundamental. Some conditions that facilitate community science include: community-driven and community-control; flexibility across leadership models; connection to place and collective values; empowerment, agency and collective action; credible trust; local knowledge; and links to governance. Community science is not a panacea for effecting change at the local level, and there is need for critical assessment of how it can help to fill governance gaps. Nevertheless, a considerable body of experience globally illustrates how local communities are drawing effectively on community science for better conservation and livelihood outcomes, in a manner compatible with broader trends toward ecosystem-based management and local stewardship.},

abstract={Although the dynamics of coastal resources are largely determined by the impacts of human users, spatially-explicit social data are rarely systematically integrated into coastal management planning in data-poor developing states. In order to plan a community-based mangrove payments for ecosystem services initiative in southwest Madagascar, we used two participatory approaches; public participation geographic information systems and concept modelling workshops - with 10 coastal communities to investigate the dynamics and spatial distribution of the mangrove resources they use. In each village we conducted participatory mapping of land and resource use with different livelihood groups using printed satellite images, and concept modelling workshops to develop concept models of the mangrove social-ecological system (including the identification of threats and underlying drivers, and proposals for targeted management strategies). Each community then proposed mangrove zoning consisting of strict conservation zones, sustainable use zones and restoration zones. Following validation and ground-truthing, the proposed zones and management strategies formed the basis of the zoning and management plan for the mangrove. Participatory approaches proved a simple and reliable way to gather spatial data and better understand the relationships between the mangrove and those who use it. Moreover, participation stimulated mangrove users to consider resource trends, the impacts of their activities, and required management actions, promoting a collective `buy-in' for the project. Since participation extended beyond research to the development of management zones, rules and strategies, we believe that community ownership of the project has been strengthened and the chances of successfully conserving the mangrove improved.},

month={FEB},
abstract={We examined the principal effects of different information network topologies for local adaptive management of natural resources. We used computerized agents with adaptive decision algorithms with the following three fundamental constraints: (1) Complete understanding of the processes maintaining the natural resource can never be achieved, (2) agents can only learn by experimentation and information sharing, and (3) memory is limited. The agents were given the task to manage a system that had two states: one that provided high utility returns (desired) and one that provided low returns (undesired). In addition, the threshold between the states was close to the optimal return of the desired state. We found that networks of low to moderate link densities significantly increased the resilience of the utility returns. Networks of high link densities contributed to highly synchronized behavior among the agents, which caused occasional large-scale ecological crises between periods of stable and high utility returns. A constructed network involving a small set of experimenting agents was capable of combining high utility returns with high resilience, conforming to theories underlying the concept of adaptive comanagement. We conclude that (1) the ability to manage for resilience (i.e., to stay clear of the threshold leading to the undesired state as well as the ability to re-enter the desired state following a collapse) resides in the network structure and (2) in a coupled social-ecological system, the system-wide state transition occurs not because the ecological system flips into the undesired state, but because managers lose their capacity to reorganize back to the desired state.},

volume={141},

pages={107-117},
month={APR},
abstract={The Maine sea urchin fishery is a classic boom-bust fishery in which efforts to sustain the resource failed despite the creation of a co-management system. We report on ethnographic work undertaken to assist in the development of a fine scale model of the natural system of this fishery. The development of the natural system model required understanding the key linkages between the biology and ecology of the sea urchin and the behavior of fishermen. Information was gathered from the primary scientific literature and from interviews with sea urchin industry members and scientists. Urchin-kelp interactions at a very fine scale create patchy, almost sedentary aggregations of urchins. Settlement of larval urchins appears to be ubiquitous; however, after settlement patches of urchins operate as nearly independent demographic units. In the short term - months to several years - the abundance of urchins in any patch and the spatial dynamics within these patches are determined largely by the actions of fishermen. Consequently, the resource can be characterized as a dynamic fitness landscape in which the spatial structure of urchin patches is the principal determinant of fishermen's harvesting strategies and fishermen's activities are the principal determinant of the spatial structure of urchin patches. While doing the interviews for the natural system model, we developed a fine scale alternative to the usual theoretical explanation of overfishing. The scale of management in the fishery occurs at a much broader scale than the demographically relevant scale of urchin patches. This results in a mismatch of ecological and management scales that leave each patch in the fishery in an open access state, resulting in a very fine scale form of serial overfishing that removes, piece-by-piece, discrete, local aggregations of sea urchins.

title={Understanding Social-Ecological Challenges of a Small-Scale Hilsa (<i>Tenualosa ilisha</i>) Fishery in Bangladesh},

year={2019},
volume={16},

abstract={Small-scale fisheries (SSFs) have been playing a crucial role in meeting the basic needs of millions of people around the world. Despite this, the sustainability of global fisheries is a growing concern, and the factors enabling or constraining the sustainable management of small-scale fisheries remain poorly understood. Hilsa shad (Tenualosa ilisha) is the single most valuable species harvested in Bangladesh waters, serves nutrition, income, and employment to the large population. This study analyzed the state and challenges of hilsa fishery in the Gangetic River systems (Padma and Meghna Rivers) by using two frameworks, namely the social-ecological systems (SES) and drivers-pressure-state-impact-responses (DPSIR) frameworks. Primary data for this analysis were collected by in-depth interviews (n = 130) and focus group discussions (n = 8) with various stakeholders in the hilsa fisheries. The perspectives explored here have been both critical and constructive, including the identification of problems and suggestions for improving the management of this particular social-ecological system. Hilsa fisheries, however, have come under severe threat since 2003 because of population growth, overfishing, pollution, climate change, the disruption of migration routes due to siltation, etc. All these have caused reduced catches and less stable incomes for fishers. This, in turn, has led to poverty, malnutrition, social tensions, stakeholder conflicts, and debt cycles amongst more impoverished fishing communities. These problems have been compounded by improved fishing technology amongst larger-scale ventures, the use of illegal fishing gears, and the non-compliance of government fishery management programs. Recommendations include the promotion of community-supported fisheries, the enhancement of stakeholder's social resilience, the introduction of co-management approach, an increase in incentives and formal financial supports, and possible community-managed sustainable ecotourism including hilsa fishing-based tourism.},

abstract={Property rights are important institutions for regulating the use of valuable natural resources from coastal ecosystems. In this case study, we identify and analyze property rights and user patterns related to small-scale coastal fisheries in the Stockholm Archipelago, Sweden. User patterns and user groups have changed significantly over the last century, as commercial fishing has been increasingly replaced by recreational activities. Interviews with local resource users and owners of water properties in two different areas, Moja and Orno parishes within the Stockholm Archipelago, revealed a very diverse pattern of property and user rights, with a large number of water and fishing rights owners. Recreational fisheries, including both sport and household fishing, seem to predominate in both areas, but ownership differs. In Moja, most waters are collectively owned, whereas in Orno, individual ownership predominates. Very few examples of local influence on fisheries management were found in either area, although the social structure for joint management does exist in Moja. Instead, larger-scale institutions at the regional, national, or international level regulate fisheries, often not addressing local conditions and fish populations. The ongoing shift in resource use has created a heterogeneous user group, and the limitations of centralized management authorities in dealing with the diversity in the coastal ecosystem have created mismatches within the social ecological system. Combined with a large-scale decline in coastal fish stocks, these mismatches challenge the existing local property rights arrangements as well as the more centralized regulatory management structure. A key issue for fisheries management is how to develop and stimulate appropriate distribution of management functions at different geographical scales and organizational levels. The complexity and diversity in archipelago fisheries call for multilevel arrangements and cross-scale coordination, and initiatives have been taken by both central governmental authorities and local user groups to collaborate concerning habitat restoration and protection of important spawning grounds.},

volume={17},

abstract={The Indonesian multi-level governmental program (PITAP) is a participatory pond irrigation management policy established by the Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries. It aims to catalyze the rehabilitation of irrigation canals to improve water access for small-scale aquaculture farmers. In PITAP, traditional aquaculture farmers are incentivized with government funding to create community-based co-management groups (POKLINA), to maintain the self-governance of their irrigation canals. The logic of PITAP is to encourage POKLINA farmers to rehabilitate their irrigation canals through subsidized labor payments that are coupled with strengthening the strong cultural norm of mutual assistance (i.e., collective action) within Indonesian society called Gotong-Royong. PITAP aims to revitalize Gotong-Royong through subsidized labor compensation with the hope that when the subsidy program is over, Gotong-Royong will be revitalized without external support. In this study, we compare and analyze four villages on Lombok, Indonesia, that participated in PITAP program in 2020 and 2021. The study is supported with empirical data using various qualitative data collection methods, including interviews, participant observations, and the collection of policy documents. We further use the Social-Ecological System Framework (SESF) as a diagnostic tool to structure the data collection process and analysis. Findings indicate that different variables hinder and enable collective action in the four villages, leading to different PITAP program outcomes. The likely reason for this, suggested by our findings, is that each village has different social and ecological conditions that influence intrinsic motivation for collective action. PITAP program either crowds out intrinsic motivation under some conditions or crowds it in under others. This suggests the need to consider contextual adaptations in policy design and implementation to improve outcomes better.},

abstract={The 2010 Deepwater Horizon (DwH) disaster challenged the integrity of the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) large-marine ecosystem at unprecedented scales, prompting concerns of devastating injury for GOM fisheries in the post-spill decade. Following the catastrophe, projected economic losses for regional commercial, recreational, and mariculture sectors for the decade after oiling were US\$3.7-8.7 billion overall, owing to the vulnerability of economically prized, primarily nearshore taxa that support fishing communities. State and federal fisheries data during 2000-2017 indicated that GOM fishery sectors appeared to serve as remarkable anchors of resilience following the largest accidental marine oil spill in human history. Evidence of post-disaster impacts on fisheries economies was negligible. Rather, GOM commercial sales during 2010-2017 were US\$0.8-1.5 billion above forecasts derived using pre-spill (2000-2009) trajectories, while pre- and post-spill recreational fishery trends did not differ appreciably. No post-spill shifts in target species or effort distribution across states were apparent to explain these findings. Unraveling the mechanisms for this unforeseen stability represents an important avenue for understanding the vulnerability or resilience of human-natural systems to future disturbances. Following DwH, the causes for fishery responses are likely multifaceted and complex (including exogenous economic forces that typically affect fisheries-dependent data), but appear partially explained by the relative ecological stability of coastal fishery assemblages despite widespread oiling, which has been corroborated by multiple fishery-independent surveys across the northern GOM. Additionally, we hypothesize that damage payments to fishermen led to acquisition or retooling of commercial fisheries infrastructure, and subsequent rises in harvest effort. Combined, these social-ecological dynamics likely aided recovery of stressed coastal GOM communities in the years after DwH, although increased fishing pressure in the post-spill era may have consequences for future GOM ecosystem structure, function, and resilience.},

title={Engaging with complexity in resilience practice},
journal={ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},

pages={NA},
month={OCT},
abstract={In a complex and turbulent world, there is heightened interest in managing for resilience. However, resilience guides, particularly those used in the development field, often lack a theoretical grounding in complex adaptive systems. There is a demand for guidance on how to operationalize complexity in applications of resilience, such as resilience assessment and planning. This study synthesizes lessons from how twelve cases of social-ecological resilience practice are engaging with complexity. We assessed how each case engaged with complexity, according to a framework of six features of complex adaptive systems. The cases are situated in a diversity of contexts, that include rural villages in Tajikistan, a Swedish municipality, Australian catchment management authorities, a Canadian coastal fishery, and the Arctic council. Our results revealed two main ways of engaging with complexity: capturing and making sense of the complexity of a social-ecological system (system complexity) and embodying complexity into the participatory process (process complexity). Our comparison demonstrates that resilience practice provides a useful approach to address system complexity by, for example, conceptualizing social-ecological interactions, identifying interactions across scales, and assessing system dynamics. Strategies related to understanding the adaptive and emergent features of complex systems were less developed and widespread. The study also revealed a set of strategies to address process complexity, such as facilitating dialogue, building networks, and designing a flexible and iterative process, showing how complexity can be embedded into the resilience assessment process. The more participatory and embedded cases of resilience practice were stronger in these process-oriented strategies. The complexity framework we used and the identified practical strategies provide a theoretically-grounded resource for managers, decision-makers, and researchers on how to engage with complexity when applying resilience in a variety of contexts, including development and landscape management.},

title={``Like the plains people losing the buffalo{''}: perceptions of climate change impacts, fisheries management, and adaptation actions by Indigenous peoples in coastal British Columbia, Canada},

abstract={Rapidly developing and complex climate change impacts have profound implications for coastal communities, demanding adaptation actions for both social and ecological systems. Along the coast of British Columbia, Canada, Indigenous peoples developed a tightly coupled social-ecological system that was interrupted by the arrival of settler colonialism in the 1800s. Although both climate change adaptation and the impacts of colonization have been well studied, little research has examined how these themes interact, and the conditions that may support or prevent people's ability to adapt to the social-ecological changes that emerge. Through a collaborative partnership with four First Nations and their umbrella organization for technical support, we examined people's perceptions of social and ecological aspects of adaptation to climate change. Using semistructured interviews (n = 50), four key strategies emerged as critical for climate change adaptation: (1) strengthening Indigenous governance autonomy and authority, (2) promoting knowledge sharing for adaptation practices within and among communities, (3) promoting adaptive comanagement among governance scales, and (4) developing learning platforms for climate impacts and adaptive strategies. Actions typically proposed by non-Indigenous government, including marine protected areas and ecosystem-based management were not prioritized. We found diverse attitudes toward climate change impacts, indicating that people's perceptions of adaptation strategies are strongly influenced by exposure to observable impacts, the social-ecological context in which they live, and perceptions of governance and self-determination. Our study suggests that supporting Indigenous peoples' ability to adapt to climate change will require transforming the current governance model into one that acknowledges Indigenous social, cultural, and food needs and how these relate to marine resources and territorial management rights.},

month={JUN},
abstract={The systematic dwindling over time of many commercially important fish stocks in developed countries and the increasing demand of international markets provided a window of opportunity for fishery sector development in many developing countries. Science-based assessments of how market forces impact on fisheries trends are particularly limited in developing countries. This study assessed long-term trends (1960-2013) of the Uruguayan industrial fishery sector, including: (i) landings discriminated by species and resource type; (ii) variations in nominal effort and fleet capacity; (iii) bioeconomic patterns for most important species; and (iv) export and import volumes at the Uruguayan seafood market. Results indicate the sector underwent four phases that depict long-term patterns: development, expansion, stabilization-diversification and declining yields and market contraction. The development of the sector was mainly due to the Argentine hake fishery, which was characterized by a sustained increase in landings, nominal effort and fleet capacity during the initial decades, but showed a decreasing trend afterwards. In response, a fishery diversification policy based on more valuable target species but with lower trophic levels was developed. Uruguay adopted a seafood net exporter role since the very beginning, with exports increasing linearly through time. More recently, seafood imports, with more competitive prices than locally caught seafood, have been gaining ground in the domestic market, reaching a third of all seafood currently consumed. Nowadays, the Uruguayan fishery sector is facing a crisis that is clearly reflected in the decreasing yields of the main species targeted, exports dwindling and increasing seafood imports. These results highlight the pressing need of the industrial sector to shift its model of fisheries exploitation. This study also provides evidence of the need to consider additional bioeconomic analysis to fully understand the behavior of the fishery sector as a dynamic social-ecological system operating in a globalized seafood trade scenario.

journal={PACIFIC SCIENCE},
year={2020},
volume={74},
number={2},
pages={115-135},
month={APR},
abstract={Most tropical islands have limited water supply due to the small size of their watersheds and aquifers, unique geology, and distribution of rainfall; each affecting the reliability of water resources for meeting agricultural needs. To improve water supply, reservoirs provide critical storage of surface water. However, climate-driven shifts in the distribution, intensity, and amount of rainfall will alter runoff that feeds reservoirs. Mass-balance modeling was used to evaluate the effects of various management constraints on water availability for the Wahiawa Reservoir (O'ahu, Hawai'i) as well as the impact of 20\% less dry season rainfall and stream flow to assess the effect of projected climate change on maintaining: (1) a minimum downstream flow; (2) a minimum agricultural supply; (3) a minimum and maximum reservoir level; and (4) a combination of minimum downstream flow and minimum agricultural supply. Under current climate conditions, maintaining a minimal downstream water release could be met with minimal consequences for agricultural supply and reservoir level. However, both agricultural supply and downstream flow had to be reduced during dry periods to keep the reservoir level above a minimum level. Maintaining a minimum downstream flow resulted in a 4.2\% reduction in mean agricultural supply and 2.2 \% reduction in mean reservoir elevation compared to baseline conditions. By contrast, a 20\% reduction in dry season water inputs resulted in a 17.8\% reduction in mean agricultural supply in the minimum downstream flow scenario compared to current rainfall conditions. Furthermore, the number of days the reservoir level dropped below the minimum needed for a fishery increased (range 1.15-25x) across scenarios compared to baseline. Successful management of surface water within a social-ecological system will be challenged by the increasing unpredictability of rainfall.},

volume={17},
number={1},
pages={NA},
month={NA},
abstract={Many current water planning and management problems are riddled with high levels of complexity, uncertainty, and conflict, so-called ``messes{''} or ``wicked problems.{''} The realization that there is a need to consider a wide variety of values, knowledge, and perspectives in a collaborative decision making process has led to a multitude of new methods and processes being proposed to aid water planning and management, which include participatory forms of modeling, planning, and decision aiding processes. However, despite extensive scientific discussions, scholars have largely been unable to provide satisfactory responses to two pivotal questions: (1) What are the benefits of using participatory approaches?; (2) How exactly should these approaches be implemented in complex social-ecological settings to realize these potential benefits? In the study of developing social-ecological system sustainability, the first two questions lead to a third one that extends beyond the one-time application of participatory approaches for water management: (3) How can participatory approaches be most appropriately used to encourage transition to more sustainable ecological, social, and political regimes in different cultural and spatial contexts? The answer to this question is equally open. This special feature on participatory water management attempts to propose responses to these three questions by outlining recent advances in theory, practice, and evaluation related to the implementation of participatory water management. The feature is largely based on an extensive range of case studies that have been implemented and analyzed by cross-disciplinary research teams in collaboration with practitioners, and in a number of cases in close cooperation with policy makers and other interested parties such as farmers, fishermen, environmentalists, and the wider public.},

title={Social-ecological traps link food systems to nutritional outcomes},
journal={GLOBAL FOOD SECURITY-AGRICULTURE POLICY ECONOMICS AND ENVIRONMENT},
year={2021},
volume={30},

pages={NA},
month={SEP},
abstract={Recognized as an emerging global crisis in the mid-1990s, the ``nutrition transition{''} is marked by a shift to Western diets, dominated by highly processed, sugar-sweetened, and high caloric foods. Occurring in parallel to these health transitions are dramatic shifts in the natural systems that underlie food availability and access. Traditionally, environmental degradation and ecosystem change, and processes of nutritional transition, though often collinear and potentially causally linked, have been addressed in isolation. Food systems represent an emblematic social-ecological system, as both cultivated and wild foods are directly reliant on natural ecosystems and their processes. While healthy ecosystems are a necessary precondition of food production, they are not themselves sufficient to ensure continued benefits from local food systems. Mediating between food production and nutritional security are myriad governance and market institutions that shape differential access to food resources. Moreover, globalization and urbanization may shift communities from non-market to market-based economies, with profound implications for local environments and food systems. Specifically, we argue that it is this feedback between coupled socioeconomic and natural dynamics within food systems that reinforces specific nutritional outcomes, and may result in a social-ecological trap. Here, we use the case of reef-based food systems globally, paying particular attention to the Pacific to showcase social-ecological traps present in global food systems, and to illustrate how such traps lead to the acceleration of the nutrition transition. Improving both nutritional and environmental outcomes of food systems requires understanding the underlying drivers of each, and how they interact and reinforce each other. Only in recognizing these interactions and coupled dynamics will economic, governance, and environmental policies be positioned to address these food system challenges in an integrated fashion.},

abstract={Accurate estimation of the levels of non-compliance to fishing regulations is crucial in ensuring that long term sustainability goals of fisheries are met. When requesting information regarding sensitive behaviour, such as an anglers non-compliance to regulations through direct questioning methods (DQM), their responses can be influenced by social desirability bias (SDB). Literature in human dimensions research on methods for controlling this bias is limited. There has been an emerging prevalence in the use of the random response technique (RRT), which is a method aimed at reducing SDB in questions regarding sensitive behaviour, although it has never been validated against observed data in an environmental resource use context. An alternative to the RRT, the use of a ballot box method (BBM) has been successfully implemented to reduce SDB in contingent valuation studies and is introduced in this paper as a method for reducing SDB in face-to-face survey responses regarding sensitive behaviour. The RRT, BBM and a baseline DQM were compared for accuracy in obtaining honest responses from non-compliant anglers in South Africas recreational marine based shore fishery (MBSF) who were covertly observed violating various regulations. A total of 79.6\% of anglers who were interviewed using the BBM admitted to breaking the observed regulation. However, only 46.5\% and 38.5\% of the anglers who were interviewed using the DQM and RRT admitted to breaking the regulations. The length of the angler interview using the RRT was also significantly longer than the BBM and DQM. These results suggest that the BBM is the most accurate and practical method for reducing SDB in compliance surveys.},

year={2016},
volume={21},

pages={NA},
month={NA},
abstract={Indigenous communities have actively managed their environments for millennia using a diversity of resource use and conservation strategies. Clam gardens, ancient rock-walled intertidal beach terraces, represent one example of an early mariculture technology that may have been used to improve food security and confer resilience to coupled human-ocean systems. We surveyed a coastal landscape for evidence of past resource use and management to gain insight into ancient resource stewardship practices on the central coast of British Columbia, Canada. We found that clam gardens are embedded within a diverse portfolio of resource use and management strategies and were likely one component of a larger, complex resource management system. We compared clam diversity, density, recruitment, and biomass in three clam gardens and three unmodified nonwalled beaches. Evidence suggests that butter clams (Saxidomus gigantea) had 1.96 times the biomass and 2.44 times the density in clam gardens relative to unmodified beaches. This was due to a reduction in beach slope and thus an increase in the optimal tidal range where clams grow and survive best. The most pronounced differences in butter clam density between nonwalled beaches and clam gardens were found at high tidal elevations at the top of the beach. Finally, clam recruits (0.5-2 mm in length) tended to be greater in clam gardens compared to nonwalled beaches and may be attributed to the addition of shell hash by ancient people, which remains on the landscape today. As part of a broader social-ecological system, clam garden sites were among several modifications made by humans that collectively may have conferred resilience to past communities by providing reliable and diverse access to food resources.},

abstract={Seagrasses help mitigate climate change by capturing and storing carbon for a very long time. Despite their significance, multiple threats are putting pressure on this valuable habitat. Seagrass conservation and restoration is essential to maintain the carbon sequestration service, along with the other ecosystem services (e.g., fisheries production). Information on the status of seagrass habitat is required to enable proactive management strategies. In this study, we assessed the ecological status of seagrass meadows in Indonesia, a globally significant hotspot of blue carbon habitat, using five resilience parameters: seagrass species richness, seagrass cover, macroalgal cover, epiphyte cover, and water transparency. We collected data on these parameters from 18 locations across Indonesia and developed the Seagrass Ecological Quality Index (SEQI, range 0-1) that summarises the parameters into a standard seagrass assessment. We recorded that Thalassia hemprichii and Enhalus acoroides were the most common species in the sampling locations. Seagrass cover was on average 39 +/- 3.6\% (mean +/- SE) which was lower than measured 3 years before (46\%). Macroalgal cover and epiphyte cover were relatively low with mean values 10 +/- 1.8\% and 22 +/- 4.4\% respectively. Most locations had clear water. Our analysis showed that Indonesia's seagrass meadows are generally in moderate condition, indicated by the mean value of SEQI 0.68 +/- 0.02. These findings provide a baseline for seagrass conservation and management. It enables setting up of specific goals for management action plans, at both the local, national and international level, and where appropriate, track the progress of management actions based on threat mitigation or restoration over time. The SEQI is a useful tool to summarise the condition of tropical seagrass meadows in Indonesia and could be applied across Southeast Asia or the Tropical Indo-Pacific bioregion.

abstract={Brazil has a network of marine extractive reserves (RESEX), a form of marine protected area (MPA) using comanagement. The RESEX program aims to bring traditionally marginalized populations with natural resource dependent livelihoods into national development processes by empowering them to participate in governance and steward biodiversity conservation. We apply the social-ecological systems framework (SESF) and collective action theory to diagnose challenges for comanagement in the Caete-Teperacu marine RESEX near Braganca, Brazil, a multiuse mangrove estuary supporting a small-scale crab fishery. We conducted key informant interviews and build on over 20 years of research in the region to provide an overarching analysis of the challenges facing comanagement. We describe the variables from the SESF in the case context and find that many social and ecological variables interact in clusters over time, and these clusters can be identified as themes, including (1) social and political momentum supporting the RESEX; (2) shifting perceptions of local residents and fishers; (3) patron-client relationships and social-ecological traps; (4) challenges with institutional fit; and (5) the interactions between harvesting closures, compensation, and dependence on local natural resources. Furthermore, we use collective action theory to help explain the role that each variable plays in either hindering or enabling successful governance. Our findings suggest that institutional resilience is needed to make RESEX adaptive to shifting social and political momenta. It could do this by providing more platforms for communication, deliberation, and knowledge exchange among the relevant actors. We believe our findings reflect broader challenges facing RESEX implementation throughout Brazil, and lessons can be learned for MPAs facing difficulties with the implementation of comanagement worldwide.},

volume={143},

pages={NA},
month={SEP},
abstract={Recreational fishing is an important component of the global capture fishery, given its significant role in the economy, social culture, and ecology. Compared to the mature development found in industrialized countries, recreational fishing in developing countries or transitional economy is a new industry with abundant jobs and high revenues. China's recreational fishery industry has shown an upward trend since 2003. This paper built an evaluation framework from both static (present competitive strength) and dynamic (potential competitive strength) perspectives to evaluate recreational fishery competitiveness in 30 Chinese provinces based on normal cloud model. The results showed the following: (1) The evaluation framework can effectively evaluate recreational fishery competitiveness. Meanwhile, there is significant randomness and fuzziness discrepancy between different indicators. `Industry' indicators had the lowest fuzziness and randomness. (2) The development of recreational fishery competitiveness in China is not strong and uneven, with more than two-thirds of the total provinces with the lowest competitiveness level. Regarding spatial distribution, the eastern coastal provinces had relatively strong competitiveness, whereas the western inland provinces were weak. (3) There was stability divergence of competitiveness results among different grades. In general, the competitiveness of provinces belonging to grades I and V was the most stable, while other provinces are relatively unstable with the characteristics of dynamic changes. (4) The main advantageous factors for recreational fishery competitiveness in most provinces were `service', whereas the main disadvantageous factor was `resources'. The abundance of fishery resources might not be a key factor resulting in regional recreational fishery competitiveness discrepancies. This study can provide a reference for decision-makers to formulate an assessment framework for recreational fishery industry and provide ideas for the formulation of recreational fishery planning at the national level.},

title={The Regime Shifts Database: a framework for analyzing regime shifts in social-ecological systems},
journal={ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
year={2018},
volume={23},
number={3},
pages={NA},
month={NA},
abstract={Regime shifts, i.e., large, persistent, and usually unexpected changes in ecosystems and social-ecological systems, can have major impacts on ecosystem services, and consequently, on human well-being. However, the vulnerability of different regions to various regime shifts is largely unknown because evidence for the existence of regime shifts in different ecosystems and parts of the world is scattered and highly uneven. Furthermore, research tends to focus on individual regime shifts rather than comparisons across regime shifts, limiting the potential for identifying common drivers that could reduce the risk of multiple regime shifts simultaneously. Here, we introduce the Regime Shifts Database, an open-access database that systematically synthesizes information on social-ecological regime shifts across a wide range of systems using a consistent, comparative framework, providing a wide-ranging information resource for environmental planning, assessment, research, and teaching initiatives. The database currently contains 28 generic types of regime shifts and > 300 specific case studies. Each entry provides a literature-based synthesis of the key drivers and feedbacks underlying the regime shift, as well as impacts on ecosystem services and human well-being, and possible management options. Across the 28 regime shifts, climate change and agriculture-related activities are the most prominent among a wide range of drivers. Biodiversity, fisheries, and aquatic ecosystems are particularly widely affected, as are key aspects of human well-being, including livelihoods, food and nutrition, and an array of cultural ecosystem services. We hope that the database will stimulate further research and teaching on regime shifts that can inform policy and practice and ultimately enhance our collective ability to manage and govern large, abrupt, systemic changes in the Anthropocene.},

title={Applying a social-ecological well-being approach to enhance opportunities for marine protected area governance},
journal={ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},

volume={24},

pages={NA},
month={SEP},
abstract={The design and implementation of ecologically effective marine protected areas (MPAs) are influenced by social acceptance and the impact of MPAs on communities. Integrative analyses of the social and ecological determinants of marine conservation efforts and MPA networks are lacking but are needed to achieve desired outcomes. We developed and applied a ``social-ecological well-being{''} (SEWB) approach to critically examine the linkages between MPAs and well-being in Southwest New Brunswick (Bay of Fundy, Canada). SEWB is defined as a social-ecological system state in which ecological resilience is sustained, while human needs are met and the quality of life of individuals is maintained. We examined (1) how stakeholders perceive benefits and costs of MPAs in relation to SEWB, and (2) how well-being insights contribute to the effectiveness of MPA governance. Using a qualitative case study approach, we conducted 49 semistructured interviews and 4 focus groups with fishers and other key informants at an existing MPA, as well as at an ecologically and biologically significant area that is a candidate for a future MPA. We identified 15 attributes of SEWB that related to MPAs, such as fishery access, community relations, place identity, and natural capital. Three key governance insights for decision makers emerged from the identification of these attributes: (1) displacement attributable to MPAs has implications across material, relational, subjective, and ecological dimensions; (2) effective collaboration is critical for community support, but perspectives about what constitutes effective collaboration may vary across stakeholder groups; and (3) aspects of MPA design fit poorly with the local context because they do not take social and ecological dynamics into account. Our findings empirically demonstrate the applicability of the SEWB framework, suggest a need to focus more on governance processes and improving fit, and highlight barriers to aligning national and local conservation priorities.},

title={Understanding the dynamics of fish politics: The role of diverse actor interactions in transformations towards co-management},
journal={ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},
year={2021},
volume={124},
number={NA},
pages={195-205},
month={OCT},
abstract={Co-management is often put forward as a way to foster sustainability and improve the adaptive capacity of smallscale fisheries. Transformations towards co-management are enabled by processes that support social change, such as nurturing leadership, collective action and learning, as well as political processes that change legislative frameworks from centralized to decentralized decision-making. However, major policy changes can be difficult and change-actors often fail to overcome barriers created by institutional friction, dominant policy discourses or powerful interests supporting the status quo. In the literature, special attention has been paid to social processes that foster cooperation, the role of bridging-actors on the path towards co-management, or conditions that influence its effective implementation. In this paper we shift the attention to political decision-making and changes in policy discourse as an integral part of fisheries' transformations. We use the well-studied cases of comanagement transformations in small-scale fisheries to identify how interactions among political actors and stakeholders, as well as social-ecological interactions, shaped the policy discourse and influenced policy change during the transformation process. By comparing how policy change emerged across four fishery transformation cases, we illustrate the importance of (cross-scale and cross-type) coordination and collaboration among diverse political actors in creating conditions for adoption of legislation, as well as its timing during the policy process. The paper contributes to the literature on sustainability transformations by explaining how policy changes supporting such transformations may emerge, in addition to providing insight on political conditions and processes that could be fostered in order to support policy change towards decentralization in fisheries.},

journal={ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
year={2022},
volume={27},
number={1},
pages={NA},
month={MAR},
abstract={Worldwide climate change will influence the spatial distribution and status of exploited fish stocks, often in uncertain ways with cascading effects on the social-ecological systems depending on them. Likewise, changes in sociopolitical conditions influencing consumer demand, fuel, and fish prices may jeopardize the viability of fisheries. Predicting whether existing management systems can adapt to these changes is key and especially challenging in data-poor fisheries. In the Mediterranean Sea, the tropical and subtropical dolphinfish (Coryphaena hippurus) is at its northernmost reproductive distribution area and has sustained a seasonal age-0 based artisanal small-scale fishery since ancient times. We built a quantitative Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) model integrating a diverse set of ecological, social, and economic input data to assess the impact of plausible midterm futures (2040-2059) on the seasonal economic profit for dolphinfish fishers in Mallorca (Balearic Islands, Western Mediterranean). These future scenarios accounted for increasing sea surface temperature based on global IPCC projections, population dynamics and growth of dolphinfish, economic forecasts of future fish and fuel prices, and stakeholders' views on feasible adaptations of the local management system. Seven out of twelve scenarios point towards increased profitability for fishers. To date, the fishery is managed locally although within a wider EU regulatory framework, and options such as advancing the opening date of the fishing season in response to climate-induced changes in growth and body size of dolphinfish might be economically beneficial. This will, however, depend critically on the evolution of unknown factors such as changes in other target species, consumption habits of people, and market dynamics. We show here that, even in fisheries without information on stock status, an integrated and holistic assessment of adaptive capacities of management systems is possible.},

year={2020},
volume={63},
number={NA},
pages={NA},
month={JUL},
abstract={Faced with accelerating environmental challenges, research on social-ecological systems is increasingly focused on the need for transformative change towards sustainable stewardship of natural resources. This paper analyses the potential of rapid, large-scale socio-political change as a window of opportunity for transformative change of natural resources governance. We hypothesize that shocks at higher levels of social organization may open up opportunities for transformation of social-ecological systems into new pathways of development. However, opportunities need to be carefully navigated otherwise transformations may stall or lead the social-ecological system in undesirable directions. We investigate (i) under which circumstances socio-political change has been used by actors as a window of opportunity for initiating transformation towards sustainable natural resource governance, (ii) how the different levels of the systems (landscape, regime and niche) interact to pave the way for initiating such transformations and (iii) which key features (cognitive, structural and agency-related) get mobilized for transformation. This is achieved through analyzing natural resource governance regimes of countries that have been subject to rapid, large-scale political change: water governance in South Africa and Uzbekistan and governance of coastal fisheries in Chile. In South Africa the political and economic change of the end of the apartheid regime resulted in a transformation of the water governance regime while in Uzbekistan after the breakdown of the Soviet Union change both at the economic and political scales and within the water governance regime remained superficial. In Chile the democratization process after the Pinochet era was used to transform the governance of coastal fisheries. The paper concludes with important insight on key capacities needed to navigate transformation towards biosphere stewardship. The study also contributes to a more nuanced view on the relationship between collapse and renewal.},

year={2017},
volume={22},

pages={NA},
month={NA},
abstract={Managing for sustainable development and resource extraction requires an understanding of the feedbacks between ecosystems and humans. These feedbacks are part of complex social-ecological systems (SES), in which resources, actors, and governance systems interact to produce outcomes across these component parts. Qualitative modeling approaches offer ways to assess complex SES dynamics. Loop analysis in particular is useful for examining and identifying potential outcomes from external perturbations and management interventions in data poor systems when very little is known about functional relationships and parameter values. Using a case study of multispecies, multifleet coastal small-scale fisheries, we demonstrate the application of loop analysis to provide predictions regarding SES responses to perturbations and management actions. Specifically, we examine the potential ecological and socioeconomic consequences to coastal fisheries of different governance interventions (e.g., territorial user rights, fisheries closures, market-based incentives, ecotourism subsidies) and environmental changes. Our results indicate that complex feedbacks among biophysical and socioeconomic components can result in counterintuitive and unexpected outcomes. For example, creating new jobs through ecotourism or subsidies might have mixed effects on members of fishing cooperatives vs. nonmembers, highlighting equity issues. Market-based interventions, such as ecolabels, are expected to have overall positive economic effects, assuming a direct effect of ecolabels on marketprices, and a lack of negative biological impacts under most model structures. Our results highlight that integrating ecological and social variables in a unique unit of management can reveal important potential trade-offs between desirable ecological and social outcomes, highlight which user groups might be more vulnerable to external shocks, and identify which interventions should be further tested to identify potential win-win outcomes across the triple-bottom line of the sustainable development paradigm.},

abstract={Coastal marine resources provide livelihoods to human communities around the world. The interactions in respective social-ecological systems are usually of complex nature, due to a wide range of different fisheries interacting with the ecosystem. Understanding connectivity within these systems (i.e. among social and ecological actors) helps in establishing meaningful management strategies for sustainable use of marine resources. This work uses the value chain analysis of different fisheries sectors to construct a qualitative social-ecological network (SEN) model of the Sechura Bay in North Peru. Here, a diverse ensemble of small-scale fisheries coexists with a flourishing mariculture sector, though the respective production chains partially overlap. Directed and unweighted links between actors were defined based on the transfer of biomass (trophic interactions) and money (economic interactions). Several analytical network tools were applied (e.g. degree centrality, dominator tree) to identify the most important nodes of the social-ecological network and to understand interdependencies. Results of the network analysis suggest position of system's components being related to their vulnerability in the face of external disturbances. Fisher groups with a high specialization with respect to fisheries target species were stronger impacted by the last strong El Nifio event (the Coastal El Nifio 2017), with drastic consequences for actors of the respective production chains. The present approach is envisioned to be applicable beyond this particular case study and to nourish on-going scientific discussions on the use of social-ecological network analysis to describe human-nature interactions. This study allows (i) estimating node (actor) susceptibilities to natural and anthropogenic disturbances, and (ii) reconciling sustainable resource use and nature conservation by enhancing the understanding of the functionality of the respective social-ecological system.},

year={2016},
volume={3},
number={NA},
pages={NA},
month={NA},
abstract={Coral reef fisheries support the development of local and national economies and are the basis of important cultural practices and worldviews. Transitioning economies, human development, and environmental stress can harm this livelihood. Here we focus on a transitioning social-ecological system as a case study (Moorea, French Polynesia). We review fishing practices and three decades of effort and landing estimates with the broader goal of informing management. Fishery activities in Moorea are quite challenging to quantify because of the diversity of gears used, the lack of centralized access points or markets, the high participation rates of the population in the fishery, and the overlapping cultural and economic motivations to catch fish. Compounding this challenging diversity, we lack a basic understanding of the complex interplay between the cultural, subsistence, and commercial use of Moorea's reefs. In Moorea, we found an order of magnitude gap between estimates of fishery yield produced by catch monitoring methods (similar to 2 t km(-2) year(-1)) and estimates produced using consumption or participatory socioeconomic consumer surveys (similar to 24 t km(-2) year(-1)), Several lines of evidence suggest reef resources may be overexploited and stakeholders have a diversity of opinions as to whether trends in the stocks are a cause for concern. The reefs, however, remain ecologically resilient. The relative health of the reef is striking given the socio-economic context. Moorea has a relatively high population density, a modern economic system linked into global flows of trade and travel, and the fishery has little remaining traditional or customary management. Other islands in the Pacific in similar contexts in Polynesia such as Hawaii, that continue to develop economically, may have small-scale fisheries that increasingly resemble Moorea. Therefore, understanding Moorea's reef fisheries may provide insight into their future.},

month={FEB},
abstract={Integrated Coastal Management cannot operate effectively without reliable information and knowledge on changes in the environment and on the causes of those changes. Monitoring is essential to provide data needed for a real understanding of socio-economic and ecological functioning in multi-user nature areas. We present a web-based and comprehensive assessment methodology to articulate, structure and prioritize information needs and ensuing monitoring needs. We applied this methodology in the Dutch Wadden Sea Region, which includes a designated UNESCO World Heritage nature reserve. The methodology consists of the following steps: i) exploring social-ecological issues of concern and defining the monitoring scope; ii) articulating information needs expressed as tractable questions; iii) elaborating monitoring needs; iv) grounding in scientific models and current monitoring; v) synthesizing assessment findings into target entities, i.e. analysis variables for monitoring. In this paper we focus on the first three steps. As part of our methodology we performed two online surveys amongst a broad range of stakeholders and amongst monitoring professionals. In the case of the Dutch Wadden Sea Region, main monitoring questions were related to biodiversity and food web relations; effects of fisheries and its pressures on the ecosystem; channel and port dredging; spatial planning and multifunctional use; sustainable energy production; and effects of changing storm regimes due to climate change. Subsequently we elaborated these general issues into analysis variables within five themes. The presented methodology enables large scale and unbiased involvement of stakeholders in articulating information needs in a multi-user nature reserve like the Wadden Sea. In addition the methodology facilitates the input and feedback of monitoring professionals by providing a detailed elaboration of monitoring needs. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The social-ecological system framework (SESF) can be useful for applied research and management practice beyond its traditional academic applications. In this article we transform the SESF into an image-based practical tool to facilitate knowledge exchange and deliberation processes within community-based natural resource comanagement settings. We develop a transdisciplinary methodology to transform the SESF into simple and context relevant images that are understandable by nonspecialists, yet the image-based framework still conveys its core tenets of systems thinking, a checklist for system complexity and conceptualizing social-ecological interactions. We then demonstrate a mixed-method approach for testing the usefulness of the image-based framework for enhancing communication, knowledge exchange, and deliberation processes. We show how the academic uses of the SESF, its core tenets, can serve the same purpose for nonacademic actors. When transformed, the image-based SESF has potential to be a tool that can enhance communication and knowledge exchange between actors in governance settings. We demonstrate our methodology with small-scale fishers involved with comanagement in the Gulf of Nicoya, Costa Rica. In the example, we show how scientists must learn from fishers, to understand how they view their system, in order to make the image-based tool useful in context. We then test its usefulness by exploring the hypothesis that the image-based framework can help fishers discuss with more depth and complexity because it provides a simple conceptual base for systems thinking and a core set of variables to consider as interacting. Furthermore, we explore how using the framework during deliberation may be able to alter the social-psychological outcomes of participants using field experimental methods. We discuss our combined methodology, for transforming the framework and measuring deliberation impacts, while reflecting on new ways of thinking about how the SESF can be useful for applied research and practice.},

journal={ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
year={2023},
volume={28},
number={3},
pages={NA},
month={AUG},
abstract={Human-driven nutrient inputs into aquatic ecosystems must be managed to preserve biodiversity and to ensure that valued fishery and water quality services are not compromised by hypoxia and harmful algal blooms. Aiming for nutrient inputs that achieve an intermediate level of ecosystem productivity is expected to provide both high fish yield and good water quality. However, we argue that such an intermediate ``optimum{''} may not exist for many aquatic ecosystems that support multiple fisheries with differing tolerances to eutrophication and that must provide multiple water quality services. We further support this argument with an empirical case study of nearly a century (1915-2011) of change in the productivity of Lake Erie and its lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis), walleye (Sander vitreus), and yellow perch (Perca flavescens) fisheries. We discuss and show how the harvest of each fishery has been historically maximized at different levels of ecosystem productivity. Additionally, we examine how anticipated management efforts to improve water quality by reducing nutrient inputs (i.e., oligotrophication) may favor certain fisheries over others, resulting in no single optimal range of nutrient inputs that achieves all valued fishery and water quality objectives. Our synthesis and case study illustrate how the need to balance multiple services in aquatic ecosystems can create a wicked management problem with inevitable trade-offs. To navigate these trade-offs, we recommend the use of ecosystem-based management approaches, which can help decision makers identify and resolve complex trade-offs by facilitating cooperative research and communication among water quality regulators, fisheries managers, and end users.},

title={Participatory modelling for conceptualizing social-ecological system dynamics in the Bangladesh delta},
journal={REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE},
year={2020},
volume={20},

pages={NA},
month={FEB 19},
abstract={The concept of complex social-ecological systems (SES) as a means for capturing system dynamics properties (e.g. interactions and feedbacks) has gained attention in policymaking and advancing evidence in understanding complex systems. In contexts with limited data, conceptual system dynamic models offer a promising entry point to overcome challenges in understanding SES dynamics, which is essential for managing the long-term sustainability of SES and human wellbeing. Here, we build on previous work focused on agricultural production and use participatory approaches to develop a conceptual System Dynamics (SD) model for the south-west coastal SES in Bangladesh encompassing multiple forms of livelihood (fisheries, shrimp farming and forests, as well as agriculture). Using qualitative methods, including focus group discussions with farmers, fishermen, shrimp farmers and forest people, as well as expert consultations, we identified interactions, feedback loops and thresholds for the SES. The conceptual system model developed independently by stakeholders is consistent with a model developed using an empirical approach and literature review. Feedback loops are identified for the ecological (e.g. climate and water, mangrove and salinity) and social (e.g. shrimp farming and mangrove, agricultural (e.g. crops) production and subsidy) sub-systems in the Bangladesh delta. The biophysical thresholds that impact social conditions include river water discharge (1500 to 2000 m(3) s(-1)), climate (28 degrees C) and soil salinity (similar to 4 to similar to 10 dS m(-1)). Exceeding these thresholds suggests that SES may lose resilience in the near future and increase the likelihood of regime shifts. Findings of this study contribute to the management of the deltaic ecosystem and provide specific policy recommendations for improving environmental sustainability and human well-being in the Bangladesh delta and can be further used as inputs into system dynamic modelling to simulate changes in this SES.},

abstract={1. Social- ecological system sustainability depends in part upon the fit between ecosystems and institutions. 2. In 2014, the local community on Easter Island started a bottom- up process to improve marine resources conservation and management. 3. Local stakeholders formed a working group that has regular meetings and goals, such as creating a sea council and some basic action plans, thus initiating a local governance transformation process. 4. A participatory process was conducted together with a local organization that led the marine conservation issues on the island to define the factors that could favour and/ or undermine the formation of the sea council. Also, the stakeholders that must be present in such a sea council were identified. 5. Twelve factors that could facilitate or hinder the implementation of a sea council were identified. The lack of representativeness of public institutions is a major challenge. 6. Public institutions are designed to ensure compliance with central government strategies, but the decisions do not represent the worldview of islanders. 7. The results showed the potential value of conducting a participatory process to identify the key issues that could hinder or favour a desired governance transformation process. The participatory process also highlighted governance mismatches that are important to consider in attempts to pursue more effective fishery governance on Easter Island, and other Island communities. 8. Centralized governance systems do not respond rapidly to locally observed social and ecological dynamics. By contrast, a local decision- making system based on traditional laws and local governance can more rapidly respond to observed changes. 9. The participatory process presented here holds the potential to support local people in their planning and coordination for marine conservation and management in order to optimize bottom- up change processes involving multiple stakeholders with different interests, values and levels of power.

year={2023},
volume={265},

month={SEP},
abstract={A major challenge in natural resource management in developing countries is to pursue conservation objectives while avoiding negative impacts on local livelihoods. Inland capture fisheries provide opportunities to demon-strate an integration of conservation and livelihood objectives when managed as a social-ecological system. While numerous marine no-take reserves have been found effective for the recovery of fisheries, few well-documented examples exist in the freshwater realm. Research gaps also remain in the role of co-management in balancing various management objectives and resolving conflicts. This paper offers critical reflection on adaptive co-management of fish conservation zones (FCZs) in the Mekong River in Cambodia and its social-ecological outcomes as perceived by local stakeholders. The management approach was found generally effec-tive for the local stakeholders to negotiate between conservation and livelihood objectives at key stages of the implementation, and resolve conflicts; however, the lessons learned were not uniform across all sites. The degree of difficulty in conflict resolution was mainly a function of the fishing dependency of local communities on the protected site, the prevalence of severe poverty in adjacent villages, and the availability of livelihood options other than fishing. Growing stakeholder perception over time, of the FCZs as yielding positive outcomes-for both conservation and livelihood-motivated the local communities to create more FCZs. We argue clear recognition by local stakeholders of the achievements and the fairness in the FCZ management, facilitated through participatory approaches, can improve their acceptance of conservation rules and enhance their effec-tiveness. However, long-term mechanisms to support these community initiatives technically and financially are needed. Simple yet scientifically robust approaches for tropical freshwater fisheries monitoring, including pe-riodical assessments of indicator species, are also needed to facilitate performance evaluation of specific man-agement measures locally.},

title={Social-Cultural Ecosystem Services of Sea Trout Recreational Fishing in Norway},
journal={FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
year={2019},
volume={6},
number={NA},
pages={NA},
month={APR 24},
abstract={This paper explores the ecosystem services provided by anadromous brown trout (often termed sea trout) populations in Norway. Sea trout is an important species in both freshwater and marine ecosystems and provides important demand-driven ecological provisioning and socio-cultural services. While the sea trout once provided an important provisioning service through a professional fishery and subsistence fishing, fishing for sea trout in the near shore coastal areas and in rivers is today a very popular and accessible recreational activity and generates primarily socio-cultural services. The recreational fishery contributes to local cultural heritage, its folkways and lore, to the development and transfer of local ecological knowledge and fishing experience to the young and to human well-being. As a salmonid species, the sea trout is sensitive to negative environmental conditions in both freshwater and marine coastal areas and is in general decline. A recent decision to expand production of farmed salmon may increase pressure on stocks. Good management of recreational fishing is accordingly important for the species to thrive, but knowledge of what fishers value with respect to fishing sea trout and what management measures they will accept is limited. Researchers sought to capture information about non-extractive direct use value (non-monetary) of the sea trout recreational fishery using questionnaire surveys targeting Norwegian anglers around the country. Results indicate that the most important ecosystem services delivered by recreational sea trout fisheries are social-cultural ecosystem services at the level of individual fishers; fishing sea trout most likely also has important social functions. Fishers are prepared to accept stricter management measures that reduce catches and allow fishing to continue but they oppose paying higher fees.},

journal={ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
year={2012},
volume={17},
number={4},
pages={NA},
month={NA},
abstract={In many developing regions of Melanesia, fishers' traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) has been integrated with western science and management knowledge (SMK) to generate innovative and effective fisheries management. Previous research suggests that three factors initiate this process: depleted fishery stocks, limited SMK, and ownership of resources by local communities. In other contexts the extent of power-sharing through comanagement, and the cultural significance of species may also be important determinants of knowledge integration. Here we assess the role of these factors in the application of TEK in the Torres Strait Islands, Australia, where commercial and subsistence fisheries are fundamental to the Indigenous Melanesian culture and livelihoods. In 2009 we surveyed fishery managers and scientists who revealed that TEK had only been recently and sparingly applied in four fisheries (turtle, dugong, lobster, and hand collectables), and only two of the seven species concerned had a combination of depleted stocks, low SMK, and high community ownership. Instead, comanagement characteristics and the cultural value of species were the primary determinants of TEK application. We suggest that turtles and dugong are cultural keystone species that simultaneously provide important ecosystem services to both islanders' livelihoods and international conservation interests. Combined with their ecological scale these species have catalyzed comanagement between indigenous and government stakeholders, precipitating the application of TEK in other fisheries of lesser cultural importance. We discuss modifications to governance required to enable knowledge integration to evolve further through adaptive comanagement, and its role in enhancing fisheries management and thus the resilience of the Torres Strait social-ecological system. Our study highlights the potential utility of cultural keystone species in stimulating cross-cultural resource governance in developed economies such as Australia.},

month={MAY},
abstract={Small-scale fisheries in developing regions are particularly vulnerable to climate change, but the assessment of climate-induced changes and impacts are often hampered by the data poor-situation of these social-ecological systems. Based on 40 years of scientific and local ecological knowledge, we provide a coherent narrative about the effects of a marine hotspot of climate change on a small-scale fishery across different geographical and temporal scales. We applied a mixed-methods approach to assess biophysical changes, social-ecological impacts, and the incremental spectrum of actions implemented at multiple levels to increase the adaptive capacity of a small-scale clam fishery. The warming hotspot here analyzed was the fastest-warming region in the South Atlantic Ocean. Long-term changes in wind intensity and direction were also noticeable at a regional scale. Both sea surface temperature and winds showed a clear shifting pattern in the late 1990 s. These climate-related stressors determined ecosystem and targeted population changes (e.g. clam mass mortalities, slow stock recovery rates after ecological shocks, habitat narrowing), and favored harmful algal bloom-forming organisms. Climate-induced drivers also affected the human component of the social-ecological system, preventing fishers from securing a fulltime livelihood and limiting the fishery economic potential. Adaptive responses at multiple levels provided some capacity to address climate change effects, and transformative pathways are being taken to adapt to climate-induced changes over the long-term. Transformative changes were fostered by the local perception of environmental change, shared narratives, sustained scientific monitoring programs, and the interaction between knowledge systems, facilitated by a bridging organization within a broader process of governance transformation. The combination of autonomous adaptations (based on linking social capital and fishery leaders agency) and government-led adaptations were essential to face the challenges imposed by climate change. Our results serve as a learning platform to anticipate threats and envision solutions to a wide range of small-scale fisheries in fast-warming regions worldwide.},

abstract={Monitoring is an essential component of measuring the performance of protected areas. This requirement led to the development of a biodiversity monitoring system for South African National Parks (SANParks). The system comprises of ten major programmes, each focusing on a core area of conservation biodiversity monitoring, with resource use being one of the focal areas. With the growing appreciation of the importance of natural resources for the socioeconomic well-being of communities and other stakeholders, sustainable resource use is an important component of the management of natural areas and national parks. To gauge sustainability, a sound monitoring and research programme that fits within the context of the SANParks' adaptive management approach towards social-ecological system management is required. The purpose of this article was to define the context and scope in which consumptive resource use takes place within SANParks and to outline the criteria necessary for developing a sound monitoring programme to assess the sustainability of such use. The monitoring programme is structured in view of the fact that sustainable resource use is achievable only where all dimensions of sustainability (social, economic and ecological) are considered simultaneously. In terms of the social and economic dimensions of sustainability, the programme provides for assessing stakeholder needs, trends in resource use and the social and economic impacts of resource use. Monitoring that relates to the ecological dimension of sustainability of biological resource use deals with the rate of turnover and population dynamics of target species, as well as harvest impact. In terms of abiotic (non-renewable) resources, monitoring deals with sound management practices to minimise impact on the environment, and to optimise benefits through responsible use. Conservation implications: The resource use monitoring programme is intended to ensure that monitoring relating to the harvesting of natural resources from national parks is scientifically sound and conducted in a structured way, towards meeting the objective of sustainable use and compliance with national legislation. The article illustrates how SANParks meets its obligation to monitor biodiversity conservation while at the same time meeting the needs for the consumptive use of resources.},

title={Resilience strategies in the face of short- and long-term change: out-migration and fisheries regulation in Alaskan fishing communities},
journal={ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
year={2015},
volume={20},
number={2},
pages={NA},
month={NA},
abstract={Historically, communities persisted in remote, isolated areas of Alaska in large part because of the abundance of marine and terrestrial resources, as well as the ability of local people to opportunistically access those resources as they became available. Species switching and the ability to shift effort away from fisheries during poor years allowed local residents to diversify their livelihoods in the face of uncertainties and ecological change. The advent of modern fisheries management, which views Alaskan fisheries as the property of all citizens of the United States, has fundamentally altered the relationship of place-based communities to fishery resources. Local access to fisheries has been particularly affected by the development of transferable fishing privileges, making it possible for fishing rights to leave place-based communities through the choices of individual community members to sell or to move away. When fishing communities in Alaska lose active fishing businesses, over time the loss of various types of community capital will follow, including human, social, cultural, technical, and financial capital. In some cases, communities are able to adapt or transform through diversification of their local economies. In other cases, no alternatives to a fishery-based economy are accessible. We have used resilience theory to explore drivers of change affecting Alaskan fishing communities. Emphasis was placed on two primary change drivers, the regulatory environment and rural out-migration, as well as their interconnections and their impacts on individuals, communities, and the larger social-ecological system. We summarized several government programs that have been implemented to support the continued participation of communities in Alaskan fisheries. In addition, we reviewed informal and private-sector efforts to generate resilience strategies that can facilitate new entry into fisheries or retain fishing businesses and fishing rights within communities, as well as respond to increasing uncertainty related to the global market and climate changes.},

title={A case study from the southern Cape linefishery 2: Considering one's options when the fish leave},

year={2017},
volume={113},
number={5-6},
pages={65-74},
month={MAY-JUN},
abstract={Fishers in the small-scale, commercial linefishery in the southern Cape, South Africa, are exposed to variability and change in the marine social-ecological system of which they are a part. Faced with multi-scalar changes within this complex system, fishers employ a wide range of strategies in reaction to change. As part of a broader study of stressors that bring about change in these systems, this contribution examines the fishers' responses to these changes and is based on a participant-led, semi-structured interview process of skippers/boat owners, crew, processors and spouses/partners, in six communities in the southern Cape region, and has been supplemented with appropriate secondary data. The results are discussed using a resilience framework. The data were initially considered thematically by stressor, but results identified that a place-based analysis was equally important. Three major groupings were identified: (1) fishers who adapt and show clear business-orientation, (2) fishers who cope, and (3) fishers who react and are thus caught in a poverty trap. In addition to place-specific history, local feedback loops and indirect effects need to be better accounted for to understand these responses to change at various scales. The results of this study are expected to contribute to the basis of scenario planning in the region. Significance: Analysis of responses to change strategies provides insight into resilience displayed as well as costs and benefits of strategies. The description of strategies provides valuable insights into the decision-making processes in linefishery in the southern Cape. Cognitive and reflexive decision-making processes are shaped by individuals' and communities' experiences of past and present. Practical implications of actions are not always the overriding concern in decision-making, which underscores the importance and influence of culture. These results provide important insights into a system that is not well described, and highlight knowledge gaps that require further context-specific research.},

title={Characterization of an artisanal fishery in Argentina using the social-ecological systems framework},
journal={INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE COMMONS},
year={2017},
volume={11},
number={1},
pages={1-69},
month={NA},
abstract={Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) studies how institutions (the rules of the game of a society) determine the performance of a social-economic system. Elinor Ostrom extends the institutional analysis to the collective action for a particular case, the study of the social-ecological systems (SESs) (Ostrom 1990). Any group that attempts to manage a common resource (e.g. aquifers, pastures) for optimal sustainable production must solve a set of problems in order to create institutions to facilitate collective action. Some evidences show that following a set of design principles in creating institutions can lead to overcome these problems. The aim of the paper is to apply the SES framework to an artisanal fishery community in Argentina in order to: 1) describe the principal features, key variables and relations of the small-scale fishery system; 2) detect the principal drivers of a potential common-management and the leading detractors from the current communal performance; and 3) analyze the possibility that a self-governing for sustainable fishery may appear. Several drivers for potential common-management and some detractors from the current common performance are summarized. Artisanal fishery SES is currently at a bifurcation point. A common historical and cultural root, the presence of leaderships, the relevance of local knowledge, the dependence on the resource to sustainable livelihoods and the threat of big-scale fisheries area have generated incentives to collectiveaction. But, simultaneously, internal conflicts are the most important barrier for an integrated community-based management. The heterogeneity among actors and the relevant external conditions have resulted in two groups diverging in their self-organization. The work is framed by the project COMET-LA (COmmunity-based Management of Environmental challenges in Latin America; European Commission's Seventh Framework Programme of Research and Development), which aims to identify sustainable community-based governance for the management of natural resources that can be used in different social-ecological systems in a context of climate change and increasing competition in the use of resources.},

volume={19},
number={3},
pages={NA},
month={NA},
abstract={Oyster reefs provide coastal societies with a vast array of ecosystem services, but are also destructively harvested as an economically and culturally important fishery resource, exemplifying a complex social-ecological system (SES). Historically, societal demand for oysters has led to destructive and unsustainable levels of harvest, which coupled with multiple other stressors has placed oyster reefs among the most globally imperiled coastal habitats. However, more recent studies have demonstrated that large-scale restoration is possible and that healthy oyster populations can be sustained with effective governance and stewardship. However, both of these require significant societal support or financial investment. In our study, we explored relationships among how coastal societies (1) perceive and value oyster ecosystem services, (2) recognize and define problems associated with oyster decline, and (3) perceive or support stewardship initiatives. We specifically focused on the SES of eastern oysters (Crassostrea virginica) and coastal societies in the northern Gulf of Mexico, a region identified as offering among the last and best opportunities to sustainably balance conservation objectives with a wild fishery. We found that, in addition to harvest-related benefits, oysters were highly valued for providing habitat, mitigating shoreline erosion, and improving water quality or clarity. Our results also showed that although most respondents recognized that oyster populations have declined, many respondents characterized the problem differently than most scientific literature does. Among a variety of initiatives for enhancing sustainability, spawning sanctuaries and reef restoration were well supported in all states, but support for harvest reductions was less consistent. Our study suggests that public support for maintaining both harvest and ecosystem services exists at societal levels and that enhancing public awareness regarding the extent and causes of oyster decline could garner additional support for stewardship initiatives. Collectively, the societal, economic, and biophysical complexities of the northern Gulf of Mexico oyster SES illustrate the need and public support for developing more comprehensive management schemes for exploited ecosystem engineers.},

abstract={For decades, multiple anthropogenic stressors have threatened the Galapagos Islands. Widespread marine pollution such as oil spills, persistent organic pollutants, metals, and ocean plastic pollution has been linked to concerning changes in the ecophysiology and health of Galapagos species. Simultaneously, illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing are reshaping the composition and structure of endemic and native Galapagos pelagic communities. In this novel review, we discuss the impact of anthropogenic pollutants and their associated ecotoxicological implications for Galapagos species in the face of climate change stressors. We emphasize the importance of considering fishing pressure and marine pollution, in combination with climate-change impacts, when assessing the evolutionary fitness of species inhabiting the Galapagos. For example, the survival of endemic marine iguanas has been negatively affected by organic hydrocarbons introduced via oil spills, and endangered Galapagos sea lions exhibit detectable concentrations of DDT, triggering potential feminization effects and compromising the species' survival. During periods of ocean warming (El Nino events) when endemic species undergo nutritional stress, climate change may increase the vulnerability of these species to the impacts of pollutants, resulting in the species reaching its population tipping point. Marine plastics are emerging as a deleterious and widespread threat to endemic species. The Galapagos is treasured for its historical significance and its unparalleled living laboratory and display of evolutionary processes; however, this unique and iconic paradise will remain in jeopardy until multidisciplinary and comprehensive preventative management plans are put in place to mitigate and eliminate the effects of anthropogenic stressors facing the islands today. We present a critical analysis and synthesis of anthropogenic stressors with some progress from local and international institutional efforts and call to action more precautionary measures along with new management philosophies focused on understanding the processes of change through research to champion the conservation of the Galapagos.

title={Transforming (perceived) rigidity in environmental law through adaptive governance: a case of Endangered Species Act implementation},
journal={ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
year={2017},
volume={22},

abstract={The Endangered Species Act (ESA) is often portrayed as a major source of instability and crisis in river basins of the U.S. West, where the needs of listed fish species frequently clash with agriculture dependent on federal irrigation projects subject to ESA Section 7 prohibitions on federal agency actions likely to jeopardize listed species or adversely modify critical habitat. Scholarship on Section 7 characterizes the process as unwaveringly rigid, the legal ``hammer{''} forcing federal agencies to consider endangered species' needs when proposing operations and management plans for federally funded irrigation. In this paper, we identify barriers to an integrated approach to Section 7 implementation and characterize a set of strategies for overcoming its rigidity that may have broader applicability. We draw on lessons derived from the Klamath Basin along the Oregon-California border, where cross-scale processes and venues involving interagency collaboration among leaders in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the National Marine Fisheries Service, and the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation supported efforts to replace an ecologically and socially fragmented Upper Basin/Lower Basin approach to ESA implementation fraught with conflict. The result was the nation's first joint biological opinion (BiOp), which effectively institutionalized an adaptive, flexible, integrated approach to water sharing among competing interests. Keys to success included existing collaborative capacity related to shifting stakeholder networks, trust, and relationships and a shift in local agency culture facilitated by empathic leadership leading to a greater sense of shared responsibility for Section 7 compliance. A collaborative hydrologic modeling process enhanced participatory capacity, facilitated transformative social and technical learning, and cultivated greater understanding of the social-ecological system among key stakeholders. The 2013 joint BiOp exemplifies both governmental capacity for flexibility and evolution within the constraints of formal law and the potential for greater integration among federal agencies and between federal agencies and stakeholders involved in ESA implementation.},

title={Spatial complexity, resilience, and policy diversity: Fishing on lake-rich landscapes},
journal={ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
year={2004},
volume={9},
number={1},
pages={NA},
month={JUN},
abstract={The dynamics of and policies governing spatially coupled social-ecological mosaics are considered for the case of fisheries in a lake district. A microeconomic model of households addresses agent decisions at three hierarchic levels: (1) selection of the lake district from among a larger set of alternative places to live or visit, (2) selection of a base location within the lake district, and (3) selection of a portfolio of ecosystem services to use. Ecosystem services are represented by dynamics of fish production subject to multiple stable domains and trophic cascades. Policy calculations show that optimal policies will be highly heterogeneous in space and fluid in time. The diversity of possible outcomes is illustrated by simulations for a hypothetical lake district based loosely on the Northern Highlands of the State of Wisconsin. Lake districts are frequently managed as if lakes were independent, similar, endogenously regulating systems. Our findings contradict that view. One-size-fits-all (OSFA) policies erode ecological and social resilience. If regulations are too stringent, social resilience declines because of the potential rewards of overharvesting. If regulations are too lax, ecological resilience is diminished by overharvesting in some lakes. In either case, local collapses of fish populations evoke spatial shifts of angling effort that can lead to serial collapses in neighboring fisheries and degraded fisheries in most or all of the lakes. Under OSFA management, the natural resources of the entire landscape become more vulnerable to transformation because of changes in, e.g., human population, the demand for resources, or fish harvesting technology. Multiplicity of management regimes can increase the ecological resilience, social resilience, and inclusive value of a spatially heterogeneous social-ecological system. Because of the complex interactions of mobile people and multistable ecosystems, management regimes must also be flexible over time. A rights-based scheme may facilitate policy regimes with appropriate spatial patterns and intertemporal fluidity. In lake fisheries, habitat protection adds an important dimension to policy design. Habitat is a slowly changing variable that creates ecological resilience and thereby provides managers with a broader range of options.},

pages={29-39},
month={JUN},
abstract={In many coastal regions, activities of multiple users present a growing strain on the ecological state of the area. The necessity of using integrative system approaches to understand and solve coastal problems has become obvious in the last decades. Integrated management strategies for social-ecological systems (SESs) call for the development of SES indicators that help (i) to identify and link the states and processes of social, economic and ecological subsystems and (ii) to balance different stakeholder objectives over the long-term within natural limits. Here we use a system dynamics modeling approach called group model building (GMB) as a diagnostic participative tool for understanding the determinants of characteristic SES issues in the Dutch Wadden Sea region and exploring salient SES indicators for management. We used GMB in two separate workshops for two distinct cases: sustainable mussel fisheries and tourism development. Follow-up online questionnaires elicited relevant variables for deriving SES indicators. In both modeling cases participants identified and connected the variables that expressed fundamental SES dynamics driving each issue. In the mussel fisheries model the central part of the structure was the interaction between the model variables `extent of mussel habitat with high natural value', `mussel cultivation efficiency', and `market supply'. In the tourism model a key driving force for explaining tourist development was the reciprocal relation between the model variables `natural value', `experience value', and `number of tourists'. Application of GMB revealed SES issue complexity and explicitly identified key linkages and potential SES indicators for policy and management in the Dutch Wadden Sea area. As a tool for stakeholder involvement in integrated coastal management the approach enables the joint building of system understanding and the exchange of individual perspectives. Participants agreed with the jointly created models and highly appreciated the way the structured approach facilitated communication and learning about complex and contested issues.

abstract={Climate change and ocean acidification are anticipated to alter marine ecosystems, with consequences for the provision of marine resources and ecosystem services to human societies. However, considerable uncertainties about future ecological changes and ensuing socio-economic impacts impede the identification of societal adaptation strategies. In a case study from the Barents Sea and Northern Norwegian Sea region, we integrated stakeholder perceptions of ecological changes and their significance for societies with the current state of scientific knowledge, to investigate the marine-human system under climate change and identify societal adaptation options. Stakeholders were engaged through personal interviews, two local workshops, and a web based survey, identifying the most relevant ecosystem services potentially impacted and developing an integrated system dynamics model which links climate change scenarios to the response of relevant species. Stakeholder perceptions of temperature-dependent multiannual fluctuations of fish stocks, interactions among fish, marine mammal, and seabird populations, and ecological processes such as primary production are represented in the model. The model was used for a discourse-based stakeholder evaluation of potential ecosystem changes under ocean warming and acidification scenarios, identifying shifts in ecosystem service provision and discussing associated societal adaptation options. The results pointed to differences in adaptive capacity among user groups. Small-scale fishers and tourism businesses are potentially more affected by changing spatial distribution and local declines in marine species than industrial fisheries. Changes in biodiversity, especially extinctions of polar species, and ecosystem functioning were a concern from an environmental conservation viewpoint. When considering potential additional impacts of ocean acidification, changes observed in the model projections were more uniformly valued as negative, and associated with an increased potential for conflicts among user groups. The stakeholder-informed ecosystem modeling approach has succeeded in driving a discussion and interchange among stakeholder groups and with scientists, integrating knowledge about climate change impacts in the social-ecological system and identifying important factors that shape societal responses. The approach can thus serve to improve governance of marine systems by incorporating knowledge about system dynamics and about societal uses and values.},

volume={114},

pages={204-217},
month={SEP},
abstract={Fisheries exemplify the immense complexity of interactions in social-ecological systems (SESs). This complexity has created management challenges and raises concerns for the sustainability of our marine natural resource systems. This article contributes to SES fisheries research and management in two ways: first, it enhances our understanding of lobster fisheries as complex social-ecological systems, focusing on the Southern California Spiny Lobster Fishery (SCSLF) as a case study. Secondly, it demonstrates a methodological approach for assessing component interactions in SESs that can be used to assess the sustainability of management approaches. The first contribution involves the systematic review of the literature on lobster fisheries management and their SES characteristics. The review results are then used to modify and extensively define the diagnostic SES framework for specific use in lobster fisheries. For the second contribution, we demonstrate how to operationalize the modified framework for the diagnosis of a real-life case, using the SCSLF as an example. This involves framing the SCSLF classificatory diagnosis for analysis of the stakeholder-comprised management group of the SCSLF as a social-ecological action situation. This analysis is aided by the Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) framework, a SES-imbedded tool used in our case to assess sustainability in resource management systems through critical analysis of stakeholder and resource system interactions. More generally, we find that research in lobster fisheries could benefit from broadening its scope of analysis, as overly narrow research foci have worked to limit the production of more holistic SES knowledge. Our exemplary analysis of the LAC's management of the SCSLF shows that the SES contains multiple components which have been associated with sustainable outcomes elsewhere; however, the fishery still faces many obstacles, including how to adapt to future challenges. Our results contribute to developing a holistic methodological approach for operationalizing SES framework research into practical fisheries management. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The unusual situation that arose due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the 65-day fishing ban (national policy to boost depleted fish stocks) affected the lower-income fishing communities in coastal Bangladesh. Shocks and stresses were posed, and community people adopted strategies to adapt to the changes. In the process of adaptation, social-ecological systems resilience at different levels plays a crucial role. Though resilience is acknowledged as multilevel feature, studies on the interaction between the levels while understanding communities' responses to shock and stress are limited. Thus, in this study, we explored the shocks and stresses the fishing community faced and their views on the resilience feature at different levels (i.e., individual, household, and community level) in coastal Bangladesh during the COVID-19 pandemic and 65-day fishing ban period. The study found that the most resilience promoting features (e.g., diversified livelihood, friendship, and network of supports) were adopted at the individual and household levels. However, positive and negative interactions were explored between resilience features at all levels. Low community-level resilience was not translated into a lack of household-level resilience, and strong individual-level resilience did not mean high household-level resilience. It was noted that the increased resilience of a particular individual or household could negatively affect community resilience. Resilience features showed inconsistent interactions within or among the three levels' resilience features. The study also revealed that multilevel resilience features stressed the importance of combining persistence (i.e., keeping fishing as the main livelihood) and adaptation process (e.g., livelihood diversification). The study showcases the importance of considering multilevel resilience that offers insight into crucial resilience factors which would not be evident if only one level were studied. The overall finding of this study will contribute to framing governance strategies to ensure sustainable coastal management even in the time of any abrupt or expected changes, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the fishing ban policy.},

abstract={We investigate the operationalization of an integrated and deliberative multidimensional assessment (distribution of socioeconomic activities across marine spaces, risk to ecosystem levels, pressures on ecosystem services, and conflicts) in a Brazilian subtropical coastal-estuarine social-ecological system that is currently changing from a fragmented and sectoral governance system towards an ecosystem-based regime. Based on the perception of five direct ecosystem user groups (aquatic transport, tourism and recreation, mariculture, mining, and fisheries) we explored how the multidimensional assessment approach may inform ecologically coherent and socially equitable coastal governance and development. We conducted three cycles of participatory planning workshops (n = 39) with all groups: to map uses and activities across 7 contextually different planning units; to identify conflicts; and to assess the spatial distribution of risks to the ecosystem. We mapped the spatial distribution of 28 activities that directly generate provisioning and cultural ecosystem services (ES), and their associated indirect impact-chains on all ESs types and affected users. A total of 44 conflicts (32 inter- and 12 intra-sectoral) were discussed, and were higher in more intensely used areas. A habitat risk assessment scaled-up an ecosystem-level understanding of areas in need of urgent management. Important habitats (mangroves, submerged rocky outcrops, soft bottoms, water column) are facing high levels of risk; and a significant heterogeneity in spatial distribution of risk justifies radically alternative, contextually-based management and development measures to challenge the status quo. We conclude that the ecosystem services will likely continue to benefit present and future generations if an ecosystem-based management approach is consistently adopted with five sets of priorities: 1) advance plural valuation mechanisms with awareness of pressure-levels on the ecosystem; 2) manage conflicts while creating synergies amongst existing activities across space; 3) avoid expansion of pressure on ecologically sensitive areas; 4) consolidate the emerging novel democratic governance mechanism; and 5) explore the transferability approach's potential to scale-up coastal governance transformation in Brazil.},

abstract={The definition of a common vision that includes social and environmental goals, ecosystem services and/or biodiversity features that people are interested in maintaining or restoring is a great challenge for marine protected areas (MPAs). Recent initiatives have promoted broadening the focus from biodiversity conservation alone to the conservation of both ecosystem services and biodiversity, indicating that this integration should improve support and compliance from stakeholders. Using a Multiple-Use Coastal Marine Protected Area recently proposed in northern Chile, we investigated (i) stakeholders' perceptions of the valuation of ecosystem services, threats to their provision, and the prioritization of ecosystem services, biodiversity features, and uses in a planning scenario, and (ii) stakeholders' expectations for the establishment of a new MPA. The perceptions of different groups of stakeholders were compared and statistically analyzed, and the relationships among prioritizations were studied using a network approach. Stakeholders identified and valued 13 ecosystem services, 28 biodiversity features, 20 uses and activities, and 22 threats. Significant differences among the valuations and prioritizations of different stakeholder groups were attributable principally to artisanal fishermen's perceptions of some components that are directly related to their activities and livelihoods. High expectations of benefits from a new MPA implementation were observed for all categories of stakeholders. To relate the different valuated components, we proposed a network-based conceptual model that reduces complexity, and also as a strategy to communicate relationships and trade-offs occurring in this particular social-ecological system to the several stakeholders. We strongly recommend early stakeholder engagement so as to understand the variability in environmental perceptions and then reflect that variation in the planning and management actions of MPAs, thus improving support for their implementation and achieving conservation and societal goals. Our findings indicate that stakeholders' perceptions and prioritizadons of ecosystem services, biodiversity features and uses should be used as the basis for starting the MPA implementation and planning process.

abstract={The small-fisheries social-ecological system in the western Indian Ocean (WIO) represents a typical social-ecological trap setting where very poor natural resources dependent coastal communities face local and global threats and engage in unsustainable practices of exploiting limited resources. Community-based aquaculture (CBA) has been implemented as an important alternative or supplementary income generating activity for minimizing the overdependence on marine natural resources and promoting biodiversity conservation. Despite its proliferation throughout the WIO region in recent decades, little is known about the degree to which CBA activities have contributed to achieving the objectives of breaking the cycle of poverty and environmental degradation and promoting community development and biodiversity conservation. In order to improve understanding of common challenges and to generate recommendations for best practice, we assessed the most common CBA activities practiced in the region through literature review and workshop discussion involving practitioners and key stakeholders. Findings indicated that despite favorable environmental conditions for various CBA practices, the sector remains underdeveloped, with few activities delivering the intended benefits for coastal livelihoods or conservation. Constraints included a shortage of seed and feed supplies, low investment, limited technical capacity and skills, insufficient political support, and lack of a clear strategy for aquaculture development. These are compounded by a lack of engagement of local stakeholders, with decision making often dominated by donors, development agencies, and private sector partners. Many of the region's CBA projects are designed along unrealistically short time frames, driven by donors rather than entrepreneurs, and so are unable to achieve financial sustainability, which limits the opportunity for capacity building and longer-term development. There is little or no monitoring on ecological and socioeconomic impacts. Except for a few isolated cases, links between CBA and marine conservation outcomes have rarely been demonstrated. Realizing the potential of CBA in contributing toward food security in the WIO will necessitate concerted investment and capacity strengthening to overcome these systemic challenges in the sector. Lessons herein offer managers, scientists, and policy advisors guidance on addressing the challenges faced in building strategic development initiatives around aquaculture in developing countries.},

abstract={People in the Northeast United States have a long history of benefitting from the ocean in many ways, exemplified by the region's important cod and lobster fisheries, coastal tourism and recent expansion of offshore energy. Over the past few decades, the region has become one of the fastest warming spots on the planet, has seen significant growth in coastal populations, and expansion of new sectors into the marine environment, resulting in ecosystem shifts and changes to the supply and distribution of these benefits. With these changes comes a need for measuring ocean health to understand how engagement with the ocean may be affected, and how regional management may need to adapt. To address this need, we tailored the Ocean Health Index framework to the U.S. Northeast region, scoring eight distinct goals for ocean health on a scale of 0 to 100 for 11 sub-regions over 13 years (2005-2017). All goal scores were averaged resulting in an Ocean Health Index score of 83 for the Northeast in 2017. This score fluctuated by 1 point in either direction (82-84) in the previous 12 years. The lowest scoring goals in 2017 also exhibited the highest volatility since 2005, Food Provision (64) and Resource Access Opportunities (71). The region's highest goal scores came from Livelihoods \& Economies (99) and Biodiversity (90) and remained stable during the study period. Clean Waters scores had a steady, significant downward trend since 2005, while Resource Access Opportunities and Aquaculture show the largest improvements. This synthesis of over 50 datasets to create annual aggregate scores provides the public, government and non-government agencies with an easily digestible summary of how the region is faring in regards to ocean health. Perhaps even more importantly, this synthesis allows for the tracking of trends over time and the ability to quickly identify and prioritize low-scoring components of ocean health that could benefit from dedicated resources for improvement. As managers plan for the future in a changing Northeast marine region, the ability to track annual changes in ocean health and its respective components is key to making decisions that benefit the entire social-ecological system.

abstract={The move towards broader management of marine ecosystems has received significant momentum in recent years. Fundamental to Ecosystem-Based Management (EBM) and Ecosystem-Based Fisheries management (EBFM) is the need to engage relevant stakeholder groups. Here we present a Bayesian network (BN) tool developed to describe the snapper population in the Hauraki Gulf, New Zealand, and investigate possible outcomes of alternative management scenarios on snapper abundance. The Hauraki Gulf is a location where the marine environment is both highly valued and in high demand for the goods and services it provides. Snapper are a key component of this social-ecological system. We developed a BN focussed on key snapper life stages, and the consequences of stressors, including fishing, uses of marine space, land use practises (which influence sediment and nutrient yield), biogenic and environmental habitat variables, and upper level drivers such as climate change, human population growth and the global economy. Parameters were populated through a range of information types, from empirical and model analysis to literature review and expert opinion. Parameters for the core of the BN model (i.e. the snapper life stages and fishing methods) were adjusted so that the predicted effects of fishing reflected those seen in model projections from an age structured population model that had recently been used to inform the management of the snapper population in the Hauraki Gulf. The two most influential factors within this BN were fishing and land-use practises. Although there was a strong impact on snapper populations from land-use practises and resulting sedimentation that detrimentally affects biogenic habitats that juvenile snapper depend on, the potential impact of fishery extraction was much stronger. While fishery extraction of snapper is generally well managed, under the existing management set up it is also the only major stressor that would likely be regulated in response to decreases in the snapper population (regardless of the source of any impact). Engaging stakeholders to address issues such as this remains the greatest challenge facing EBFM/EBM in the Hauraki Gulf, but may be possible with tools such as the BN presented here.},

pages={705-746},

abstract={Costa Rica is supporting Marine Areas of Responsible Fishing (AMPRs) to enable small-scale fishing communities to apply for exclusive harvesting and management rights within spatially delimited areas under a co-management policy framework. Communities need to self-organize their own fishing association and develop a fishing management plan (POP) to apply. Seven AMPRs have been established in the Gulf of Nicoya, highlighting Costa Rica's efforts to follow the FAO Small-Scale Fisheries Guidelines, but all face collective action challenges to develop and achieve common goals and implementation. In this article, we conduct a qualitative comparative analysis by applying the Social-Ecological System Framework (SESF) as a tool to identify the social and ecological conditions influencing collective action and co-management in three AMPRs in the Gulf of Nicoya, and we compare the similarities and differences between them. Our findings show that all three AMPRs face collective action challenges for different reasons. Nonetheless, some commonalities exist. Common drivers have motivated collective action in the creation of the AMPRs, including the desire to restrict certain types of fishing gears due to perceptions of resource scarcity and high dependence on local resources. Variables such as monitoring and sanctioning mechanisms, strong leadership and the economic heterogeneity of actors positively influence collective action in management. However, there are also variables hindering collective action, such as mistrust among actors, internal conflicts, lack of governmental support and resource unit mobility. Our findings suggest that AMPRs are a promising and potentially effective governance strategy because they can empower marginalized small-scale fishing communities and bring them into national development processes. However, there is an evident need for more state and local community investment into capacity building for self-organization and deliberation processes that can better enable AMPRs to move beyond ``paper parks{''}, and towards being a practically useful governance strategy to showcase Costa Rica's commitment to FAO Small-Scale Fisheries Guidelines. Adapting the AMPR model to fit the social-ecological context of each community is critical for success, despite the perceived similarity between the AMPRs.},

title={Historical declines in parrotfish on Belizean coral reefs linked to shifts in reef exploitation following European colonization},

abstract={Humans have utilized the Mesoamerican Reef (MAR) for millennia but the effects of prehistorical and historical fishing on this ecosystem remain understudied. To assess the long-term coupling of reef ecosystem and human dynamics in this region, we tracked trends in the structure and functioning of lagoonal reefs within the Belizean portion of the MAR using fish teeth fossils and sediment accumulation rates within reef sediment cores. We then paired this with a timeline of demographic and cultural changes in this region's human populations. The similar to 1,300-year timeline encompassed in the core record shows that declines in the relative abundance and accumulation rate of teeth from parrotfish, a key reef herbivore, occurred at all three reef sites and began between similar to 1500 and 1800 AD depending on site and metric of abundance. A causality analysis showed that parrotfish relative abundance had a positive causal effect on reef accretion rates, a proxy of coral growth, reconfirming the important role of these fish in reef ecosystem functioning. The timing of initial declines in parrotfish teeth occurred during a time of relatively low human population density in Belize. However, declines were synchronous with cultural and demographic upheaval resulting from European colonization of the New World. The more recent declines at these sites (similar to 1800 AD) occurred in tandem with increased subsistence fishing on reefs by multiple immigrant groups, a pattern that was likely necessitated by the establishment of an import economy controlled by a small group of land-owning European elites. These long-term trends from the paleoecological record reveal that current parrotfish abundances in central Belize are well below their pre-European contact peaks and that increased fishing pressure on parrotfish post-contact has likely caused a decline in reef accretion rates. The origins of reef degradation in the Belizean portion of the MAR began hundreds of years before the onset of modern declines resulting from the combined effects of local human disturbances and climate change.},

title={Searching for responsible and sustainable recreational fisheries in the Anthropocene},
journal={JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY},

volume={94},
number={6, SI},
pages={845-856},
month={JUN},
abstract={Recreational fisheries that use rod and reel (i.e., angling) operate around the globe in diverse freshwater and marine habitats, targeting many different gamefish species and engaging at least 220 million participants. The motivations for fishing vary extensively; whether anglers engage in catch-and-release or are harvest-oriented, there is strong potential for recreational fisheries to be conducted in a manner that is both responsible and sustainable. There are many examples of recreational fisheries that are well-managed where anglers, the angling industry and managers engage in responsible behaviours that both contribute to long-term sustainability of fish populations and the sector. Yet, recreational fisheries do not operate in a vacuum; fish populations face threats and stressors including harvest from other sectors as well as environmental change, a defining characteristic of the Anthropocene. We argue that the future of recreational fisheries and indeed many wild fish populations and aquatic ecosystems depends on having responsible and sustainable (R\&S) recreational fisheries whilst, where possible, addressing, or at least lobbying for increased awareness about the threats to recreational fisheries emanating from outside the sector (e.g., climate change). Here, we first consider how the concepts of R\&S intersect in the recreational fishing sector in an increasingly complex socio-cultural context. Next, we explore the role of the angler, angling industry and decision-makers in achieving R\&S fisheries. We extend this idea further by considering the consequences of a future without recreational fisheries (either because of failures related to R\&S) and explore a pertinent case study situated in Uttarakahand, India. Unlike other fisheries sectors where the number of participants is relatively small, recreational angling participants are numerous and widespread, such that if their actions are responsible, they have the potential to be a key voice for conservation and serve as a major force for good in the Anthropocene. What remains to be seen is whether this will be achieved, or if failure will occur to the point that recreational fisheries face increasing pressure to cease, as a result of external environmental threats, the environmental effects of recreational fishing and emerging ethical concerns about the welfare of angled fish.},

title={Social-ecological dimensions of Marine Protected Areas and coastal fishing: How fishermen's local ecological knowledge can inform fisheries management at the future ``Taza{''} MPA (Algeria, SW Mediterranean)},

abstract={The aim of this paper is to examine fishermen's Local Ecological Knowledge (LEK) relating to Marine Protected Area (MPA) planning and the overlap with fisheries management in the future ``Taza{''} MPA (Algeria, SW Mediterranean). The case study focuses on both commercial and recreational coastal fisheries from the fishing harbour of Ziama (NE Algeria). In this area, coastal fishing is carried out by professional small-scale fishers and purse seiners for commercial fishery and by recreational boat fishers for recreational fishery. While there have been some science-based studies in the characterization of this coastal fishery by using direct observation of landings as a method for estimating catch and fishing effort, fishermen's LEK remains under-utilized in this Social-Ecological System (SES). To address this knowledge gap, perceptions regarding: (1) biological and ecological impacts of coastal fisheries, (2) marine ecosystem health and (3) attitudes towards the proposed MPA regulations were analyzed in order to assess potential social-ecological impacts which can inform more accurately on MPA planning and fisheries management in the future. To this end, thirty face-to-face semi-structured interviews with fishers at Ziama harbour were carried out between June and September 2017. The study found that the future establishment of the ``Taza{''} MPA may affect the fisheries in this area in the short-term, and in particular the jobs and livelihoods of professional fishers by limiting the fishing area through new fishing restrictions. The fishermen's LEK provided some capacity to understand the heterogeneity of the SES in place and may be used as a tool to evaluate the outcome of fishery management actions. The results indicate higher acceptance rates among recreational than professional fishers regarding no-take zones. Professional fishers were proportionately more likely to oppose the new regulations, though 53\% of the fishers surveyed were uncertain about the future positive impacts of the MPA. The LEK provides managers with a level of detail about the prediction and prevention of fishermen opposition, and can point out opportunities for improving conservation policy with respect to social acceptance.},

year={2022},
volume={3},

month={NOV 2},
abstract={The impacts of fisheries interactions on cetaceans can be challenging to determine, often requiring multiple complementary investigative approaches. The Yangtze finless porpoise (Neophocaena asiaeorientalis asiaeorientalis), one of the few Critically Endangered cetaceans, is endemic to the middle-lower Yangtze drainage, a system impacted by multiple anthropogenic pressures. Bycatch mortality is implicated in regional porpoise decline, but the significance and dynamics of porpoise interactions with fishing activities and other threats remain poorly understood. We conducted boat-based surveys to map seasonal distributions and spatial congruence of porpoises and two potential threats (fishing and sand-mining), and an interview survey of fishing communities to understand temporal patterns and drivers of regional fishing activity, across Poyang Lake and the adjoining Yangtze mainstem. Variation in harmful and non-harmful gear use (non-fixed nets versus static pots and traps) between these landscapes might be an important factor affecting local porpoise status. Within Poyang Lake, spatial correlations between porpoises and threats were relatively weak, seasonal porpoise and threat hotspots were located in different regions, and two protected areas had higher porpoise encounter rates and densities than some unprotected sections. However, porpoise hotspots were mostly in unprotected areas, threats were widely observed across reserves, and more fishing and sand-mining was seasonally observed within reserves than within unprotected areas. Compared to null distributions, porpoises were detected significantly closer to fishing activities in summer and further from sand-mining in winter, indicating possible spatial risks of gear entanglement and disturbance. Reported porpoise bycatch deaths are associated with fixed and non-fixed nets, hook-based gears, and electrofishing. Longitudinal patterns in reported gear use indicate that hook-based fishing has decreased substantially and is generally conducted by older fishers, and significantly fewer respondents now practice fishing as their sole source of income, but electrofishing has increased. This combined research approach indicates a continued potential risk to porpoises from changing fisheries interactions and other threats, highlighting the importance of fishing restrictions and appropriate support for fishing communities impacted by this legislation. A potential ``win-win{''} for both biodiversity and local livelihoods could be achieved through wider use of static pots and traps, which are not associated with bycatch deaths.},

year={2021},
volume={13},

abstract={The importance of recreational fishing, in many coastal areas and less developed nations, is increasing rapidly. Connecting fisheries to tourism can create innovative tourism products and provide new income sources. The present study is the first to explore the concept of coastal fishery-based ecotourism (FbE) to enhance the social-ecological resilience of coastal fishing communities in a specific tourist spot in Bangladesh. A combination of primary (quantitative and qualitative) and secondary (literature databases) data sources were used in this study. It applied a social-ecological system (SES) and social-ecological resilience (SER) concept to collect quantitative and qualitative data (120 in-depth individual interviews, four focus group discussions, and strengths, weakness, opportunities, and threats-SWOT analyses) and frame their interpretation. The study found that Bangladesh needs to adopt a firm policy to utilize tourism's potential in national economic development and societal progress. The findings show the considerable potential of the concept that integrates business, education, and an environmental conservation perspective in Bangladesh, specifically for Saint Martin's Island: 32\% of interviewees expressed that increasing employment opportunities and the Gross Domestic Products (GDP) is the primary potential, whereas 31\% said it would attract fishing tourists and 23\% believed it would develop the local infrastructure and facilities for fishing and tourism. Similarly, most of the respondents (31\%) thought that the lack of awareness and promotional activities is the main limitation preventing this initiative from being well accepted. Moreover, based on the findings, specific measures for strengthening the social-ecological resilience of the coastal fishers via FbE at the local level were suggested, including building communal links, developing community infrastructures, revising prevailing rules and regulations, offering alternative means of generating income for fishers during disaster periods, and more active sharing of responsibility between stakeholders and government for the management of FbE. Finally, with its focus on the prospects and challenges of coastal FbE development on Saint Martin's Island, this article provides a useful reference point for future discourse on similar social and economic strategies. While this study focuses on Bangladesh's coastal fishing villages, the results are possibly applicable more broadly in similar contexts and developing countries worldwide.},

title={Exploring Resilience and Transformability of a River Basin in the Face of Socioeconomic and Ecological Crisis: an Example from the Amudarya River Basin, Central Asia},

abstract={Water from the Amudarya River is a vital and strategic resource for semi-arid Uzbekistan because of its heavy reliance on irrigated agriculture. The Uzbek water management regime, however, has proven to be rather reluctant to adapt to changing environmental and socio-political conditions despite recent massive pressures caused by political, environmental, or donor-induced developments in the region. The aim of this paper is to explore reasons for the low adaptability of the Uzbek water sector and assess implications for the resilience of the Uzbek social-ecological system (SES). By analyzing past losses of resilience as well as first attempts at institutional change in land and water management, we identify drivers as well as structural factors and mechanisms that act as barriers for adaptation and transformation towards a more sustainable system. With the collapse of the Aral Sea fisheries and the basin-wide large scale soil salinization, the SES in the Amudarya River Basin has shifted to a new, less desirable regime. However, the high resilience of the social system is keeping it in its current undesirable state and further degrades its long-term resilience. Our analysis identifies reinforcing feedbacks caused by ecological dynamics, vested interests, and a patronage system that contribute to the resistance to change and keep the system locked in its current unsustainable state. These factors are rooted in the history of the SES in the river basin, such as the economic dependence on cotton and the state-centered management approach. The window of opportunity for significant changes of the larger scale institutional setting that might have been open after the breakup of the Soviet Union was or could not be used to achieve a transformation to more sustainable resources use. Measures aimed at an incremental improvement of the current situation are not sufficient to prevent further losses of resilience. Resilience and transformability of the larger scale SES (political, economic, and institutional settings) are needed to enable the smaller scales (regional and local water management) to adapt and change. However, we identified opportunities for change arising from the slow acceptance of bottom-up management institutions in the water sector and from the extensive restoration capacity of the ecosystems.},

month={APR},
abstract={Many coastal communities depend on ecosystems for goods and services that contribute to human well-being. As long-standing interactions between people and nature are modified by global environmental change, dynamic and diversified livelihood strategies that enable seasonal adaptation will be critical for vulnerable coastal communities. However, the success of such strategies depends on a range of poorly understood influences. Gleaning, the hand-based collection of marine organisms from littoral habitats, provides an interesting case study of dynamic change in social-ecological interactions. It is an important coastal livelihood strategy, yet seasonal gleaning dynamics have not been empirically explored in contemporary communities. We examined seasonal gleaning in eight coastal communities on Atauro Island, Timor-Leste, using household surveys and satellite-derived maps of shallow-water benthic habitats. Our analysis explored the factors affecting household decisions to glean in each season, the relationship between gleaning and seafood consumption, and seasonal gleaning pressure on near-shore coastal resources. Dynamic marine harvesting strategies differed among households and gleaning activity was seasonally heterogeneous. Not all gleaning households gleaned during the season characterised by rough sea conditions despite rough season gleaning being associated with greater seafood consumption stability among seasons. Households also gleaned less regularly, and catches were smaller, in the rough season. Differences in seasonal participation in gleaning were explained mostly by type and extent of shallow habitat proximate to a community. In the calm season, household gleaning was positively related to the total area of shallow habitat, and in the rough season the percentage of hard-bottom shallow habitat was also an important predictor of gleaning activity. Our findings illustrate how changes in the biophysical environment mediate human-nature interactions at fine scales through time and space. Consequently, this research highlights the importance of context-specific perspectives for understanding drivers and dynamics in fishing pressure on littoral ecosystems, access to ecosystem benefits and limits to adaptation. Factors influencing when livelihood activities are feasible and desirable are important for evaluating the social impacts of climate change, particularly in the context of rural communities in the Global South.

title={Red and green loops help uncover missing feedbacks in a coral reef social-ecological system},
journal={PEOPLE AND NATURE},
year={2020},
volume={2},
number={3},
pages={608-618},
month={SEP},
abstract={Social-ecological systems (SES) exhibit complex cause-and-effect relationships. Capturing, interpreting, and responding to signals that indicate changes in ecosystems is key for sustainable management in SES. Breaks in this signal-response chain, when feedbacks are missing, will allow change to continue until a point when abrupt ecological surprises may occur. In these situations, societies and local ecosystems can often become uncoupled. In this paper, we demonstrate how the red loop-green loop (RL-GL) concept can be used to uncover missing feedbacks and to better understand past social-ecological dynamics. Reinstating these feedbacks in order to recouple the SES may ultimately create more sustainable systems on local scales. The RL-GL concept can uncover missing feedbacks through the characterization of SES dynamics along a spectrum of human resource dependence. Drawing on diverse qualitative and quantitative data sources, we classify SES dynamics throughout the history of Jamaican coral reefs along the RL-GL spectrum. We uncover missing feedbacks in red-loop and red-trap scenarios from around the year 600 until now. The Jamaican coral reef SES dynamics have moved between all four dynamic states described in the RL-GL concept: green loop, green trap, red loop and red trap. We then propose mechanisms to guide the current unsustainable red traps back to more sustainable green loops, involving mechanisms of seafood trade and ecological monitoring. By gradually moving away from seafood exports, Jamaica may be able to return to green-loop dynamics between the local society and their locally sourced seafood. We discuss the potential benefits and drawbacks of this proposed intervention and give indications of why an export ban may insure against future missing feedbacks and could prolong the sustainability of the Jamaican coral reef ecosystem. Our approach demonstrates how the RL-GL approach can uncover missing feedbacks in a coral reef SES, a way the concept has not been used before. We advocate for how the RL-GL concept in a feedback setting can be used to synthesize various types of data and to gain an understanding of past, present and future sustainability that can be applied in diverse social-ecological settings.

title={Fishers perceptions of ecosystem service change associated with climate-disturbed coral reefs},
journal={PEOPLE AND NATURE},
year={2021},
volume={3},
number={3},
pages={639-657},
month={JUN},
abstract={Understanding ecosystem service change necessitates an understanding of the social and ecological dimensions of ecosystem services and how they contribute to the well-being of different people. These empirical research gaps persist across the tropics and in coastal environments, posing a challenge for small island states that depend on ecosystem services associated with near-shore ecosystems like coral reefs. Perception-based approaches allow for a rapid appraisal of what constitutes ecosystem service change, providing insights into why these changes matter, and how experiences of change differ between individuals. To capture perceptions of change in four ecosystem services associated with coral reefs (habitat, fishery, coastal protection and recreation services), we conducted 41 semi-structured interviews with coral reef fishers from Seychelles, where reef ecosystems have been severely impacted by climate disturbance. We gathered quantitative and qualitative data to understand (a) if and what changes in reef-associated ecosystem services have been perceived; (b) if fishers' characteristics are associated with differences in perceived changes and (c) which changes matter most in fishers' lives. Using a three-dimensional approach to well-being, we sought to identify whether reasons behind the importance of change connect to fishers' well-being. There have been noticeable changes across all four ecosystem services investigated. Changes include social, ecological and behavioural dynamics. Every fisher perceived at least one ecosystem service change but fishers who dive/snorkel or work from larger boats perceived a higher number of ecosystem services to have changed. Education, age and participation in snorkelling/diving were associated with fishers who identified changing habitat services as most important, whereas fishers from families with fewer livelihood alternatives and from smaller islands identified changing fishery services as most important. Different aspects of the subjective, relational and material dimensions of well-being were implicated in why changing services matter. Despite known ecological shifts in reef condition, this research is one of few studies to empirically show how changes across multiple ecosystem services are being perceived. These perceived changes are complex, engage both the social and ecological dimensions of services, and connect in multiple ways to how fishers feel about their lives, their relationships and material well-being.

title={Managing social-ecological systems under uncertainty: implementation in the real world},
journal={ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
year={2014},
volume={19},
number={2},
pages={NA},
month={NA},
abstract={Management decisions for natural resources are not made in a vacuum; the environmental and ecological conditions as well as the socioeconomic and political contexts affect goals, the choice of interventions, their feasibility, and which outcomes are obtained. Although uncertainty is recognized as a feature of natural resource management, little attention has been given to the uncertainty generated by institutional settings, historical contingency, and individual people's influence. These implementation uncertainties, related to the translation of policy into practice, make it difficult to predict the outcomes of management interventions within social-ecological systems. Using the conservation of species hunted for bushmeat in the Serengeti as a case study, we investigated the challenges and potential barriers to successful implementation of natural resource management policies. We used a mixed-methods approach, combining semistructured interviews with scenario building, social network, and institutional analysis exercises. Using a management strategy evaluation (MSE) conceptual framework, we obtained insights into the constraints and opportunities for fulfilling stakeholder aspirations for the social-ecological system, analyzed the multiple roles played by different institutions in the system, and described the interactions between different actor types. We found that the respondents had generally similar views about the current and future status of the Serengeti but disagreed about how to address issues of conservation concern and were more uncertain about the actual outcomes of management interventions. Improving conservation implementation (rather than research, monitoring, or status assessment) was perceived as the key priority to be addressed. Institutional barriers were perceived as an important challenge given that the decision-making and implementation processes were broadly distributed across a number of institutions. Conservation social networks were centered on very few individuals, suggesting their importance in bridging across conservation arenas but also potentially affecting the resilience of governance structures. Our study gives an improved understanding of the underlying causes of discrepancies between conservation plans and outcomes for this case study, as well as providing a novel framework for the analysis of implementation uncertainties more broadly. A next step would be to use this framework as a basis for collaboratively developed models that integrate research findings with specific management questions. By bringing tools and findings from social psychology, natural resource management, and bioeconomics together into a unified operational framework, researchers may be better able to understand the barriers to successful resource management and engage with stakeholders to overcome them.},

abstract={Trophic models of the Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE) type and local ecological knowledge (LEK) have widely been applied to fisheries assessment and management. However, there are no specific methodologies describing how LEK from local fishers can be incorporated with the scientific data from the models in the context of ecosystem-based fisheries management. To our knowledge this is the first contribution exploring a systematic integration of LEK with EwE modeled output. An EwE food web model of the Nicoya Gulf ecosystem constructed 20 years ago and recently revisited by the authors and collaborators, was used in workshops to stimulate discussion among local stakeholders regarding changes in the marine ecosystem. For this study, 58 artisanal fishers were recruited to eight workshops. To assess the LEK, we documented the discussions, and the qualitative data were analyzed with quantitative frequency of responses to identify trends. Next, we systematically compared the changes in the fishery over time through an analysis of similar, complementary, and contradictory information across knowledge systems. In general, the analysis across systems reflected changes in species composition of the catches, paralleled by a harvest reduction in high-trophic-level species, as well as economic losses due to a shift in harvesting low-value species and due to an increase in operational costs. Particularly, we identified (1) similar pieces of information that delivered the same message, providing robust evidence of changes in the social-ecological system; (2) information complementary to each other, which together provided a broader picture (descriptors and attributes) of the changes of some fishing resources; and (3) conflicting pieces of information that indicated mismatches between sources of knowledge, which might suggest the cause of management problems. This study demonstrated how integrating knowledge systems can enhance our understanding of the state and changes in ecosystems, helping to improve fisheries management. We also found that an EwE model can be an effective communication tool to be used with fishers and to promote discussion and engagement. Our aspiration is to bring new and replicable tools to the policy interface in Latin-American fisheries, based on both stakeholder participation (including LEK) and the best scientific information available.},

abstract={In several tropical forested areas in which biodiversity conservation and indigenous cultures are interwoven, current conservation policies do not consider how the indigenous communities understand the concept of conservation that is promoted and implemented by conservation programs led by external actors, nor do they consider local traditional practices of resource management. To move towards more inclusive conservation policies that take these two aspects into account, research is required in indigenous settings that can inform policy makers. The present study, carried out in the lowland Maya area of Mexico, aims to investigate local meanings of rainforest conservation and dynamics of land use in two Maya common property holdings or `ejidos' (Noh cah and X-Maben). The study used a Social-Ecological Systems approach comprising: (i) the Maya communities and their local meanings of conservation as a Social Subsystem, assessed through social surveys, and (ii) the rainforest of each studied ejido - which was regarded as an Ecological Subsystem and assessed through satellite images (from 2000 to 2012). In the former, interviewees were asked: ``when you hear the phrase `conservation of the rainforest' what do you think is being said?{''} They were also asked if there were local words in Maya or Spanish that were similar in meaning to the aforementioned phrase. The results relating to the meanings of conservation demonstrate that Maya people, who rely on the rainforest for multiple livelihoods, understand two types of meanings for looking after the rainforest; one promoted by governmental conservation programs, and the other called Kanan K'aax, a Maya phrase that represents their customary or community-based rainforest conservation. Differences between these two models of conservation encompass differences with respect to scale, gender and the Maya people's own cultural practices. The results of the local dynamics of land use demonstrate that the landscapes of both study sites are dominated by mature rainforest (ranging from 73.9-82.7\%), and are therefore in a good state of conservation, and that their agricultural frontiers have not expanded. Our empirical results are valuable in terms of informing the scientific community about the state of rainforest conservation in the Maya Zone, and providing policy makers (from the Maya area and elsewhere) with information to devise new, more inclusive conservation policies that take full account of the indigenous cultural practices of rainforest management.},

abstract={Oyster reef ecosystems used to form significant components of many temperate and subtropical inshore coastal systems but have suffered declines globally, with a concurrent loss of services. The early timing of many of these changes makes it difficult to determine restoration targets which consider interdecadal timeframes, community values and shifted baselines. On the Australian continent, however, the transition from Indigenous (Aboriginal) to Westernized resource use and management occurred relatively recently, allowing us to map social-ecological changes in detail. In this study, we reconstruct the transformations in the Sydney rock oyster (Saccostrea glomerata) wild commercial industry of central and southeast Queensland, and by extension its reef ecosystems, as well as the changing societal and cultural values related to the presence and use of the rock oyster through time. By integrating data from the archaeological, anthropological and fisheries literature, government and media accounts, we explore these transformations over the last two centuries. Before the 1870s, there was a relative equilibrium. Aboriginal peoples featured as sole traders to Europeans, supplying oysters and becoming a substantial component of the industry's labour pool. Effectively, Australia's commercial oyster industry arose from Aboriginal-European trade. During this initial phase, there was still a relative abundance of wild oyster, with subtidal oyster reef structures present in regions where oysters are today absent or scarce. By contrast, these reefs declined by the late 19th century, despite production of oysters increasing due to continued large-scale oyster recruitment and the expansion of oyster cultivation in intertidal areas. Production peaked in 1891, with successive peaks observed in regions further north. During the 1890s, flood events coupled with land-use changes introduced large quantities of silt into the system, which likely facilitated an increase in oyster pests and diseases, ultimately decreasing the carrying capacity of the system. Today oyster production in this region is less than one-tenth of historical peak production. Many cultural heritage components have also been lost. Indigenous management is now very minor due to the massive decimation of Aboriginal populations and their respective practices. Yet, we found strong cultural attachment to midden remains and oyster production continues within Indigenous communities, with considerable broader community support. This study highlights the value of conducting thorough analysis of early media accounts as a means for reconstructing historical resource decline and management. It further demonstrates the application of historical information and context for contemporary management, protection and restoration of much-altered coastal social-ecological systems.},

abstract={Small-scale fisheries (SSFs) play a strong role in sustaining millions of livelihoods, food security, nutrition, and income globally but the fishers engaged in this sector simultaneously experience high levels of vulnerability and processes of marginalisation. Several factors are attributed to the multidimensional vulnerabilities the small-scale fishers experience, spanning both natural (e.g., natural disasters, ecosystem change) and anthropogenic (e.g., policy change, hydrological interventions, aquaculture) pressures. While there is much literature on various natural and human drivers of vulnerability in small-scale fishery communities, an absence of research connecting vulnerability with water quality is evident. Fisher communities often talk about fish in relation to the health of their aquatic habitats wherein water quality is seen as a key parameter. The link between healthy fish and good quality water has significant implications for strong and viable fishing communities. This paper examines these links further by focusing on the nature of vulnerabilities caused by water quality changes in the small-scale fishery system of Chilika Lagoon in India. We undertake detailed analysis of the invasive shrimp aquaculture activities and hydrological interventions for opening of a lagoon inlet with the Bay of Bengal as two dominant drivers adversely impacting water quality and increasing vulnerabilities of the entire small-scale fisheries social-ecological system. Our analysis suggests that there are strong interconnections between changes in water quality and the levels of vulnerabilities in the SSFs of Chilika Lagoon. Pollutants such as pesticides, and organic compounds accumulate in fish tissues and affect their growth, reproduction, and overall health. This led to declines in fish populations, making it more difficult for fishers to make a living. In addition to direct impacts on fish populations, poor water quality also has indirect effects on the social and economic vulnerability of SSFs. For example, contamination of water sources led to the reduced number of fish species reducing the amount of time fishers can spend on fishing activities. This also affected the marketability of fish products, reduced income and increased poverty. To fully understand the interconnections between water quality and vulnerability in SSFs in Chilika Lagoon, it is important to consider both environmental and social factors, as well as the complex feedback loops between these factors. The study helps in bridging a crucial gap in our understanding of the role of water quality in vulnerability analysis within resource dependent communities. We conclude with key insights on possible coping responses and adaptive capacity necessary for the small-scale fisheries communities to transition toward viability.},

abstract={Coastal Livelihood Sustainability Analysis (CLSA) concept is one form of SES (Social Ecological System) framework. CLSA is developed from the coastal and ocean resource management framework, where social structures are always linked to ecological or natural systems. The purpose of this research is to analyze the interaction or connectivity of the functional systematic relationship. This is based on humans always utilizing the ecological services of a functional system relationship. This CLSA approach is a systematic approach that is influenced by temporal spatial aspects. The interaction results of social and ecological systems can be seen from the existence of assets (human made capital), which is an aspect of the material resources used by humans to carry out activities. There are several types of human made capital, which are described as physical, human, economic and social assets. All these assets are necessary to achieve the objectives of resource sustainability. The sustainability of the livelihood management of migrant fishing communities, which have high livelihood vulnerabilities. The sustainability of livelihoods is supported by five major livelihood sources that will be enabled to develop life as a capital asset. The main sources of livelihood are the assets or natural capital, human capital, financial capital, physical capital and social capital. The success of sustainable livelihood is strongly influenced by the condition of all capitals that is how value of service flowing from stock of capital owned. CLSA in this research is the identification to livelihood assets of migrant fishermen at origin and destination area in migration activity. There are different condition between destination and an origin area of migration. This research can be improved of capital assets. By knowing the status of resources and capital assets of livelihood at Tanjung Luar and Salura, it can be determined alternative livelihoods. Alternative livelihoods can be created in order to improve the welfare of coastal communities. The method in this research is a survey research method. The analysis conducted is quantitative descriptive analysis using the CLSA framework of Emertoon. Stages and steps in the data analysis were to assess the status and owned of livelihood assets, that consists are natural resources assets, human assets, economic assets, social assets, and also physical assets. The result of this research is determined that Salura Island as a destination area only has the high of natural resources assets. This means that the main livelihood assets of the Salura Island are natural resources assets. Usually the assets of resources, human, financial, physical and social assets are mostly better in the destination area of migration, but the results of the research have determined that different with concept of migration. The result also shows that Salura Island as a migration destination with higher asset resource existence can be used as a source of livelihood by squid migrant fish to continue the sustainability of livelihood.},

To address this issue, we applied the participatory scenario planning framework to the protected area of the Do ana social-ecological system in southwestern Spain. This work explores the social perceptions regarding the conditions, trends, trade-offs, and future of ecosystem services and human well-being, and seeks management strategies for the Do ana social-ecological system and its protected areas. We found that participatory scenario planning (1) can create different visions of the future of the system addressing its uncertainty and the main ecosystem services trade-offs, and (2) can propose consensual management strategies to determine a path toward a desirable future.},

abstract={This paper presents results from the MayaSim model, an integrated agent-based, cellular automata, and network model representing the ancient Maya social-ecological system. The model represents the relationship between population growth, agricultural production, soil degradation, climate variability, primary productivity, hydrology, ecosystem services, forest succession, and the stability of trade networks. Agents representing settlements develop and expand within a spatial landscape that changes under climate variation and responds to anthropogenic impacts. The model is able to reproduce spatial patterns and timelines somewhat analogous to that of the ancient Maya, although this proof-of-concept model requires refinement and further archaeological data for calibration. This paper aims to identify candidate features of a resilient versus vulnerable social-ecological system, and employs computer simulation to explore this topic, using the ancient Maya as an example. Complex systems modelling identifies how interconnected variables behave, considering fast-moving variables such as land cover change and trade connections, meso-speed variables such as demographics and climate variability, as well as slow-moving variables such as soil degradation.},

abstract={The Ostrom social-ecological system (SES) framework offers an interdisciplinary tool for studies of linked human-natural systems. However, its origin in the social sciences belies the effectiveness of its interdisciplinary ambitions and undermines its ability to cope with ecological complexity. To narrow the gap between inherently dynamic ecological systems and the SES framework, we need to explicitly recognize that SES outcomes are coproduced by social systems in which choices are made, as well as an ecological system with a diverse assortment of dynamic natural processes that mediate the effect of those choices. We illustrate the need for more explicit incorporation of ecological attributes into the SES framework by presenting a case study of a community-managed forest in Indiana, USA. A preliminary set of ecological attributes are also proposed for inclusion in the SES framework with the aim of spurring interest in further development of a truly interdisciplinary framework for the study of SESs.},

journal={LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING},
year={2015},
volume={136},
number={NA},
pages={130-143},
month={APR},
abstract={This research seeks to answer the question, what factors of the urban social-ecological system predict survival and growth of trees in nonprofit and neighborhood tree-planting projects? The Ostrom social-ecological system framework and Clark and colleagues' model of urban forest sustainability inform our selection of variables in four categories in the social-ecological system; these categories are the trees, the biophysical environment, the community, and management institutions. We use tree inventory methods to collect data on the survival, growth, and the social-ecological growing environment of recently-planted street trees in Indianapolis, IN to answer our research question. We use a probit model to predict tree survival, and a linear regression model to predict tree growth rate. The following variables are positively related to tree success (survival and/or growth): ball-and-burlap or container packaging, a visible root flare, good overall condition rating, the size of the tree-planting project, planting area width, median household income, percent of renter occupied homes, resident tenure, prior tree planting experience, correct mulching, and a collective watering strategy. The following variables are negatively related to tree success: caliper at planting, crown dieback, and lower trunk damage. Additional variables measured have less clear connections to tree success and should be examined further. Given that models including variables from all four categories of the social-ecological system generally outperform models that exclude some components, we recommend that future research on urban tree survival and growth should consider the holistic social-ecological systems context of the urban ecosystem.

abstract={Recognition of multiple knowledge systems is essential to facilitate collaboration and mutual learning between different actors, integration across social and ecological systems, and sustainable development goals. This study aims to identify how local knowledge from the indigenous people in developing countries contributes toward supporting the social-ecological system. We use a case study of the Ammatoa community, one of the indigenous communities in South Sulawesi Province, Indonesia. This study shows how their social and ecological practices are combined to develop their customary area and how the Ammatoa's customary values contribute towards achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 15 and 12 of the United Nations, i.e., leveraging local resources for livelihood and ensuring sustainable consumption and production patterns. Examples of practices elaborated in this paper are protecting, restoring, and promoting sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably managing forests, combating desertification, halting and reversing land degradation, halting biodiversity loss, and ensuring sustainable consumption and production patterns. Furthermore, the Ammatoa's customary values form a sustainable system that not only affects their social aspects, but also their economy and surrounding environment. This research can be used to develop relevant environmental-related interventions related to SDGs 15 and 12 from indigenous peoples' perspectives.},

abstract={This study proposes and empirically tests a framework that integrates the concepts of community resilience and social-ecological system (SES) resilience through community forestry case studies. The framework provides a possible approach for assessing community resilience based on the development and allocation of socio-cultural, economic, and natural capital of individual households within a given forest community. Furthermore, aspects of SES resilience and system dynamics are used to define the potential state thresholds of community resilience. This exploratory attempt to quantify community resilience, using the proposed framework, aims to advance understanding of the conceptual overlaps of SES and community resilience as applied to forestry management. We consider community forestry groups as SES examples in which the community is an important stakeholder in managing natural forest capital. We selected pioneer communities under the community-based forest management (CBFM) Program in the Philippines as our case studies. We found that, on average, CBFM group members demonstrated moderate levels of resilience according to their acquired levels of capital. Although economic capital remained the weakest capital, the CBFM program had a positive effect in increasing the socio-cultural and natural capital of an entire community.},

abstract={Against the backdrop of industrialization, urbanization, and the increasingly urgent issue of climate change, the latest round of collective forest tenure reform in China demonstrates the characteristics of institutional change and capital-biased technological progress. Using provincial panel data from 1994 to 2015, which is related to the main task of the reform, this study combined the Social-Ecological System (SES) framework to explore the impact of the latest round of collective forest tenure reform on forest carbon sequestration capacity. The study found that (1) the collective forest tenure reform enhances forest carbon sequestration capacity, especially in areas with abundant collective forests and clear property rights. Regional differences in per capita forestry income do not affect the reform's impact on this capacity; (2) the forest tenure reform affects carbon sequestration capacity by improving capital productivity, but labor productivity has no significant effect; (3) under the macro background, the interaction between forest tenure reform-supporting measures and factor productivity have a sustainable impact on carbon sequestration capacity. Therefore, deepening the collective forest tenure reform is an important measure for continuously improving the carbon sequestration capacity of collective forests.},

abstract={Leadership and social networks substantially influence the collective actions in rural communities. It is important to understand how village elites influence villagers through social networks and facilitate collective actions, especially for indigenous communities. This paper takes the rice terrace social-ecological system (SES) of the Hani ethnic minority in China as a case and adopts a mixed methodology to explore the diversified roles of various types of village elites in the collective actions of managing four social-ecological sub-systems: forests, villages, terraces, and water. Results reveal that institutional and non-institutional elites play different roles in coordinating the collective actions of managing four sub-systems. Social network analysis shows that village elites have high degree centrality and play bridging roles between different sub-groups, but differences exist between the network patterns of managing forests and water and managing villages and terraces. Contagion models show that both friendship and advice networks contribute to the social influence among villagers, but advice networks have larger influences in managing villages, terraces, and water than friendship networks. This study provides insights into the heterogeneity and dynamics of village leadership and social networks in managing rural SESs that are experiencing rapid socio-economic changes, and the results contribute to making integrative and adaptive planning and development policies for indigenous communities.},

journal={ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},

volume={17},

month={APR 1},
abstract={The spatial mapping of social-ecological system (SES) archetypes constitutes a fundamental tool to operationalize the SES concept in empirical research. Approaches to detect, map, and characterize SES archetypes have evolved over the last decade towards more integrative and comparable perspectives guided by SES conceptual frameworks and reference lists of variables. However, hardly any studies have investigated how to empirically identify the most relevant set of indicators to map the diversity of SESs. In this study, we propose a data-driven methodological routine based on multivariate statistical analysis to identify the most relevant indicators for mapping and characterizing SES archetypes in a particular region. Taking Andalusia (Spain) as a case study, we applied this methodological routine to 86 indicators representing multiple variables and dimensions of the SES. Additionally, we assessed how the empirical relevance of these indicators contributes to previous expert and empirical knowledge on key variables for characterizing SESs. We identified 29 key indicators that allowed us to map 15 SES archetypes encompassing natural, mosaic, agricultural, and urban systems, which uncovered contrasting land sharing and land sparing patterns throughout the territory. We found synergies but also disagreements between empirical and expert knowledge on the relevance of variables: agreement on their widespread relevance (32.7\% of the variables, e.g. crop and livestock production, net primary productivity, population density); relevance conditioned by the context or the scale (16.3\%, e.g. land protection, educational level); lack of agreement (20.4\%, e.g. economic level, land tenure); need of further assessments due to the lack of expert or empirical knowledge (30.6\%). Overall, our data-driven approach can contribute to more objective selection of relevant indicators for SES mapping, which may help to produce comparable and generalizable empirical knowledge on key variables for characterizing SESs, as well as to derive more representative descriptions and causal factor configurations in SES archetype analysis.},

abstract={A healthy park-people relationship depends essentially on the fair and sustainable maintenance of rural livelihood. When a protected area is designated, rural people may face restrictions on access to land and resource use. In Wuyishan of China, we analyzed the role of traditional tea cultivation during consistent protected area management to find ways to maintain the stability of this social-ecological system in the new national park era. Based on the social-ecological system meaning perception, we used an intensive social survey to investigate residents' perception of the ecosystem in terms of tea cultivation and its interaction with conservation policies. Results showed that tea cultivation brought major household income and was associated with multiple cultural services. Protected area management affected land use, and conservation outcomes were more obvious to farmers than economic and social ones. We argue that the multi-functionality of the forest-tea system has the potential to benefit both the local people and the public through conservation-compatible activities at three levels: to regulate biophysical elements in the land plot, to link production and market at the mountain level, and to secure tenure and encourage community participation at the landscape level. This knowledge co-production approach revealed that to avoid a negative park-people relationship, traditional knowledge and people's right to benefit must be respected.},

abstract={Monitoring the provision of multiple ecosystem services (ES) in social-ecological systems is a major challenge. Most tools usually tackle the problem by modelling individual ES, but do not perform a holistic analysis of a dynamic and integrated system. We developed a discrete-event model (DORIAN) and explored its potential for assessing biodiversity and multifunctionality of a mountain ski resort subjected to a changing climate. We represented this social-ecological system as a network comprising 16 binary components and 51 processes that define component interactions. We identified 22 economy- and ecology-related ES, depending on the presence/absence of components. We simulated six scenarios representing different economic, environmental and climatic situations and calculated a score (the sum of proxies for biodiversity or ES), corresponding to the level of biodiversity and multifunctionality. Results showed that climate change reduced the system's multifunctionality and increased the number of degraded states, as well as the trajectories from healthy to degraded states. With increasing levels of biodiversity, only ecology-related ES were boosted at low biodiversity levels, while both high levels of ecology- and economy-related ES were maintained at high biodiversity levels. This result demonstrates the importance of conserving high biodiversity in a social ecological system, for an optimal ``biodiversity - multifunctionality{''} win-win strategy.},

abstract={Against a background of intensifying climate-induced disturbances, the need to enhance the resilience of forests and forest management is gaining urgency. In forest management, multiple trade-offs exist between different demands as well as across and within temporal and spatial scales. However, methods to assess resilience that consider these trade-offs are presently lacking. Here we propose a hierarchical framework of principles, criteria, and indicators to assess the resilience of a social-ecological system by focusing on the mechanisms behind resilience. This hierarchical framework balances trade-offs between mechanisms, different parts of the social-ecological system, ecosystem services, and spatial as well as temporal scales. The framework was developed to be used in a participatory manner in forest management planning. It accounts for the major parts of the forest-related social-ecological system and considers the multiple trade-offs involved. We demonstrate the utility of the framework by applying it to a landscape dominated by Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) in Central Europe, managed for three different management goals. The framework highlights how forest resilience varies with the pursued management goals and related management strategies. The framework is flexible and can be applied to various forest management contexts as part of a participatory process with stakeholders. It thus is an important step towards operationalizing social-ecological resilience in forest management systems.},

abstract={We analysed the changes that had taken place in the last 45 years in the spatial structure of the landscape, in the demographic tendencies of the local population and in the socioeconomic structure, in order to describe the current state and possible evolution of the social-ecological system in a mountain rural landscape in northern Spain. We conducted a series of interviews-questionnaires with the local population, which enabled us to define their profile and to evaluate their perception of the landscape and changes therein, thus establishing trends of territorial development and integrating history, culture, technology and environmental parameters, under different management perspectives. We observed a change in the spatial configuration of the landscape and modification of the territory, associated with rural abandonment, all of which gives rise to tensions among the components of the social-ecological system. The recovery and continuity in time of this system would be more viable under certain patterns of adaptive management and with the active participation of the local population in the decision-taking process, aimed at maintaining the (historic) landscape, which is characterised by its persistence and presents acceptable levels of biological and spatial diversity and productivity. This landscape would, in turn, maintain the development of tourism, one of the current pillars of the local economy, as it creates great demand for rural, natural and cultural tourism.

abstract={This paper applies a social-ecological system (SES) framework to the analysis of a SES in the Taos valley of northern New Mexico. The SES analyzed is a set of interconnected irrigation communities known as acequias. These have persisted in the area for several hundred years. In this paper I combine concepts from multi-level governance, social network analysis, and interconnected action situations to diagnose the factors that have enabled the acequias to maintain the levels of cooperation needed to persist as farming communities in a high desert environment. To conduct this research, interview data were collected on-site to complement existing court testimonies and other relevant primary and secondary data. These data were analyzed via a step-wise diagnostic process that is inspired by the SES framework and used to illustrate how the acequias form a multilevel governance system via key network attributes, and how this governance structure maps onto the resource system while not overburdening the participants and providing sufficient benefits to motivate continued cooperation over time.},

abstract={Vulnerability is one of the prominent features of rural areas due to their distinctive characteristics, such as remoteness, geographical conditions, and socio-economic dependence on primary sectors. Addressing the vulnerability of rural areas in terms of the rural development paradigm is both urgent and relevant. This study aims to address this issue using the current state-of-the-art machine learning method, using the socio-ecological framework and integrated vulnerability index of villages in Lampung Province in Indonesia. The study attempts to predict and classify villages' vulnerability to be applied for better planning and rural development. Based on random forest classification and decision tree algorithm, the results show that the village governance system represented by rural water management and the level of education of village leaders are suitable prediction variables related to the low vulnerability index. This study can draw lessons learned to improve rural development in developing countries. (c) 2022 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada.},

abstract={We introduce a conceptual model of the urban forest patch as a complex social-ecological system, incorporating cross-scale interactions. We developed this model through an interdisciplinary process engaging social and ecological scientists and urban land management decision makers, with a focus on temperate forest social-ecological systems. In this paper, we place the production and management of urban forest patches in historical perspective, present a conceptual model of urban forest patches within a broader regional context, and identify a series of research questions to highlight future directions for research on urban forest patches. This conceptual model identifies how spatial and temporal social-ecological drivers interact with patch-level conditions at multiple scales. Our integrative approach can provide insights into the role of social-ecological drivers in shaping forest health, biodiversity, and benefits forest patches provide to people in urban and urbanizing regions, with direct implications for decision-making to improve management outcomes.},

abstract={Patrimony and resilience appear today as key concepts for understanding the dynamics of systems confronted with natural hazards. Nevertheless, the theoretical comparison between these concepts drawn from different epistemic approaches is lacking. Our aim is to interrelate resilience and patrimony concepts on the basis of a real example: the Agdal, a traditional forest management system in the Moroccan High Atlas. The role played by the Agdal in safeguarding the patterns of forest resource use by village communities from both external and internal conflicts, from natural hazards, and by securing a long-term supply of resource diversity is highlighted. This role shows the patrimonial character of the forest Agdal for the village communities and suggests an adaptive perspective. The patrimonial construction of the forest gives rise to management systems that allow a major place to experience social and environmental feedback, contributing to strengthened social-ecological system resilience and adaptability in the High Atlas Mountains. The notion of patrimony as a tool of resilience opens up a new interdisciplinary line of research.},

abstract={Resilience thinking has strongly influenced how people understand and pursue sustainability of linked social-ecological systems. Resilience thinking highlights the need to build capacity and manage general system properties in a complex, constantly changing world. I modified an analytical framework to address associations among cross-scale and cross-level dynamics, attributes of governance, and capacity to enhance resilience. The Danungdafu Forestation Area represents one of Taiwan's most controvisal cases concerning land use, indigenous rights, and environmental issues. Analysis of this Taiwanese experience from a social-ecological perspective can show how current capacities for managing resilience are related to critical governance attributes. Analysis helped identify fundamental flaws in current governance and key issues needing to be addressed. The Danungdafu Forestation Area should transition towards a governance regime that is more participatory, deliberative, multi-layered, accountable, just, and networked. This can be done by developing an intermediate level institution that coordinates the cross-scale and cross-level interactions that better fit this social-ecological system.},

abstract={A severe decline in ecosystem services (ES) has accompanied the rapid development of human societies. There is a growing interest in considering ES management from a systemic and integrated perspective. Yet, researchers still need to explore effective ways to integrate human and natural systems for strengthening ES. This study proposes an integrating framework that connects the concept of social-ecological system (SES) with ES. We utilize land use types as indicators of basic SES structure and employ the InVEST model to evaluate typical ES in the Jialing River Basin (JRB). By analyzing spatial and temporal characteristics of SES and multiple typical ES, we investigate how ES is related to different SES types. The results reveal that: (1) from 1980 to 2020, the SES of the JRB underwent significant transformations, including a decrease in cropland areas, while construction land and forestland areas increased. Especially, construction land SES experienced an increase as high as 212.53\%. (2) Regarding ES, water yield (WY) increased while soil conservation (SC), carbon storage (CS), and habitat quality (HQ) decreased. (3) The relationship analysis demonstrated disparities in levels of ES across various SES types. Construction land SES exhibited the highest average WY but lower SC, CS, and HQ values compared to forestland which had higher average SC, CS, and HQ instead. These findings imply that regional ES will be positively or negatively affected by transformation within SES. In the long run, it is crucial to synthesize both the characteristics of SES and functional benefits provided by ES in the JRB, then control the favorable transformations within SES to enhance a sustainable supply of ES. This study provides a novel methodology for connecting SES and ES comprehensively with new perspectives that will be beneficial for building regional SES management and ES enhancement.},

abstract={Carnivores across much of the world are declining, leading to loss of biodiversity as well as the ecosystem services carnivores provide. In 2020, the Alexander Archipelago (AA) wolf was petitioned for protection under the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA) for the third time in 30 years. Concerns included habitat alteration from industrial timber harvest and subsequent declines in prey (deer), human-caused mortality, climate change, and genetic inbreeding. However, the underlying biogeography and ecology of these wolves continues to suggest resiliency across the subspecies' range, even though local populations may go extinct. If local wolf populations go extinct, it will result in loss of their ecosystem services (e.g., interactions of wolves with their prey, which prevents over-browsing and protects carbon sequestration in soils and trees), which will likely have major consequences for the local social-ecological system. Here, we updated a model we constructed for the last ESA listing process (2015) to examine the dynamics of wolf and deer populations on Prince of Wales Island (the primary geographic focus of all three petitions) in response to future environmental and management scenarios developed with stakeholders. Further, we considered how changes in deer abundance impact predation services (prevention of over-browsing by deer). We found that wolf populations generally persisted over 30 years, but dropped below an effective population size of 50 wolves in 10-98\% of years simulated. Low wolf abundance resulted in higher deer abundance, which increased hunting opportunity, but also browsing damages (e.g., 19\% of areas would be over-browsed if wolf harvest caps are removed, and >30\% of areas would be over-browsed if wolves go extinct). Human harvest of wildlife was a key regulator of abundance and ecosystem services within the coastal rainforest social-ecological system; wolf abundance was most affected by wolf harvest regulations; and deer harvest restrictions increased wolf and deer abundances, but also greatly increased browsing impacts (>70\% of areas heavily browsed if hunting ceased). Our findings support an integrated approach to management of this social-ecological system, such that social and ecological sciences are both used to monitor important components of the system (e.g., measuring public sentiment and likelihood of poaching, alongside wolf and deer numbers). Integration and adaptive approaches are needed to ensure that the many ecosystem services humans depend on are valued, conserved, and restored, including the cryptic predation services wolves have historically provided to the timber industry via reduced browsing pressure by deer.},

abstract={Ecosystem services (ESs) provide a bridge between social systems and ecosystems. Effective management of the trade-offs between ecosystem services is an important scientific problem in the study of social-ecological system management. According to the origin of ESs trade-offs, this study summarizes the management approaches of ES trade-off, and points out the shortcomings of the existing management approaches in terms of ``efficiency{''} and ``fairness{''}. Finally, according to the shortcomings, an ES trade-off management framework is proposed to improve the ``efficiency{''} and ``fairness{''} of ES trade-off management. The research shows that the ES trade-off management framework based on key ecosystem services (KESs) can improve the supply of the KESs, and promote the inevitable loss on the non-key ESs (NKESs) so as to improve the ``efficiency{''} of ES trade-off management. At the same time, the framework constructs compensation scheme of private winners to private losers is constructed to improve the ``fairness{''} of ES trade-off management. The results provide potential solutions for ecosystem service trade-off management.},

abstract={Many actors, from the individual to neighborhood to municipal scale, influence the management of trees, grass, and other vegetation on residential properties. Recent work has been directed toward understanding the ecological characteristics of residential landscapes and the human drivers of landscape management; however, much of this work remains disciplinarily focused and at a single scale of analysis. This study employs a mixed-method approach to examine household- and neighborhood-scale drivers of urban residential tree species richness and tree canopy structure. A stratified sampling design was used to capture households in homeowners associations (HOAs) and neighborhood associations (NAs) to better understand the informal and formal institutions having an impact on residential tree management practices. We used the social-ecological system (SES) framework to build a classification system for identifying significant variables that influence residential tree composition and cover. Results of this work demonstrated tree species richness and canopy cover to be positively related to tree abundance and housing age, which is suggestive of the legacy effect. Governance variables were more strongly correlated with tree species richness whereas variables reflecting socioeconomic status and education were more strongly correlated with canopy cover. Rule compliance and fitting in with neighborhood landscaping norms was significantly more important to HOA households than NA households. Conversely, opportunities to work together to solve community problems were viewed more positively by NA households than HOA households. For all parcels together, compliance with city and HOA/NA rules was negatively related to tree species richness and canopy cover, a finding that may implicate the nature of rules that focus on tree removal practices and barriers to plant (what and where). This work is timely given the rapid expansion of neighborhood associations in urban areas, which parallels establishment of rules governing residential yard practices. If current arboriculture and urban forestry standards are considered during rule formation and implementation, such rules have the potential to promote species diversity and the sustained provisioning of ecosystem services.},

abstract={We studied how the failure to take into account gendered roles in the management of a communal pasture can affect the resilience of this social-ecological system. Data were collected using qualitative methods, including focus group discussions, in-depth interviews, and participant observations from one community in the highlands of Ethiopia. The results show that women are excluded from the informal institution that defines the access and use rules which guide the management of the communal pasture. Consequently, women's knowledge, preferences, and needs are not taken into account. This negatively affects the resilience of the communal pasture in two ways. Firstly, the exclusion of women's knowledge leads to future adaptation options being overlooked. Secondly, as a result of the failure to address women's needs, they start to question the legitimacy of the informal institution. The case study thus shows how excluding women, i.e., side-lining their knowledge and needs, weakens social learning and the adaptiveness of the management rules. Being blind to gender-related issues may thus undermine the resilience of a social-ecological system.},

abstract={Hard-bodied ticks have become a major concern in temperate regions because they transmit a variety of pathogens of medical significance. Ticks and pathogens interact with hosts in a complex social-ecological system (SES) that influences human exposure to tick-borne diseases (TBD). We argue that addressing the urgent public health threat posed by TBD requires an understanding of the integrated processes in the forest ecosystem that influence tick density and infection prevalence, transmission among ticks, animal hosts, and ultimately disease prevalence in humans. We argue that collaborative modeling of the human-tick SES is required to understand the system dynamics as well as move science toward policy action. Recent studies in human health have shown the importance of stakeholder participation in understanding the factors that contribute to human exposure to zoonotic diseases. We discuss how collaborative modeling can be applied to understand the impacts of forest management practices on ticks and TBD. We discuss the potential of collaborative modeling for encouraging participation of diverse stakeholders in discussing the implications of managing forest ticks in the absence of large-scale control policy.},

year={2011},
volume={16},

pages={NA},
month={NA},
abstract={Protected areas are increasingly being recognized as coupled social-ecological systems, whose effectiveness depends on their resilience. Here I present a historical profile of an individual case study, the New Forest (England), which was first designated as a protected area more than 900 years ago. Uniquely, a traditional pattern of land use has been maintained ever since, providing a rare opportunity to examine the resilience of an integrated social-ecological system over nine centuries. The New Forest demonstrates that over the long term, coupled social-ecological systems can be resilient to major internal and external shocks, including climate change, mass human mortality and war. Changes in governance had the greatest impact on the reserve itself, with two major crises identified in the mid-19th and 20th centuries. Resolution of these crises depended on the formation of alliances between local people and external partners, including the general public, a process that was supported by improvements in visitor access. Over a timescale of centuries, this social-ecological system has been highly dynamic in disturbance regimes but relatively stable in land use patterns. However, the factors underpinning resilience have changed over time. This case study suggests that for protected areas to be effective over the long term, social structures and institutions as well as environmental processes require adaptive capacity.},

abstract={The concept of resilience has been widely used in the study of social-ecological systems, with its key components identified as resistance, latitude, and precariousness. We use this concept to examine the differences among three semi-arid regions in terms of these three components. We do this by examining the status of tortoises that occur in the dry spiny forest Madagascar, the Karoo of South Africa, and the Mojave Desert of the United States as an indicator of the health and resilience of their respective ecosystems. Our findings demonstrate the tight coupling between societal development and ecosystem dynamics, the role of diversity in enhancing resilience, and the significance of local communal knowledge in sustaining it. Our findings also suggest that at each of the three sites, social parameters are the dominant drivers of change in the overall social-ecological system. We borrow the notions of control parameter and collective variable from dynamical systems theory to hypothesize that in present-day societies, social parameters might in fact be the control parameters of the greater social-ecological system, and that resilience is the collective variable that captures and demonstrates the overall behavior of the system.},

abstract={The implications of cumulative land-use decisions and shifting climate on forests, require us to integrate our understanding of ecosystems, markets, policy, and resource management into a social-ecological system. Humans play a central role in macrosystem dynamics, which complicates ecological theories that do not explicitly include human interactions. These dynamics also impact ecological services and related markets, which challenges economic theory. Here, we use two forest macroscale management initiatives to develop a theoretical understanding of how management interacts with ecological functions and services at these scales and how the multiple large-scale management goals work either in consort or conflict with other forest functions and services. We suggest that calling upon theories developed for organismal ecology, ecosystem ecology, and ecological economics adds to our understanding of social-ecological macrosystems. To initiate progress, we propose future research questions to add rigor to macrosystem-scale studies: (1) What are the ecosystem functions that operate at macroscales, their necessary structural components, and how do we observe them? (2) How do systems at one scale respond if altered at another scale? (3) How do we both effectively measure these components and interactions, and communicate that information in a meaningful manner for policy and management across different scales?},

abstract={Community forestry (CF) is one of the major forest management modalities in the world. A growing body of literature documents various outcomes and interactions of people with CF, but limited studies have assessed the mode of forest-people interaction considering changing socio-economic and environmental contexts by employing a broader theoretical framework. Our study employed Ostrom's social-ecological system (SES) framework accompanied by a meta-synthesis of peer-reviewed literature (n = 74), review of policy documents and census reports (n = 28), interviews with four stakeholder groups (n = 47) and group discussions with district-level forest user groups (n = 20), to explore the changed context in Nepal's mid-hills since 1990 s. The study revealed transformational changes in socio-economic and environmental contexts of Nepal's mid-hills compared to the conditions in which the CF was developed during 1990 s. Changes in the forces (or factors) of SES, including demography, socio-economic development, government policy and environmental discourse are so pronounced that its feedback to the social-ecological system is discernible. For example, the evolving dynamics have changed the mode of forest-people interaction and their relationship by altering land use practices, resource use patterns, farm-forestry linkage, and pool of human resources, which is reflected in diminishing participation, social capital, collective action, and (voluntary) contribution to CF management. Such (emerging) dynamics in the social-ecological system could further jeopardise CF institutions and their deliberation, weaken the forest-food security nexus, augment leadership gaps in forest management, and impede the country's efforts in achieving global climate and development goals. To revitalize CF in this changing context, we suggest that community forests should be managed in three different models: urban, protection and production by putting payment of ecosystem services in place. As Nepal is a global leader in CF and its policies are informing forest and land use policies around the world, the outcomes of our study could offer an insight to the decision-makers of other countries for recalibrating land use policies by considering evolving local and global dynamics and their feedback to SES.},

abstract={The protected area approach has extended from conserving biodiversity to improving human well- being. However, the relationship between conservation and socioeconomic and cultural development continues to be controversial. This paper combines land use variables with socioeconomic and cultural variables through multivariate ordination analysis and evaluates their evolution in two areas inside and outside a Biosphere Reserve since the approval of the Governance Plan for Use and Management in the Reserve. The results indicate a similar tendency in the two areas, from the abandonment of traditional rural activities and decline in pine plantations to naturalness, urban sprawl and the growth of the tertiary economic sector, welfare indicators and sustainability index. However, it can be broadly observed that the region included inside the protected area presents better conservation features (native forest) and rural systems (forestry and primary economic sector) than the region outside the protected area while maintaining similar socioeconomic and cultural conditions. We suggest that the designation of the Biosphere Reserve does not influence the local population negatively but does safeguard its conservation, which could have enhanced socioeconomic and cultural development. Thus, even though certain changes must be made to replace the conifer plantations and encourage agricultural activities, the designation of the protected area fulfills its sustainability goal and enhances the local population's quality of life.

month={OCT},
abstract={In the Pamir Mountains of Eastern Tajikistan, the clearance of mountain forests to provide fuelwood for an increasing population is a major source of environmental degradation. International development organisations have implemented joint forestry management institutions to help restore once-forested mountainous regions, but the success of these institutions has been highly variable. This study uses a multi-method approach, drawing on institutional analysis supported by Elinor Ostrom's design principles and social-ecological system framework in combination with resilience thinking to help understand why some communities in Tajikistan manage their forests more sustainably than others. The application of the design principles provided helpful guidance for practitioners implementing joint forestry management. The social-ecological system analysis revealed both `history of use' and `tenant density' as positively associated with forest condition. However, we also identify limitations of snapshot social-ecological assessments. In particular, we illustrate the critical importance of considering historical legacy effects, such as externally imposed centralised governance regimes (that characterise many post-Soviet states) in attempts to understand current management practices. Our work shows how a more nuanced understanding of institutional change and inertia can be achieved by adopting a resilience approach to institutional analysis, focusing on the importance of reorganisation. Lessons learned from our analysis should be widely applicable to common pool resource management in other semi-arid forested landscapes as well as in regions with a strong centralised governance legacy.},

month={SEP},
abstract={The Mayans of the Yucatan Peninsula, together with their environment, conform social-ecological systems with adaptation and resilience to natural, political and economic disturbances. In this study, we use the framework of social-ecological systems for describing a mechanism that allows a Mayan community and its natural environment to respond to disturbances over time. We describe (1) the activities that members of the community develop as part of their strategy for managing natural resource management, and (2) the history of the social-ecological system focusing on meaningful events: changes in their institutional body, landscape and/or practices for exploiting natural resources, and interactions between these changes. Through both semi-structured and in-depth interviews, historical narratives and participant observation, we found that managers use the environmental heterogeneity to diversify the exploitation of species, manage the secondary vegetation and protect mature vegetation. Formal and informal institutions of access, regulation and administration of natural resources regulate productive activities and management practices. These institutions operate differentially at the levels of environmental units (prohibition of the exploitation of the natural resources of mature tropical forests) and species (protection of the jaguar and cougar). Diversification of productive activities, management of environmental heterogeneity and the presence of flexible institutions enable responses in the social-ecological systems that have the potential to contribute to its long-term maintenance. Comprehensive studies like this might help to understand adaptive capacity and social-ecological resilience.},

abstract={Galicia is a region situated in the northwest of the Iberian Peninsula where community forests are very much spread. This kind of ownership is held by local communities that, collectively, decide how to manage the forest and its mycological resources as part of its non-timber forest products. In this work, we characterize and analyse the existing governance modalities for the collective use of mycological resources in both their material and immaterial aspects, and we do it by applying a social-ecological system framework combined with a knowledge economy model. Up to 21 mycological use initiatives have been identified and inventoried. Most of them manage the common resource through mycological reserves (open or closed), but there are others that produce and sell mushrooms. The work shows how communities use their governance mechanisms to define rules aimed at improving sustainability and the influx of revenues. In addition, we analyse how some of these initiatives are starting to manage their common immaterial resources (associated with values such as quality and with eco-certifications, etc.), and to develop innovative strategies (short supply chains) for the purpose of improving their position in the value chain. The text discusses community management as a strategy that allows combining sustainability objectives in the management of mycological resources with the raising of revenues in the long term. Finally, we underline the need for public policies that support successful experiences and strengthen the capacity of community institutions to appropriate the value they generate.},

abstract={The targets of ecosystem restoration have gradually transformed from a narrow focus on single or a few ecosystem services to a compound mode focusing on ecological, social and economic benefits. The socialecological system provides an integrative perspective to promote this transformation by reestablishing the relation between human and natural systems. Over the past 30 years, several ecological restoration projects have been implemented in the Dongting Lake basin to reverse ecological deterioration and improve agricultural production. This paper investigates the spatio-temporal dynamics of social-ecological changes in the Dongting Lake basin based on land use/cover and NDVI change trends. Results showed that the large-scale ecological restoration projects did not evidently increase the area of forest and grass in the basin, however, NDVI showed a significant growth trend. The social-ecological changes and its relevance to ecological restoration were also identified. From 2000 to 2015, water retention had the largest increment (95.70\%), followed by soil conservation (25.90\%), whereas carbon sequestration decreased slightly (-1.49\%). At the same time, the economy and agriculture in the basin also developed. Although the ecological restoration projects had promoted the overall socio-economic development and ecosystem restoration in Dongting Lake basin, their distribution and influence were disequilibrium within the basin. It seemed difficult for most counties to achieve rapid socio-economic development and improve ecosystem services at the same time. The benefit evaluation of ecological restoration projects based on social-ecological system can help to build on and reinforce existing restoration initiatives, and promote the sharing of experiences and good practices in ecosystem conservation and restoration practices.},

abstract={Currently more than 600 million of the 800 million people in SSA are without electricity, and it is estimated that an additional 2500 GW of power is required by 2030. Although the woody-biomass market in the developed world is relatively mature, only four woody-biomass plants in SSA have been established, all of which were closed by 2013. With its affordable labour, favourable climate and well-established forestry and agricultural sectors, South Africa appears to have the potential for a successful woody-biomass industry. This paper documents a first attempt at analysing why these plants failed. It aims to contextualisethe potential role of a sustainable woody-biomass sector in South Africa, through firstly developing a SES-based analytical framework and secondly, using this to undertake a retrospective resilience-based risk assessment of the four former woodybiomass pellet plants in order to identify strategies for increasing the resilience of the industry. The SES-based framework advances previous theory, which usually focuses on natural resources and their supply, by introducing a production process (with inputs and outputs), internal business dynamics and ecological variable interactions. The risk assessment can be used at a broad level to highlight important aspects which should be considered during feasibility assessments for new plants. Further work is proposed to focus on splitting the social-ecological system at different scales for further analysis, and to investigate the long-term ecological impacts of woody-biomass utilisation.},

abstract={This paper analyses prospects for ecosystem-based adaptation, through examining diverse forest-people interactions in Nepal's community forestry as a social-ecological system (SES). We examine the linkage between social-ecological resilience and societal adaptation in the Middle Hills of Nepal and, based on this, discuss the prospects of this system for climate adaptation. In doing so, we also discuss the prospects of community forestry for ecosystem-based adaptation in the rural agrarian context, focussing on a few attributes of resilience: diversity, modularity, and flexibility. We find that community forestry provides multiple pathways for both reactive and anticipatory adaptation, often reinforcing community resilience. Our finding also shows that, while ecological processes in community forestry (CF) are being managed by local institutions with an explicit goal to enhance the overall resilience of the SES, the underlying social and political dynamics of CF tend to be neglected in adaptation policy and planning. This prevents local organizations from harnessing the benefits of ecological resilience to enhance their adaptive capacity. The contribution of ecological resilience to societal adaptation has been constrained by large scale social and political drivers, especially bureaucratic structures underpinning the governance of forest in Nepal. Based on these findings, we recommend that ecosystem-based adaptation is fully informed by, and takes account of, local power dynamics. For instance, aligning governance and decision-making with the needs of marginalized groups can increase the resilience and adaptive capacity of social-ecological systems.},

month={JAN 12},
abstract={In 2016, the French government adopted a law for biodiversity, setting an objective of protecting 55,000 hectares of mangroves. This objective is particularly important to French Guiana, which shelters almost 60\% of French mangrove ecosystems, and where mangroves occupy three quarters of the coastline. The coast of French Guiana is also where issues associated with demographic and economic dynamics concentrate. There is thus a need to plan for an economic development that is compatible with the objective of protecting mangrove ecosystems. Ecosystem services (ES) assessment can support such decision-making, informing on the costs and benefits associated with alternative mangrove conservation strategies. While the many services provided by mangrove ecosystems are well documented worldwide, the extent to which these can be encountered in the specific case of French Guiana is currently only very partially known. Relying on the Fuzzy cognitive mapping (FCM) approach, we collected and compared the perception of multiple and heterogeneous groups of stakeholders, of the functioning of the mangrove social-ecological system at the scale of French Guiana. Results, allow to identify mangroves ES and threats particularly influenced by the high sedimentary dynamism of the shoreline. This generates two distinct components of the mangrove social-ecological system: mud banks where ecosystem services are spatially and temporally unstable, and associated with perceived constraints for key coastal activities, and estuarine mangroves where the ecosystem services usually described in the literature on mangroves can be found. Disservices associated with mangrove ecosystems were also identified as a key interaction. This can inform the research needs that should support sustainable development trajectories, fully accounting for the protection of French Guianese mangrove ecosystems.},

journal={ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
year={2013},
volume={52},
number={4},
pages={877-893},
month={OCT},
abstract={In the 1980s, tropical forest-management principles underwent a shift toward approaches giving greater responsibilities to rural people. One argument for such a shift were the long-term relations established between rural people and their natural resources. In Madagascar, a new law was drawn up in 1996 (Gelose law), which sought to integrate rural people into forest management. A gap was observed between the changes foreseen by the projects implementing the Gelose law and the actual changes. In this article, we use the concept of the social-ecological system (SES) to analyze that gap. The differences existing between the planned changes set by the Gelose contract in the village of Ambatoloaka (northwest of Madagascar) and the practices observed in 2010 were conceptualized as a gap between two SESs. The first SES is the targeted one (i.e., a virtual one); it corresponds to the designed Gelose contract. The second SES is the observed one. It is characterized by the heterogeneity of forest users and uses, which have several impacts on forest management, and by very dynamic social and ecological systems. The observed SES has been reshaped contingent on the constraints and opportunities offered by the Gelose contract as well as on other ecological and social components. The consequences and opportunities that such an SES reshaping would offer to improve the implementation of the Gelose law are discussed. The main reasons explaining the gap between the two SESs are as follows: (1) the clash between static and homogeneous perceptions in the targeted SES and the dynamics and heterogeneity that characterize the observed SES; and (2) the focus on one specific use of forest ecosystems (i.e., charcoal-making) in the targeted SES. Forest management in the observed SES depends on several uses of forest ecosystems.},

title={Weighing values and risks of beloved invasive species: The case of the survivor tree and conflict management in urban green infrastructure},
journal={URBAN FORESTRY \& URBAN GREENING},
year={2019},
volume={40},
number={SI},
pages={44-52},
month={APR},
abstract={A critical aspect of urban green infrastructure management hinges on the treatment of native and invasive species. Invasive species are widely seen as a major threat, yet the context-specific values people have for some of these species pose challenges for their management. Here, we offer a case study of the 9/11 survivor tree, a Gallery pear (Pyres calleryana Decne.) that survived the terrorist attack on September 11, 2001 at the World Trade Center in New York City and has since become a symbol of resilience. That individual tree and its progeny are beloved and they are also characterized as invasive. As part of the longitudinal research of the US Forest Service Living Memorials Project, we report findings from semi-structured interviews conducted with eight stewards from six living memorial sites that have survivor trees and with five individuals who have expert knowledge of the survivor tree, its propagation and dissemination. We find that some people see the tree primarily as a heroic symbol of hope and resilience, others see it primarily a threat to personal property, safety, and to biodiversity, which overshadow its social value. We conclude that Gallery pears are associated with multiple, conflicting values, having the power to both unite and divide around issues of recovery and resilience in social and ecological spheres. Whereas managers and policy makers tend to have absolute views of invasive species as negative, living memorial stewards and others affected by tragedies have personal relationships that significantly influence their attitudes and practices toward a line of Gallery pears. We conclude that urban green infrastructure management might best be seen as a highly contingent and value-driven practice, and that understanding these social meanings may lead to better stewardship of the whole social-ecological system.},

journal={ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
year={2020},
volume={25},
number={1},
pages={NA},
month={MAR},
abstract={Landscapes are subject to ecological and socioeconomic forces of change that interact in complex ways. To cope with these changes, landscape planning of natural resource management integrates sociocultural, ecological, and economic considerations in an analytic and systemic way. In this regard, social-ecological system (SES) frameworks have been developed to help analyze key factors that drive the dynamics of such complex adaptive systems. For forests, multifunctional management, which also highlights the ecological and socioeconomic roles of forests for society, has become a central objective for several European countries (e.g., France, Italy, and Germany). However, further development of methods, tools, and conceptual approaches is needed to facilitate our understanding of the arrangements behind management practices that include complex human-environment interactions. This study adopts Ostrom's SES framework and Anderies' robustness framework to highlight how forestry institutions affect forest ecosystems, forest functions, and social arrangements. As an illustration, we apply both frameworks to the Quatre-Montagnes forest, located in the south-east of France, in which multifunctionality is a major objective of forest governance. We first apply the SES framework to construct an analysis of the Quatre-Montagnes forest, specifying the first-tier and second-tier variables. From this, we describe the importance of infrastructure-related variables in shaping the interactions between components of the SES. We then apply the robustness framework, developed by Anderies, because we believe this framework enables a better analysis of ecosystem functions for infrastructure governance than the SES framework, which provides a better descriptive capacity for the variables. We discuss insights, based on our infrastructure analysis, which can be used when establishing designs for efficient forest management with heavy infrastructure dependencies.},

journal={ECOLOGICAL COMPLEXITY},
year={2020},
volume={43},
number={NA},
pages={NA},
month={AUG},
abstract={Does the adoption of environment-oriented actions by individuals necessarily improve the state of an ecosystem in the most effective way? We address this question with the example of eutrophication in shallow lakes. When exposed to fertilizers, such lakes can undergo a critical transition called eutrophication, resulting in a loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services. We couple a generic model of eutrophication with a best-response model of human behaviour, where agents can choose to pollute the lake at a high level (defection) or at a low level (cooperation). It is known that feedbacks between the interacting lake pollution and human behaviour can give rise to complex dynamics with multiple stable states and oscillations. Here, we analyze the impact of all model parameters on the shape of the nullclines. S-shaped nullclines are a condition for complex dynamics to occur. Moreover, we find that agents decreasing their pollution discharge into the lake is not necessarily the most effective way to reduce the pollution level in the lake. This is due to coexisting counterintuitive stable equilibria where the lake is in a clear state despite a high level of pollution discharge. We analyze the complex dynamics of the system and describe in detail Hopf, saddle-node, homoclinic and Bogdanov-Takens bifurcations. The complex dynamics with potential multistability and counterintuitive equilibria suggests that generic management recommendations holding for every level of pollution and of cooperation are impossible. Apart from the direct perturbation of an ecological variable, we identify three ways a management strategy can influence the social-ecological system: it can change the location, the resilience and the existence of stable equilibria.},

abstract={Over the past few decades, social-ecological transformations have contributed to the restoration of numerous carnivores, presenting new challenges for human-wildlife coexistence. Evaluating and understanding human-wildlife interaction dynamics, particularly for conflict-prone species, is crucial for conservation and management strategies. Our study focuses on Asiatic Black Bear (Ursus thibetanus) in Western Yunnan, China, a region with favourable bear conditions and significant environmental changes due to conservation policies. This study employed a multifaceted approach to gather data on bear occurrences and human-bear conflicts. Utilising species distribution models, we predicted the potential bear habitat in 2000 and 2020. We proposed a methodology integrating bear habitat with human footprint to delineate the human-bear interface. Additionally, we evaluated the spatial-temporal variations in bear habitat and human-bear interface between 2000 and 2020. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to capture the perceptions of local communities regarding the bear population, human-bear interactions and conservation policies. Our findings indicated that the potential habitats of bears were strongly influenced by forest cover. We noticed improvements in bear habitat from 2000 to 2020, notwithstanding localised losses in specific areas. Most respondents attributed the increasing bear population to forest restoration and reduced human impact during this period. Notably, a significant proportion of respondents supported the conservation policies, previously participating in their formulation and implementation. Our analysis further revealed increases in the human-bear interface and human-bear interactions from 2000 to 2020. Remarkably, these changes did not significantly diminish local communities' endorsement of conservation policies. This resilience can be attributed to the net positive impacts of conservation policies on the livelihoods of these communities. Our study highlights the complexity and dynamic nature of human-wildlife interactions within the social-ecological system and provides new insights to facilitate sustainable conservation and management measures.Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog.

journal={ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
year={2023},
volume={28},
number={1},
pages={NA},
month={MAR},
abstract={Indigenous perspectives on forest management are grounded in traditional ecological knowledge (TEK), so that socioculture influences the ways Indigenous Peoples transform their landscapes. However, how socioculture structures Indigenous perspectives on forest management is unclear. Moreover, little is known about the influence of Indigenous landscape transformations on forest succession and floristic diversity. Here, we test hypotheses from biocultural and ecological theories suggesting that: (i) key social-ecological relationships with specific taxa structure Indigenous perspectives on forest management; (ii) such relationships guide sustainable management that generates resilient forest regrowth; and (iii) this management promotes floristic diversity by acting as an intermediate disturbance. We collected information about cosmology, occupation history and management among the Zo`e, in Brazilian Amazonia. We also carried out floristic inventories in old-growth forests and in old Zo`e swidden-fallow areas to analyze forest structure and alpha-and beta-diversity along a gradient of forest successional stages. We show that the Zo`e perspective on forest management is structured by an ethical principle involving a social-ecological relationship with different beings, especially the spider monkey (Ateles sp.). This relationship generates mobility among the Zo`e that allows forest regrowth in their fallow areas, so that in 28 years, forest basal area may equal that of old-growth forests. Also, Zo`e forest management has increased alpha-and beta-diversity by increasing species richness and diversity in intermediate secondary forests and promoting floristic turnover at the landscape-level. These results show that some aspects of Zo`e cosmology influence forest disturbance regimes that generate a sustainable social-ecological system, therefore being key for Zo`e well-being and local biodiversity conservation. We believe that Indigenous perspectives about forest management should be included in forest conservation efforts aimed at protecting Amazonian biocultural diversity, thus valuing TEK and engendering sustainable social-ecological systems.},

volume={14},

pages={121-133},
month={JAN},
abstract={In Morocco, sacred groves called marabouts constitute a dense network of wild-forest remnants of high ecological and cultural value but which are threatened by global change. In this study, we investigated the relationship between sacred natural site (SNS) structure and landscape dynamics in the traditional Mediterranean landscape of the Beni Arouss tribe in Northern Morocco. The total number of sacred sites considered was 101, with an average density of 3 SNSs per 10 km(2) and an average area of 2.73 ha per SNS covered with natural vegetation-mainly cork oak forests (Quercus suber), woodlands (Quercus coccifera, Olea europaea), and scrublands. Analysis of the vascular plants in these sacred groves showed that there were 73 natural species and 3 fruit species in total; the natural species belonged to four plant forms: 6 tree species, 10 liana species, 20 shrub species, and 37 herbaceous plant species. To investigate the relationships between sacred groves and landscape change, the territory was divided into 51 land-use clusters around rural settlements. Multivariate analysis permitted the identification of three types of clusters categorized according to social-ecological system (SES): forest (F), agro-forest (AF), and agriculture (A). The landscape dynamics over the period from 1986 to 2003 were investigated, and those dynamics were found to be dominated by the conversion of forest to agriculture, which resulted in the transformation of 25\% of the SESs from F-SESs and AF-SESs into A-SESs during the period considered. Statistical comparisons of plant forms in sacred groves belonging to stable SESs during the period 1986-2003 showed that tree richness and liana cover were higher in F-SESs than in A-SESs, shrub richness and cover were higher in AF-SESs than in A-SESs, but there were no plant forms differences between F-SESs and AF-SESs. We argue that SES transformation processes-as represented by spatial dynamics-involve a regression of sacred groves, such that the functional plant groups of sacred groves could be considered ecological indicators.},

title={The Navigate framework: How the ecosystem services and resilience concepts can help us navigate in the current crises},
journal={ECOSYSTEM SERVICES},
year={2023},
volume={64},
number={NA},
pages={NA},
month={DEC},
abstract={In the last decades, humanity has considerably altered the functioning of Earth, resulting in global and interrelated social, economic, and environmental crises. To address these crises, the concepts of ES and resilience look promising to understand the complexity of the social-ecological system (SES) and its dynamics. However, operational frameworks that bring together these two concepts are still lacking. We therefore propose the Navigate framework to guide the researchers and the managers in finding sustainable solutions, in other words safe and just strategies.This framework was built from a literature review, interviews with leading experts, and feedback from its implementation in a case study.The conceptual part of the Navigate framework illustrates the multiple interactions between nature and society, depicted by the ES, occurring at various scales. Following disturbances, the SES responds by either persisting, adapting or even transforming (i.e. three forms of resilience). The operational part of Navigate suggests six steps to follow in an iterative process: (1) define the system, (2) define the problem, the stakes and goals, (3) define the pathways, (4) assess the ES, (5) assess the resilience, and (6) design the action plan. The implementation of this framework to a case study demonstrated that together ES and resilience with a participatory process gave a comprehensive picture of the SES, essential to making sound sustainable decisions. Indeed, the integrated assessment of ES combining various complementary methods highlights the stakeholders' needs and perspectives, the various forms of knowledge, the scales, and the interactions. Resilience broadened the analysis by understanding how the important drivers impacted the SES and its ES.In conclusion, the Navigate framework shows the way (i.e. which ES the stakeholders have requested) while considering the dynamic properties of the SES, amidst increasing social and ecological uncertainties, to navigate together toward sustainability.},

abstract={Historical analogies can help us contextualize new technical developments with social, cultural, and political forces at work. The late Joseon Dynasty period of Korea (1639-1910), a closed economy with detailed written records, provides a rare opportunity to examine a social-ecological system (SES) responding to drivers of change over a long period of time. Based on historical records and reconstructed data, we aim to: (1) characterize how the expansion of human technology, Ondol (traditional underfloor heating system), affected different subsystems and their interactions within the SES over time, (2) examine the role of the government in promoting the technology and regulating its impacts, and (3) summarize the pertinent lessons learned from old Korea for governing a modern-day bioeconomy. Ondol allows various forest biomass to be utilized as household fuel, including fuelwood, forest litter, and grass scraped from forest floor. Continuous biomass harvesting over 250 years to feed Ondol contributed to forest degradation and the forest ecosystem condition trapped in the early successional stage in the Korean Peninsula. The ecological changes were exacerbated by the Pine Policy with a singular focus on reserving Korean red pine (Pinus densiflora Siebold and Zucc.) for government uses. The policy failed to recognize basic needs of the public while countenancing an expansion of Ondol and a cultural preference for heated floors that propagated an increased use of biomass fuel. This case illustrates the importance of recognizing potential technology traps where a human innovation opened opportunities for more resource use. The lessons learned from old Korea show that bioeconomy transitions would require multifaceted governance responses while being cautious about being too closely tied to the dominant national agenda. Environmental history has much to offer for understanding the social and ecological systemic risks of the current technical developments. We call for more historical analogs from different parts of the world to ``move forward by looking back{''},

The land tenures are strong and go up to the official recognition of private property. Any relaunch of the cocoa sector will take place in highly contested areas, and perhaps at the expense of the last remnants of natural formations with a major effect on gender division of labor and land appropriation.},

abstract={There are fundamental spatial and temporal disconnects between the specific policies that have been crafted to address our wildfire challenges. The biophysical changes in fuels, wildfire behavior, and climate have created a new set of conditions for which our wildfire governance system is poorly suited to address. To address these challenges, a reorientation of goals is needed to focus on creating an anticipatory wildfire governance system focused on social and ecological resilience. Key characteristics of this system could include the following: (1) not taking historical patterns as givens; (2) identifying future social and ecological thresholds of concern; (3) embracing diversity/heterogeneity as principles in ecological and social responses; and (4) incorporating learning among different scales of actors to create a scaffolded learning system.},

abstract={The aim of this work was to determine whether socioeconomic factors explain the importance of culturally salient plants to social-ecological systems. Extractive communities of the Araripe-Apodi Environmental Protection Area in Northeast Brazil were studied, and a random sample of the population was selected. Quantitative variables (education, age and income) were analyzed using Spearman correlations, while categorical variables (gender and occupation) were analyzed using Mann-Whitney tests. Relationships between socioeconomic factors and the importance of culturally salient plants were all weak. Nevertheless, age influenced the local importance of the largest number of species. Other factors not considered in this study (historical, cultural, ecological, and psychological) may be outstanding predictors of the importance of culturally salient plants and should be studied in future investigations.},

title={Understanding opportunities for urban forest expansion to inform goals: Working toward a virtuous cycle in New York City},
journal={FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE CITIES},
year={2022},
volume={4},

pages={NA},
month={NOV 23},
abstract={Urban forests are critical infrastructure for mitigating environmental and social challenges cities face. Municipalities and non-governmental entities, among others, often set goals (e.g., tree planting or canopy targets) to support urban forests and their benefits. We develop the conceptual underpinnings for an analysis of where additional canopy can fit within the landscape, while considering factors that influence where trees can be planted, and canopy can grow ({''}practical canopy{''}). We apply this in New York City (NYC) to inform the setting of a canopy goal by the NYC Urban Forest Task Force (UFTF) for the NYC Urban Forest Agenda, which may trigger a virtuous cycle, or a positive feedback loop where people are mobilized to protect the urban forest, and its benefits that ultimately motivate people to commit to its conservation. We further develop framing for a ``priority canopy{''} analysis to understand where urban forest expansion should be prioritized given more context (e.g., environmental hazards and local preferences), which can inform how expansion of the urban forest is achieved. We estimate an opportunity for 15,899 ha of new canopy in NYC given existing opportunities and constraints (practical canopy), which, if leveraged, could result in nearly doubling the canopy as of 2017 (17,253 ha). However, like existing canopy, practical canopy is not evenly distributed, in general, or across jurisdictions and land uses. Relying solely on areas identified as practical canopy to expand the urban forest would exacerbate these inequities. We discuss how the NYC UFTF established a visionary and achievable goal of at least 30\% canopy cover by 2035, informed by this analysis and guided by priorities of equity, health, and resilience. Achievement of this goal will ultimately require a combination of protecting and stewarding the existing resource, and leveraging opportunities for tree planting. Achieving a more equitable urban forest will also require identification of priority canopy, and, in cases, creation of new opportunities for tree planting and canopy expansion. Overall, the collaborative establishment of such goals based on local context can be instrumental in creating a virtuous cycle, moving conservation actors toward exercising influence and agency within the social-ecological system.},

abstract={Subsistence farmers in elephant rangelands suffer food insecurity, economic losses and emotional stress from crop damage by elephants, resulting in reduced local support toward elephant conservation. To foster human-elephant co-existence in a dynamic social-ecological system, we explored the validity of Classification Tree (CT) analysis application to identify human-elephant hotspots in an effort to target approaches to reduce human-elephant conflicts. The CT analysis revealed that the most important factors affecting occurrence of crop damage were crop types, field sizes and distance to nearest road and river. From CT generated thresholds, we propose establishment of multi-criteria-based risk zones, as an alternative approach, to quickly identify and prioritize future human-elephant conflict (HEC) hotspots for improved agrarian livelihood and elephant conservation outcomes. We also explained the limitations of CT models. This study contributes to the existing theory and body of work on elephant habitat use at the human-elephant interface.},

abstract={The role of community-based natural resources management in the form of ``greening{''} after large scale system shocks and surprises is argued to provide multiple benefits via engagement with living elements of social-ecological systems and subsequent enhanced resilience at multiple scales. The importance of so-called social-ecological symbols, especially the potent hybrid symbols of trees and their handling after a disaster is interrogated. The paper explores the notion of hybridity, and applies it to the hybrid symbol of the tree in postdisaster contexts. The paper briefly highlights three U.S. cases documenting the symbolic roles of trees in a context of significant shock to a social-ecological system: the terrorist attacks on New York City in 2001, the devastating hurricane that struck New Orleans in 2005, and the sudden tornadoes that wreaked havoc upon the small Midwestern city of Joplin, Missouri in 2011.},

abstract={The ``chestnut civilization{''} is often used to qualify agrarian inland Corsica. Based on a critical review of historical sources and research on present dynamics, we show how this ``civilization{''} has built up on a long series of resistance and adaptation to external political forces, from Genovese and French domination up to the present period of independence claims. The construction of the castagnetu, the Corsican chestnut (Castanea sativa mill.) forest, as a social-ecological system is based on a constantly evolving compromise between wild and domestic attributes, but also on socio-political resistance, incorporation, and innovation. We argue that the castagnetu's resilience, beyond its social-ecological qualities and its economic profitability, is closely linked to a constant incorporation of identity and cultural values into chestnut trees and gardens, but also to the role assigned to the castagnetu by its supporters in the political positioning of their relations to both central power and outside actors.},

abstract={Payment for ecosystem services (PES) is one of the most commonly used economic instruments developed for biological conservation. Evidence has shown the importance of the local context in PES design and implementation, and the complexity of defining and specifying this context. We developed a proposal to narrow the local context, using the social-ecological system's framework, through two case studies: San Antonio, an indigenous community in Oaxaca, Mexico, and El Ajusco, a community in the periphery of Mexico City. This chapter discusses ten variables drawn from a series of interviews to approach the local context. Four of these variables stand out because of their incidence on the way PES outcomes are perceived, and on the local context definition: opportunity costs, confidence and cooperation, internal organization, and the presence and experience of NGOs.},

abstract={This paper analyses the tragic 2009 wildfire of Horta de Sant Joan in Catalonia. The local environmental history, the changes in land use of the pre-fire forest landscape, and the clash between different social discourses after the wildfire reveal different sociopolitical forms of constructing the relationship between nature and society. Each social actor explains wildfire and forest management according to different time scales and interests. These discourses can be classified by the degree of inclusion or exclusion of fire in the social-ecological system. The contextualisation and analysis of the ``desired landscapes{''} proposed by the social actors allows for a deeper reflection on contested understandings and values in relation to forests and wildfires. We conclude by arguing in favour of a proper re-politicisation of the debate around the causes of and the responses to wildfires.},

abstract={Aboriginal peoples' respect for grizzly bear (Ursus arctos) is widely acknowledged, but rarely explored, in wildlife management discourse in northern Canada. Practices of respect expressed toward bears were observed and grouped into four categories: terminology, stories, reciprocity, and ritual. In the southwest Yukon, practices in all four categories form a coherent qualitative resource management system that may enhance the resilience of the bear-human system as a whole. This system also demonstrates the possibility of a previously unrecognized human role in maintaining productive riparian ecosystems and salmon runs, potentially providing a range of valued social-ecological outcomes. Practices of respect hold promise for new strategies to manage bear-human interactions, but such successful systems may be irreducibly small scale and place based.},

volume={505},

month={FEB 1},
abstract={The research examines the potential role of restoring cultural ecosystem services in sustainably and equitably managing forested landscapes. It looks at how facilitating enhanced usage of cultural ecosystem services may mobilize ecological identities - or one's identification as a responsible agent to a natural system. The study focuses on the village groves of Korea that were restored during the first phase of the village grove restoration program (2003-2015) led by Korea Forest Service (KFS). Questionnaire survey was used to collect data on village leaders' ecological identity values (EIV) and their perception of how village groves' different ecosystem services are being used by villagers and non-villagers. These data were complemented by KFS-published information regarding the village groves' social-ecological system factors. Government documents and independent evaluation reports were analyzed to understand specifically how the restoration program addressed the task of restoring cultural values. Relationship between EIV and ecosystem service usage levels were examined by linear regression analysis, while difference tests were conducted to infer whether or not select social-ecological factors exhibit distinct difference in EIV or in ecosystem service usage levels. While the analytical results are far from conclusive, they hint at certain directions: first, the restoration program is found to have treated village groves themselves to be embodiments of cultural values. This approach leaves a wide gap to effective revival or reinvention of specific cultural uses or values that users can associate with. Second, the regression analysis shows generally stronger influence on village leaders' EIV by cultural ecosystem service usage than by usage of other service types. Examining by subtypes of cultural ecosystem services, those that are villager-oriented compared to visitor-oriented show higher influence on EIV, as do those individually-used compared to collectively-used. Third, the difference tests show no conclusive results about social-ecological system factors, except to speculate that factors conducive to visitor-oriented uses are found associated with lower EIV in village leaders. Furthermore, tourism attraction presence shows not only association with lower EIV but also with generally lower usage of the village groves' varoius ecosystem services. Such findings that show distinctions between villager-oriented andvisitor-oriented services and uses of village groves call for deliberative balancing of possible trade-offs between benefits to different user groups. This seminal study calls for further research on ecological identities, cultural values and cultural ecosystem services as potentially useful approaches to achieve more sustainable and equitable outcomes in restoration and conservation efforts.},

abstract={Research and policy debates over natural resource management in developing countries have largely focused on identifying the set of institutions that best supports resource sustainability and poverty alleviation. We argue that beyond finding the right institutional fit for a social-ecological system, it is equally important to understand how context affects the design and outcomes of institutional reforms. We propose a refined conceptualisation of context, based on a revision of the Institutional Analysis and Development framework. We defend a systematic analysis of context, distinguishing between contextual factors affecting the fitness to local socio-ecological conditions and contextual factors that mobilise power such as political-economic interests and prevailing discourses. We illustrate our argument with empirical research on land-tenure reforms that have been implemented since the 1980s in northern Vietnam. The proposed analytical framework and conceptualisation of context allows a more pervasive understanding of contextual factors, enabling the incorporation of the forms of power that give meaning and legitimacy to institutional change.},

abstract={Wildfires in the Iberian Peninsula were large and frequent in the second half of the 20th century. Land use and land cover (LULC) also changed greatly. Our aim was to understand the relationship between LULC and fire in the western and eastern ends of the Iberian Central Mountain System. We compared two case study landscapes, the Estrela massif and the Ayllon massif, which are biophysically similar but with different social-ecological contexts. In both, fires were in general more likely in shrublands and pastures than in forests. Shrublands replaced forests after fires. Contrasting LULC in the two massifs, particularly pastures, likely explained the differences in fire occurrence, and reflected different regional land use policies and history. Fire here is a social-ecological system, influenced by specific LULC and with implications from landscape to regional scales. Understanding how LULC changes interact with fire is powerful for improving landscape and regional planning.},

abstract={Aquaculture, and shrimp aquaculture in particular, can have major social and environmental impacts. However, aquaculture remains an understudied area in commons research. Can aspects of commons theory be applied to solve problems of aquaculture? We examined three coastal community-based shrimp aquaculture operations in northwestern Sri Lanka using a case study approach. These shrimp farms were individually owned by small producers and managed under local-level rules designed by cooperatives (samithi). The common-pool resource of major interest was water for aquaculture ponds, obtained from an interconnected water body. We evaluated the shrimp farming social-ecological system by using Ostrom's design principles for collective action. Key elements of the system were: clearly defined boundaries; collaboratively designed crop calendar, bottom-up approach involving community associations, multi-level governance, and farmers-and-government collaborative structures. Together, these elements resolved the excludability and subtractability problems of commons by establishing boundary and membership rules and collective choice rules.},

title={Interlocking panarchies in multi-use boreal forests in Sweden},

year={2010},
volume={15},
number={3},
pages={NA},
month={NA},
abstract={This paper uses northern Sweden as a case study of a multi-use social-ecological system, in which forestry and reindeer husbandry interact as different land use forms in the same area. We aim to describe the timeline of main events that have influenced resource use in northern Sweden, that is, to attempt a historical profiling of the system, and to discuss these trends in the system in terms of adaptive cycles and resilience. The study shows that key political decisions have created strong path dependencies and a situation in which forestry today is characterized by low flexibility and low resilience due to the highly optimized harvesting of tree resources. Since forestry is the overwhelmingly strongest actor, trends in forestry from the mid-19th century forward are, to a large part, driving dynamics in reindeer husbandry and environmental protection, resulting in a system of interlocking panarchies with large implications for the competing land uses.},

abstract={Approach: This chapter presents fuzzy-logic cognitive mapping as a participatory method for modeling social-ecological systems. The overview of the method is discussed through its evolution, suitability for application in environmental modeling, and examples in environmental research. Participant Engagement: Fuzzy-logic cognitive mapping facilitates interactive stakeholder involvement throughout the entire modeling process, offering a possibility for discussion, negotiation, consensus building, and social learning. Models/Outcomes: Final outcomes are semi-quantitative models representing most significant components and their relationships within a social-ecological system. These can be used to increase understanding of a particular issue, analyze possible changes to the system, and project future scenarios, or serve as a communication or perception analysis tool. Challenges: The results of this semi-quantitative method can only be interpreted compared to other components in the model, and cannot be taken as absolute real-value outcomes. Also, to overcome possible biases, subjectivity, and difficulties in assigning weights to interconnections in the model, numerous stakeholders must be involved.},

abstract={Policies at multiple levels pronounce the need to encompass both social and ecological systems in governance and management of natural capital in terms of resources and ecosystems. One approach to knowledge production and learning about landscapes as social-ecological systems is to compare multiple case studies consisting of large spaces and places. We first review the landscape concepts' biophysical, anthropogenic, and intangible dimensions. Second, we exemplify how the different landscape concepts can be used to derive measurable variables for different sustainability indicators. Third, we review gradients in the three dimensions of the term landscape on the European continent, and propose to use them for the stratification of multiple case studies of social-ecological systems. We stress the benefits of the landscape concepts to measure sustainability, and how this can improve collaborative learning about development toward sustainability in social-ecological systems. Finally, analyses of multiple landscapes improve the understanding of context for governance and management.},

abstract={Despite striking global change, management to ensure healthy landscapes and sustained natural resources has tended to set objectives on the basis of the historical range of variability in stationary ecosystems. Many social-ecological systems are moving into novel conditions that can result in ecological transformation. We present four foundations to enable a transition to future-oriented conservation and management that increases capacity to manage change. The foundations are to identify plausible social-ecological trajectories, to apply upstream and deliberate engagement and decision-making with stakeholders, to formulate management pathways to desired futures, and to consider a portfolio approach to manage risk and account for multiple preferences across space and time. We use the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska as a case study to illustrate how the four foundations address common land management challenges for navigating transformation and deciding when, where, and how to resist, accept, or direct social-ecological change.},

abstract={In Cameroon, community forests are frequently presented as a relevant option to increase the welfare of rural populations and simultaneously improve local governance and forest resources conservation. But apart from community forests, rural livelihoods also depend on forest areas, designated as `domestic forests' in this article, where local users enjoy informal customary rights. The specific contributions of community and domestic forests to the evolution of the prevailing socio-ecological system are assessed through a diachronic study of a village which is located in southern Cameroon. The Sustainable Livelihoods Framework is used to compare the progress of this social-ecological system between January 2008 and December 2009. The overall evolution of livelihoods was found to be positive during that period. In this case study, domestic forests and community forests are based on complementary models, which are often observed in southern Cameroon. Domestic forests constitute the basis of socio-economic development, while community forests might offer opportunities for a local-level carbon sequestration payment mechanism.},

abstract={Although scholars of social-ecological resilience propose unity between humans and the natural world, much of this work remains based on Cartesian division of mind and body that denies it. We present an example of a unified system of resilience thinking shared with us by Anishinaabe (Ojibway) elders of Pikangikum First Nation, northwestern Ontario. The elders' views of boreal forest disturbance and renewal are distinct from western scientific approaches in their recognition of agency, the ability to individually express free will in nonhuman beings including animals, plants, rocks, and forest fire within their landscape. Pikangikum elders perceive that, if relationships based on respect, reciprocity, and noninterference are maintained with other agents, renewal will continue. The proposition of living landscapes composed of diverse nonhuman agents poses challenges to collaboration with western worldviews, which view nature largely as mechanistic and without moral standing. We suggest that a greater attention to nonwestern ontologies can contribute to productive cross-cultural partnerships directed toward fostering resilience.},

In the early 2000s, concerns over declining morel mushroom abundance in national parks in the greater Washington, DC, region (NCR) led to the creation of harvest limits and stimulated research on the social-ecological system of morels in that region. In this article we compare findings from research on morel harvesting conducted at two national parks in the NCR from 2004 to 2007, with fungal management from two federal units in the PNW. We find substantial differences in existing regulatory policies, historical and cultural harvesting practices, and taxonomic and ecological variation in Morchella, indicating the need for regionally specific management. To address these differences, we recommend a participatory approach incorporating the local social-ecological specificities of mushroom harvesting and ecology that are missed at coarser spatial and temporal scales.},

abstract={The positive social and environmental outcomes of involving local and indigenous people in environmental management have made their inclusion in forest management increasingly considered. However, in Malaysia, where indigenous forest-dependent communities, known as the Orang Asli, are not yet involved in forest management, their significance needs to be empirically recorded. This study aims to investigate the relevance of involving the Orang Asli in Malaysia's forest management. The study employed a participant observational study at Kampung Tanjung Rambai, an Orang Asli settlement located in the Malaysian state of Selangor. Dwelling with the community and engaging in their forest-based lives for a course of 1 month have managed to capture their current relationships with the forest, which were then analyzed to determine their roles as meaningful stakeholders. The results show that the community has maintained a relationship with their land that may ensure the prudent use of resources. Furthermore, their forest-based lives can be regarded as small-scale disturbances in the forest ecosystem, which are necessary for maintaining resilience.},

month={MAY},
abstract={We developed a mathematical model with two-way linked socio-ecological dynamics to study farmland abandonment and to understand the regimes shifts of this socio-ecological system. The model considers that migration is a collective behavior socio-economically driven and that the ecosystem is dynamic. The model identifies equilibria that vary from mass migration, farmland abandonment, and forest regeneration, to no migration and forest eradication; partial migration and/or coexistence of farmland and forest also constitute possible equilibria. Overall, the model reflects farmland abandonment processes observed in the field and illustrates the importance of the complex interlinked mechanisms between the social and ecological systems determining farmland abandonment, that are not evident when approached independently. The model dynamics show that the hysteresis on the social dynamics renders regimes shifts difficult to reverse, and that this difficulty is accentuated when considering the ecological system dynamic. Similar models could be applied to other socio-ecological systems to help their management.},

abstract={In the Amazonian rainforest, a new and pervasive spatial pattern has been created by road paving and the impacts of road paving usually extend from a small-scale region to an entire social-ecological system, making a multi-scale analysis imperative for thinking through structure, function, and dynamics of deforested landscapes. We propose a moving window approach to describe the deforestation impacts across multiple spatial scales and then illustrate this method with a deforestation example in an Amazon tri-national frontier, which provides an excellent tri-national deforestation and land change comparision for this work. The results indicate that the intensive fragmentation occurs locally, while a large part of the study area is still covered by forest. In addition, a smaller study was undertaken to further assess deforestation impacts, and we found that the cleared areas exhibit strong influences beyond the boundaries of itself. In this research, the landscape-based representation of deforestation dynamics and their impacts on the larger landscape provides important information for forest studies and could be included in future conservation programs.},

abstract={Mining companies are expected to return land to a stable, productive, and self-sustaining condition by rehabilitating degraded areas to also deliver social benefits, an essential dimension of sustainable land management. This research aimed to develop a framework for mine rehabilitation planning based on an integrated analysis of the social-ecological system provided by the ecosystem services concept to facilitate community engagement and the delivery of social benefits. An Ecosystem Services Assessment for Rehabilitation framework was tested at two bauxite mines undergoing ecological restoration. The mines are operated by the same company in two countries. Key results showed that the framework can help companies, regulators, and community members alike identify whether biophysical restoration efforts translate into key human benefits. Overall the framework provides a means for enhancing community engagement to explicitly address social benefits that, with a business as usual focus on ecological goals, may not be delivered. The ecosystem services concept provides a practical approach to link ecological and social outcomes of mine restoration.},

abstract={Ecological restoration is considered a nature-based solution to reduce ecosystem degradation, biodiversity loss, and combat climate change. In this sense, the objective of this study was to identify the knowledge management practices that are present in an ecological restoration process in the tropical dry forest. The empirical study was developed using a mixed approach over an area of 11,079 ha in Huila, Colombia. At first, the qualitative study was supported by a documentary review and participant observation between 2018 and 2020. On the other hand, the quantitative study was carried out through the application of the Delphi method with the participation of 64 experts. Twenty-two knowledge management practices were identified with orientation towards human factors, organization, information technologies, strategy, and intellectual protection. These findings show that all the knowledge management practices identified have an impact on the six components of the ecological restoration process (planning, diagnosis, implementation, monitoring, participation, and consolidation). Likewise, these practices contribute to the generation, transformation, and mobilization of local and scientific knowledge in the components of the ecological restoration process of the tropical dry forest.},

abstract={The presented contribution in its first part summarizes several important theoretical findings of the system ecology supporting non-equilibrium paradigm of complex adaptive systems. We emphasise the concept of non-equilibrium thermodynamics of living systems and the Honing's adaptive cycle of a social-ecological system. In natural forests, the phases of an adaptive cycle fit to a substantial extent also to stages and phases of a large and a small forest cycle, although there is a different terminology. Further, we have emphasised the natural role of disturbances and their explanation from the thermodynamic point of view - as an important component of an adaptive cycle, which supports conclusions that these natural phenomena not only participated in the evolution of the whole habitats, but from the long-term view, they may even increase the resilience and overall ecological stability of ecosystems. Finally, we have tried to apply the findings of the theories presented to derive or underlie several principles of the management of temperate deciduous and mixed natural forests, which we consider important.},

abstract={Understanding the regime shifts of Social-Ecological Systems (SES) and their local effects and driving factors over a long period of time is significant for future sustainability. We provide a perspective on the processes unfolding over time in order to identify the regime shifts of an SES based on changes in the relationships between the SES components. In addition, we investigate their driving factors and local effects. The applicability of this approach is demonstrated by analyzing the evolution of the SES in Guizhou Province, China, over the past 600 years. Six evolutionary phases are identified: the slow expansion of cultivation, the rapid expansion of cultivation, the continuous expansion of cultivation, the slower expansion of cultivation, the transformation of ecological protection driven by returning farmland to forest, and green development driven by urbanization. Our study establishes the empirical relationship between the state (phase) of the SES and its driving factors and effects. This study on the evolution, driving factors, and effects of the SES in Guizhou Province, China, provides an important reference for long-term regional planning and policy making.},

abstract={Understanding social-ecological system dynamics is a major research priority for sustainable management of landscapes, ecosystems and resources. But the lack of multi-decadal records represents an important gap in information that hinders the development of the research agenda. Without improved information on the long-term and complex interactions between causal factors and responses, it will be difficult to answer key questions about trends, rates of change, tipping points, safe operating spaces and pre-impact conditions. Where available long-term monitored records are too short or lacking, palaeoenvironmental sciences may provide continuous multi-decadal records for an array of ecosystem states, processes and services. Combining these records with conventional sources of historical information from instrumental monitoring records, official statistics and enumerations, remote sensing, archival documents, cartography and archaeology produces an evolutionary framework for reconstructing integrated regional histories. We demonstrate the integrated approach with published case studies from Australia, China, Europe and North America.},

abstract={Spatially explicit information has become a de-facto standard for the analysis of natural systems. However, social science is much slower to pick up this approach, and with a few exceptions, governance structures are analysed out of the spatial contexts, despite spatial fit issues being recognised as central to the study of environmental institutions. Another problem arising from the limited use/low awareness of spatial analysis tools is that studies of social-ecological systems are rarely done consistently for a large area; instead they tend to rely on case studies that are often chosen for their idiosyncrasies. As a result, our knowledge of social-ecological systems is somewhat distorted. This study provides an account of quantitative and qualitative spatially-explicit analyses of a resource governance system, and in doing so offers a methodology for integrating biophysical and institutional dimensions of a social-ecological system in the evaluation of its adaptability. The focus is on forest systems, the scale is a nation (Belarus) and the unit of analysis is a square kilometre forest patch. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The multiple effects of ecosystem restoration programmes deserve attention. After reviewing the social-ecological effects of 23 ecosystem restoration programs in Asia's drylands, we find that these programmes mainly contribute to sustainable development goals (SDGs) synergistically, but the trade-offs between social-ecological effects still exist. Among the five goals of SDG15 (Life on Land), SDG13 (Climate Action), SDG6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), SDG1 (No poverty), and SDG2 (Zero Hunger), 11 programs can synergistically achieve no less than three goals, especially grassland restoration and water diversion in China, as well as water management programmes in Israel. However, the contribution of ecosystem restoration programs to SDG15 easily weakens SDG6, SDG1, and SDG2, indicating the competition of land and water between ecosystem restoration and agriculture. To reduce the trade-offs among SGDs caused by ecosystem restoration, we propose the social-ecological system research framework of `Dryland Boundary - Water, Food, Energy and Ecosystem Nexus - Meta-coupling - Nature-based Solutions' to guide the implementation of ecosystem restoration programmes from four aspects: supply-demand matching, element matching, regional matching, and local adaptation.},

abstract={This study investigates the historical development of the southwest coastal region of Bangladesh through the lens of human-delta co-evolutionary system. The change process of social and hydro-ecological systems is described based on the drivers-pressure-state-impact-response (DPSIR) framework. The multiple physical and socio-economic drivers such as climatic change, upstream development, geologic process, land use change-affected river flow, salinity, water logging and cyclones are creating adverse impacts on ecology (e.g. mangrove forest) and society (e.g. population migration). Existing management practices such as the Coastal Embankment project (CEP) also created adverse impacts on social-ecological system. In addition to the geology of this region that plays the major role in the delta development process, human interventions such as large coastal development projects have intervened the land formation processes. The trends and impacts of these changes along the coast unfold the necessity of integrated management approach such as Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) and Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM). Comprehensive understanding of social and hydro-ecological system in southwest coastal region through DPSIR approach presented in this study can provide effective solution for implementing ongoing management strategies.},

abstract={Subsistence harvesting and wild food production by Athabascan peoples is part of an integrated social-ecological system of interior Alaska. We describe effects of recent trends and future climate change projections on the boreal ecosystem of interior Alaska and relate changes in ecosystem services to Athabascan subsistence. We focus primarily on moose, a keystone terrestrial subsistence resource of villages in that region. Although recent climate change has affected the boreal forest, moose, and Athabascan moose harvesting, a high dependence by village households on moose persists. An historical account of 20th century socioeconomic changes demonstrates that the vulnerability of Athabascan subsistence systems to climatic change has in some respects increased while at the same time has improved aspects of village resilience. In the face of future climate and socioeconomic changes, communities have limited but potentially effective mitigation and adaptation opportunities. The extent to which residents can realize those opportunities depends on the responsiveness of formal and informal institutions to local needs. For example, increases in Alaska's urban population coupled with climate-induced habitat shifts may increase hunting conflicts in low-moose years. This problem could be mitigated through adaptive co-management strategies that project future moose densities and redirect urban hunters to areas of lower conflict.},

abstract={Fevers of unknown origin complicate treatment and prevention of infectious diseases and are a global health burden. We examined risk factors of self-reported fever-categorized as ``malarial{''} and ``nonmalarial{''}-in households adjacent to national parks across the Ugandan Albertine Rift, a biodiversity and emerging infectious disease hotspot. Statistical models fitted to these data suggest that perceived nonmalarial fevers of unknown origin were associated with more frequent direct contact with wildlife and with increased distance from parks where wildlife habitat is limited to small forest fragments. Perceived malarial fevers were associated with close proximity to parks but were not associated with direct wildlife contact. Self-reported fevers of any kind were not associated with livestock ownership. These results suggest a hypothesis that nonmalarial fevers in this area are associated with wildlife contact, and further investigation of zoonoses from wildlife is warranted. More generally, our findings of land use-disease relationships aid in hypothesis development for future research in this social-ecological system where emerging infectious diseases specifically, and rural public health provisioning generally, are important issues.},

journal={JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},

volume={351},

pages={NA},
month={FEB},
abstract={Wildland fire incident commanders make wildfire response decisions within an increasingly complex socioenvironmental context. Threats to human safety and property, along with public pressures and agency cultures, often lead commanders to emphasize full suppression. However, commanders may use less-than-full suppression to enhance responder safety, reduce firefighting costs, and encourage beneficial effects of fire. This study asks: what management, socioeconomic, environmental, and fire behavior characteristics are associated with full suppression and the less-than-full suppression methods of point-zone protection, confinement/ containment, and maintain/monitor? We analyzed incident report data from 374 wildfires in the United States northern Rocky Mountains between 2008 and 2013. Regression models showed that full suppression was most strongly associated with higher housing density and earlier dates in the calendar year, along with non-federal land jurisdiction, regional and national incident management teams, human-caused ignitions, low fire-growth potential, and greater fire size. Interviews with commanders provided decision-making context for these regression results. Future efforts to encourage less-than-full suppression should address the complex management context, in addition to the biophysical context, of fire response.},

abstract={Sustainable use of common-pool resources such as fish, water or forests depends on the cooperation of resource users that restrain their individual extraction to socially optimal levels. Empirical evidence has shown that under certain social and biophysical conditions, self-organized cooperation in the commons can evolve. Global change, however, may drastically alter these conditions. We assess the robustness of cooperation to environmental variability in a stylized model of a community that harvests a shared resource. Community members follow a norm of socially optimal resource extraction, which is enforced through social sanctioning. Our results indicate that both resource abundance and a small increase in resource variability can lead to collapse of cooperation observed in the no-variability case, while either scarcity or large variability have the potential to stabilize it. The combined effects of changes in amount and variability can reinforce or counteract each other depending on their size and the initial level of cooperation in the community. If two socially separate groups are ecologically connected through resource leakage, cooperation in one can destabilize the other. These findings provide insights into possible effects of global change and spatial connectivity, indicating that there is no simple answer as to their effects on cooperation and sustainable resource use.},

abstract={Fire-prone landscapes are not well studied as coupled human and natural systems (CHANS) and present many challenges for understanding and promoting adaptive behaviors and institutions. Here, we explore how heterogeneity, feedbacks, and external drivers in this type of natural hazard system can lead to complexity and can limit the development of more adaptive approaches to policy and management. Institutions and social networks can counter these limitations and promote adaptation. We also develop a conceptual model that includes a robust characterization of social subsystems for a fire-prone landscape in Oregon and describe how we are building an agent-based model to promote understanding of this social-ecological system. Our agent-based model, which incorporates existing ecological models of vegetation and fire and is based on empirical studies of landowner decision-making, will be used to explore alternative management and fire scenarios with land managers and various public entities. We expect that the development of CHANS frameworks and the application of a simulation model in a collaborative setting will facilitate the development of more effective policies and practices for fire-prone landscapes.},

abstract={The Earth's population will become more than 80\% urban during this century. This threshold is often regarded as sufficient justification for pursuing urban ecology. However, pursuit has primarily focused on building empirical richness, and urban ecology theory is rarely discussed. The Baltimore Ecosystem Study (BES) has been grounded in theory since its inception and its two decades of data collection have stimulated progress toward comprehensive urban theory. Emerging urban ecology theory integrates biology, physical sciences, social sciences, and urban design, probes interdisciplinary frontiers while being founded on textbook disciplinary theories, and accommodates surprising empirical results. Theoretical growth in urban ecology has relied on refined frameworks, increased disciplinary scope, and longevity of interdisciplinary interactions. We describe the theories used by BES initially, and trace ongoing theoretical development that increasingly reflects the hybrid biological-physical-social nature of the Baltimore ecosystem. The specific mix of theories used in Baltimore likely will require modification when applied to other urban areas, but the developmental process, and the key results, will continue to benefit other urban social-ecological research projects.},

abstract={Research on the governance of social-ecological systems often emphasizes the need for self-organized, flexible and adaptive arrangements to deal with uncertainty, abrupt change and surprises that are characteristic of social-ecological systems. However, adaptive governance as well as transitions toward alternative forms of governance are embedded in politics and it is often the political processes that determine change and stability in governance systems and policy. This paper analyses five established theoretical frameworks of the policy process originating in political science and public policy research with respect to their potential to enhance understanding of governance and complex policy dynamics in social-ecological systems. The frameworks are found to be divergent in their conceptualization of policy change (focusing on incremental or large-scale, major changes), highlighting different aspects of bounded rationality in their model of individual behavior and focusing their attention on different aspects of the policy process (role of information, attention, beliefs, institutional structure, particular actors, etc.). We discuss the application of these frameworks and their potential contribution, to unravelling the political dimension in adaptive governance and transformations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

year={2018},
volume={10},

month={JAN},
abstract={There are different technological approaches to deal with the social-ecological adversities found in the Brazilian Semiarid region (BSA). They vary according to the interpretation of what the roots of these adversities and the causes of the resulting vulnerability are. This paper analyses two technological approaches to the BSA, the first provided by the government through public policies and the other driven by civil society. It focuses on the initiatives promoted by each approach during the 20th and 21st centuries, and discusses how they have enhanced or reduced the sustainability of the Brazilian Semiarid region. This assessment is based on document analysis, fieldwork and open/semi-structured interviews. The traditional technological approach did not reduce the social-ecological vulnerability of the BSA system or increase resilience of family farmers and of the deciduous forest, the most vulnerable parties. It has boosted development from a classical development perspective, promoting macro-infrastructure and growth, but also contributed to keep the same pattern of dependence of farmers. Social technologies have been promoting the BSA sustainability and can have a long-lasting impact if extensively applied. While the traditional approach mostly benefits large landowners, social technologies benefit family farmers, the deciduous forest and the entire social-ecological system.},

abstract={Shade-grown coffee is an important reservoir for tropical biodiversity, but habitat quality hinges on decisions made by farmers. Our research aims to investigate the link between coffee producers' decisions and outcomes for biodiversity, using epiphytes as our focal group. Using qualitative methods, we interviewed 33 producers in northern Nicaragua to understand how they connect trees and epiphytes on their farms to ecosystem services and how personal values, access to agronomic expertise, labor supply, and financial stability influence decision-making. We used interview responses to construct six producer typologies. Most producers had strong positive attitudes toward trees and associated them with a variety of important ecosystem services. Smallholders were more likely to connect trees with provisioning services, while producers on larger farms and with greater agronomic knowledge emphasized regulating services. Most producers connected epiphytes primarily with aesthetic values. Across demographics, producers emphasized the restorative potential for shade coffee in repairing damage to soil, water, and nutrient cycles caused by other forms of agriculture. The conservation significance and sustainability of this social-ecological system can be maintained and expanded through economic and capacity-building conservation interventions, especially when those can be connected to values already held by farmers.},

abstract={Social-ecological transitions in the silvopastoral system of San Isidro, Rosario, Batangas, Philippines were analyzed using land cover trends and community perceptions. A combination of remote sensing processing, randomized survey, and participatory approaches were conducted. Four of six land cover categories (forests/ orchards, grasslands, crop.fields and water bodies) were identified to be sources of ecosystem services in the landscape which are essentialfor cattle farming. In 2000, the landscape became an on-fbrin research site on cattlefarming. Coupled with other social factors such as land privatization and infrastructure development, this has reshaped land cover changes over time. In response, cattle farming dynamics, especially during critical dry periods, have adapted through measures such as switching to greater supplementation of commercialfeeds. Despite social-ecological transitions, the cattlebased silvopastoral system in the landscape has persisted by exhibiting key principles of resilience such as diversity, connectivity, andfeedback management. However, concerns on Arther impacts ofkey issues (e.g., landprivatization) should be addressed to sustain the cattle-based silvopastoral system in the landscape. This study provides critical insights on how natural resource management by communities andpolicies by decision makers should carefully consider their potential impacts in sustaining locally important ecosystem services in the face of rapidly transitioning social-ecological systems.},

abstract={We investigate the role of culture in sustaining essential ecosystem services in the arid and erratic climate of an agropastoral landscape in southern Madagascar. Our fieldwork and interviews in Ambovombe subprefecture in Androy addressed land use, agropastoralism, livelihood, institutions and their moral basis. Our analysis points to the interdependence of cultural practices and ecosystem services: sacred forests, crop pollination, subsistence farming, cattle economy and societal transition and purification rituals. We posit a social-ancestral contract that works as a moral attractor structuring and sustaining the agropastoral ecosystem services system. The contract between living and nonliving clan members underpins the cultural practices and rituals that regulate the vulnerable agropastoral system. We conclude that the well-being values of the inhabitants of the south of Madagascar depend upon moralities that lend legitimacy and stability to the management of the social-ecological processes that precondition ecosystem services production. Neither ecosystem nor culture delivers ecosystem services to society. Ecosystem services are generated by an interdependent social-ecological system in which knowledge, practice, and beliefs coevolve: culture is a key factor in their generation and persistence. The study suggests these are significant interdependences to consider in dynamic analyses of ecosystem service production. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={We investigate the perceptions and impacts of climate change on 11 Indigenous communities in Northern British Columbia and Southeast Alaska. This coastal region constitutes an extremely dynamic and resilient social-ecological system where Indigenous Peoples have been adjusting to changing climate and biodiversity for millennia. The region is a bellwether for biodiversity changes in coastal, forest, and montane environments that link the arctic to more southerly latitudes on the Pacific coast. Ninety-six Elders and resource users were interviewed to record Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) and observations regarding weather, landscape, and resource changes, especially as concerns what we term Cultural Keystone Indicator Species (CKIS), which provide a unique lens into the effects of environmental change. Our findings show that Indigenous residents of these communities are aware of significant environmental changes over their lifetimes, and an acceleration in changes over the last 15-20 years, not only in weather patterns, but also in the behaviour, distributions, and availability of important plants and animals. Within a broader ecological and social context of dwelling, we suggest ways this knowledge can assist communities in responding to future environmental changes using a range of place-based adaptation modes.},

abstract={The human impact on nature has now reached a level at which the well-being of future human society is at risk. Therefore, transformative change in society is needed. Environmental assessments contribute to shaping environmental policy, potentially leveraging transformative change. Red Lists are a key information source on the state of biodiversity. Our aim was to study the Red List authors' perceptions of how Red Lists contribute to leveraging sustainability changes. We interviewed 15 of the authors of the forest and peatland sections of the Finnish Red List of Ecosystems 2018. We used the framework of sustainability leverage points to locate sustainability changes that Red Lists have leveraged in the social part of the Finnish social-ecological system. Our results show how the assessors perceived the influence of the Red Lists at most of the leverage points, including the deepest ones, and how these influences simultaneously co-exist in several leverage points. The most prominent sustainability changes were linked with legislation and information flows, whereas current paradigms, system goals and legislation appeared to prevent Red Lists from leveraging sustainability changes in Finland. We conclude that the production and dissemination processes of Red List knowledge can make an important contribution to sustainability changes.},

abstract={An integrated approach to understanding ecosystem service values in Wyoming and Montana, USA is presented. The assessment encompasses a major river basin, and includes a synthesis of existing data and research related to the natural system and separate data collection efforts regarding the social and economic importance of ecosystem services. A holistic look at the social-ecological system provides nuanced information about ecosystem service values and tradeoffs for the purpose of public land decision-making. The initial ecological assessment concluded that water resources were particularly vulnerable, which guided the social and economic assessments. The social assessment applied Q-methodology, ultimately identifying and exploring four archetypes regarding views on the importance of 34 ecosystem services, which were dubbed ``environmental{''}, ``agricultural{''}, ``Native American{''}, and ``recreation{''}. The economic assessment applied choice modeling to understand non-market values of ecosystem services (i.e., agricultural community, aquatic biodiversity, river angling, and motorized winter recreation), and latent class analysis provided insight into preference heterogeneity previously indicated in the social assessment. The structured approach can inform natural resource decision-making by including several different perspectives, integrating multiple spatial scales, highlighting particular ecosystem services as relevant within the context of many ecosystem services, and facilitating relations between the public and natural resource stewards.},

volume={74},

pages={6-17},
month={DEC},
abstract={Mangrove forests are ecologically important and carbon-rich coastal ecosystems that provide direct and indirect livelihood support for coastal communities. In recent years there has been increased discussion in the policy and scientific communities over how to include mangrove forests in climate change mitigation initiatives such as REDD+. There are a number of challenges to establishing a successful REDD+ project in mangrove areas, with land tenure and stakeholder entitlements arguably the most challenging. This study examines how REDD+ approaches might be applied to better balance timber production and conservation objectives in the Matang Mangrove Forest Reserve (MMFR), a 40,466 ha mangrove forest area in Malaysia. Stakeholder profiles and needs are linked with ecosystem services to develop an integrated profile of this complex social-ecological system, which has been managed for timber production for more than 100 years, and has recently revealed evidence of declining ecosystem health. The results provide insights into how REDD+ might be operationalised in existing forest areas with traditions of multiple uses, potentially contributing to improved social-ecological outcomes for forests and their diverse stakeholders.

abstract={Conflicts between humans and Asiatic black bears (Ursus thibetanus) are widespread in Asia and pose challenges to human-bear coexistence. Identifying effective mitigation measures requires a thorough understanding of human-bear conflicts (HBC). We assessed spatial-temporal patterns of HBC and their impact factors around the Baoshan Section of the Gaoligongshan Nature Reserve (GNNR) between 2012 and 2020. The results suggested that crop raiding by bears occurred most commonly, followed by beehive loss, livestock depredation, and human casualties. HBC hotspots occurred near the protected area where local people frequently encountered bears. The landscapes with lower elevation and human density were at higher risk of HBC. Furthermore, villages with more fragmented forests or less fragmented croplands were more vulnerable to HBC. The differences in agricultural structures contributed to the diverse composition of HBC between the two regions. In addition, crop raiding by bears decreased significantly, probably due to the changing landscape composition and configuration derived from human behaviors, yet livestock depredation and beehive loss increased. Our findings indicated the complex interrelationship between the environment, bears, and humans, which could guide the implementation of mitigation measures. We recommend multiple approaches based on a social-ecological system to mitigate HBC.},

abstract={Human and ecological elements of resource management systems co-adapt over time. In this paper, we examine the drivers of change in forest management policy in British Columbia since 1850. We asked: How has a set of system attributes changed over time, and what drivers contributed to change when it occurred? We simultaneously examined a set of three propositions relating to drivers and dynamics of policy change. We find that factors contributing to the level of impacts, like technology, changed substantially over time and had dramatic impacts. In partial contrast, the institutions used to exercise control (patterns of agency and governance) remained the same until relatively recently. Other system attributes remained unchanged (e.g., the concept of ecosystems as stable entities that humans can manage and control). Substantive, decision-relevant uncertainties characterized all periods of management but did not act as a barrier to the adoption of new regimes at any time. Against this backdrop of constancy in some attributes, and change in others, a few exogenous drivers (e.g., technology, war, markets, legal decisions, ideas, and climate) triggered episodic reexamination of guidelines for resource management. The implications of these findings for future policy change in this system are discussed.},

abstract={In this article we extend the theory of community prediction by presenting seven hypotheses for predicting community structure in a directionally changing world. The first three address well-studied community responses to environmental and ecological change: ecological communities are most likely to exhibit threshold changes in structure when perturbations cause large changes in limiting soil or sediment resources, dominant or keystone species, or attributes of disturbance regime that influence community recruitment. Four additional hypotheses address social-ecological interactions and apply to both ecological communities and social-ecological systems. Human responsiveness to short-term and local costs and benefits often leads to human actions with unintended long-term impacts, particularly those that are far from the site of decision making or are geographically dispersed. Policies are usually based on past conditions of ecosystem services rather than expected future trends. Finally, institutions that strengthen negative feedbacks between human actions and social-ecological consequences can reduce human impacts through more responsive (and thus more effective) management of public ecosystem services. Because of the large role that humans play in modifying ecosystems and ecosystem services, it is particularly important to test and improve social-ecological hypotheses as a basis for shaping appropriate policies for long-term ecosystem resilience.},

abstract={Protected areas (PAs) are critical for achieving conservation, economic and development goals, but the factors that lead households to engage in prohibited resource collection in PAs are not well understood. We examine collection behaviours in community forests and the protected Chitwan National Park in Chitwan, Nepal. Our approach incorporates household and ecological data, including structured interviews, spatially explicit data on collection behaviours measured with computer tablets and a systematic field survey of invasive species. We pair our data with a framework that considers factors related to a household's demand for resources, barriers to prohibited resource collection, barriers to legal resource collection and alternatives to resource collection. The analysis identifies key drivers of prohibited collection, including sociodemographic variables and perceptions of an invasive plant (Mikania micrantha). The social-ecological systems approach reveals that household perceptions of the presence of M. micrantha were more strongly associated with resource collection decisions than the actual ecologically measured presence of the plant. We explore the policy implications of our findings for PAs and propose that employing a social-ecological systems approach leads to conservation policy and scientific insights that are not possible to achieve with social or ecological approaches alone.},

abstract={Understand the effects of context-specific conditions on incentives, social interactions, and the likelihood of local organization is critical in supporting the sustainable management of collective tropical forests. In this vein, this study sought to analyze the causal relationships between factors in the context of the central rainforest of the Colombian Pacific that create barriers to local communities' cooperation in commercial logging management and control. The Socio-ecological Systems Analysis Framework was used and fed with information from a literature review and 24 interviews conducted with key informants in the area. We found that the mechanisms formally established for administering and managing collective forests have failed to encourage user cooperation and have ineffective control of free access to the increasingly scarce forest resource. We were able to identify and explain the causal importance of seven local context variables concerning the generation of disincentives to cooperation. The variables were: forest area extent, representative mechanisms in place, formulation and relevance of resource use and management regulations, appropriation by local institutions, timber trade intermediaries, low socioeconomic development, and multilevel forest management hierarchies. The results of this study hope also to help identify more effective strategies to directly involve local communities and engage them in the management and control of collective tropical forests.},

journal={ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},

volume={64},
number={NA},
pages={83-92},
month={OCT},
abstract={Forest restoration is the counterforce to deforestation. In many parts of the world it mitigates forest loss and degradation, but success rates vary. Socio-political variables are important predictors of effectiveness of restoration activities, indicating that restoration strategies need to be locally adapted. Yet, contextual assessments of the biophysical, social and political characteristics of forest restoration are rare. Here, we integrate a social-ecological systems framework with systematic decision-making to inform forest restoration planning. We illustrate this approach through a prioritization analysis in a community-based forest restoration context in Paser District, East Kalimantan, Indonesia. We compare the solutions of our integrated framework with those identified on the basis of biophysical criteria alone. We discover that incorporating a socio-political context alters the selection of priority areas. While the social feasibility and political permissibility can be enhanced, ecological benefits are likely to be reduced and/or opportunity costs of alternative land uses are to be increased. Our conceptual framework allows the appraisal of potential trade-offs between social and ecological outcomes of alternative options, and has the potential to evaluate the efficiency of existing policies. Empirical testing in a range of contexts is required to ensure broad applicability and transferability of our conceptual framework. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={We explored how the forest-dwelling Soliga community of South India views and explains biological invasions, and how local knowledge can inform scientific knowledge on biological invasions. We used an interview schedule with open-ended questions to solicit Soliga opinion on Lantana camara (lantana) invasion. The Soliga cited three reasons for lantana spread: its prolific fruit output and wide seed dispersal, change in fire management, and historical extraction of grass and bamboo. The Soliga believe that lantana invasion has had negative effects on the ecosystem and their livelihoods. Tabling scientific knowledge with local knowledge has improved our understanding of lantana invasion. The role of existing lantana in colonizing neighboring areas, and the response of native tree communities to lantana were common to both local and scientific sources. However, the Soliga view provides a more nuanced perspective of the lantana-fire relationship (contextually based on lantana density) with fires suppressing lantana when lantana density was low. This is contrary to views held by foresters and biologists, that fires are uniformly detrimental and promote lantana. Our study shows that examining Soliga observations has improved understanding of the invasion process and presents avenues for future lantana management.},

abstract={Our review highlights how traditional ecological knowledge influences people's adaptive capacity to social-ecological change and identifies a set of mechanisms that contribute to such capacity in the context of community-based biodiversity conservation initiatives. Twenty-three publications, including twenty-nine case studies, were reviewed with the aim of investigating how local knowledge, community-based conservation, and resilience interrelate in social-ecological systems. We highlight that such relationships have not been systematically addressed in regions where a great number of community conservation initiatives are found; and we identify a set of factors that foster people's adaptive capacity to social-ecological change and a number of social processes that, in contrast, undermine such capacity and the overall resilience of the social-ecological system. We suggest that there is a need to further investigate how climate variability and other events affect the joint evolution of conservation outcomes and traditional ecological knowledge, and there is a need to expand the current focus on social factors to explain changes in traditional ecological knowledge and adaptive capacity towards a broader approach that pays attention to ecosystem dynamics and environmental change.},

month={FEB},
abstract={We argue that purely deficit-based perspectives regarding urban social-ecological systems (SES) and the human populations within them represent barriers to these systems' ability to move from undesirable system states into more desirable, sustainable ones. We characterize issues such as individual ecological identity, human exemptionalism, anthropocentrism, and resource dependence. We examine notions found in the resource dependency literature, where we trace the roots of ideas about dependency. We use this literature as a spring board into the possibilities of an antipodal notion of resource dependency potentially applicable in urban contexts, what we call positive dependency. Next we describe two possible sources of positive dependency in urban SES, urgent biophilia and restorative topophilia, followed by a brief discussion applying positive dependence to urban systems challenges and management. We conclude with the importance of recognition of positive dependency as a precursor to the development of a heightened sense of ecological self and sense of ecological place in urban SES, and provide insights and suggestions for further research into civic ecology practices that may enhance positive dependency on and investment in ecological assets that contribute to positive ecological senses of self and place, and the importance of these to achieving sustainable, resilient urban futures.

abstract={Urban forest ecosystems are increasingly recognized as necessary components of a city's overall sustainability. The number of municipal governments planning and implementing urban forest management programs is rising, as the benefits of urban forest ecosystems are becoming common knowledge. However, the urban forest is an exceedingly complex and vulnerable social-ecological system that presents a wide array of management challenges. One area of concern that is understudied and worthy of investigation is the effects of housing renovation activities and neighborhood revitalization on the urban forest. The purpose of this study is to investigate the possibility of renovation activity as a significant source of disturbance in urban forest ecosystems. We conducted ordinary least squares regression and geographically weighted regression analyses using canopy cover, building permit data, and socioeconomic variables in Toronto, Canada. We then conducted a parcel-level assessment of tree mortality using ortho-imagery from 2003 and 2014 and government open data describing 16 years of renovation activity. Findings suggest that renovation activity, as indicated by building permit abundance, is a possible cause of tree mortality and subsequently a source of urban forest disturbance. Our findings also suggest that the relationship between renovation activity and canopy cover is highly complex, and is likely influenced by residential tree planting rates, land use mix, and different trajectories of urban change.},

abstract={China's recent collective forest tenure reform (CFTR) aims to improve forest conditions by devolution of forest management rights from community collectives to individual households. Studies reveal substantial local variation in CFTR implementation, but the ecological effects and underlying mechanism have received little attention. Our study focused on community-managed forests and household-managed forests in four communities located in the mountains of Southwest China. The objective was to investigate the relationship between CFTR and forest conditions at the local scale. We employed a combination of remote sensing technology, field forest observations and socioeconomic surveys to gather data for analysis. The results showed that the forest cover change trends of collective forests and household forests in each community were consistent from 1994 to 2014. There was no significant relationship between CFTR implementation and local-level differences in species diversity and soil fertility in forests. The aboveground biomass of collective forests was significantly higher than that of household forests. Differentiated access and use, low compensation amounts, and loose payment terms jointly affected CFTR's effectiveness to improve local-scale forest conditions in the study area. Attempts to formalize forest tenure rights must be flexible enough and adapted to the local environment so that changes induced by the CFTR can improve local access to forest resources and its benefits.},

abstract={Tree farming is becoming infamous among smallholders in the Caraga Administrative Region, the acclaimed ``timber corridor{''} ofthe Philippines. Despite the region's favorable biophysical condition to tree farming, attractive Cash benefits, and market availability compared to other regions of the country, tree farming has become less attractive to smallholders. The smallholders remainedpoor and marginalized even as the region's poverty incidence continually declined in the last three decades. This study seeks to determine the socioeconomic impacts of sinallholder tree farming in the region. Using both qualitative and quantitative analyses, the study revealed that tree and non-tree farmers alike perceived positive and statistically significant changes on livelihood sources, income, equity, asset accumulation, education, level of trust, reciprocity and cohesiveness in the community as a result of tree farming. However, although income was improved with tree farming, benefits were considered inequitable among different stakeholders; those endowed with financial capital captured much of the economic benefits. Worse, the lack offinancial resources has led some smallholder tree farmers to accommodate arrangements such as dependence on the purchase order (PO) holders who have control over the price oflogs that put them into a disadvantaged situation, which consequently locked them in impoverished condition. The study recommends the institutionalization ofan effective need-oriented extension programfor smallholder tree farmers, investment in market diversification and vertical integration of tree products to make smallholder tree farming more sustainable and equitable.},

abstract={In an indigenous forest community in Palawan, Philippines, honey gathering from the giant honey bee (Apis dorsata) is a traditional subsistence practice. We characterize the social-ecological dynamics of giant honey bees with indigenous peoples of Tagbanua ethnicity using the mobile agent-based ecosystem service (MABES) framework. Chemical and pollen analysis conducted on honey samples generated data on the ecological features of this linked social-ecological system. These were supplemented by 251 household surveys and key informant interviews with institutional representatives to identify the social and institutional features of the system. Honey samples analyzed for pollen showed a total of 11 different plant families and did not have any traces of pesticide residue. The majority of households interviewed use honey as food, medicine, and a saleable commodity. A small percentage of households use fertilizers and pesticides known to be harmful to bees. Institutions have different knowledge strengths that can be tapped through a transdisciplinary approach. As the scale of production and delivery of MABES is distinctly a product of the mobility of service-delivering organisms, we recommend using a landscape approachwith a focus on maintaining the quality of both the local environment and landscapes around the site of ES delivery.},

abstract={Spatially explicit information on local perceptions of ecosystem services is needed to inform land use planning within rapidly changing landscapes. In this paper we spatially modelled local people's use and perceptions of benefits horn forest ecosystem services in Borneo, horn interviews of 1837 people in 185 villages. Questions related to provisioning, cultural/spiritual, regulating and supporting ecosystem services derived horn forest, and attitudes towards forest conversion. We used boosted regression trees (BRTs) to combine interview data with social and environmental predictors to understand spatial variation of perceptions across Borneo. Our results show that people use a variety of products horn intact and highly degraded forests. Perceptions of benefits from forests were strongest: in human-altered forest landscapes for cultural and spiritual benefits; in human-altered and intact forests landscapes for health benefits; intact forest for direct health benefits, such as medicinal plants; and in regions with little forest and extensive plantations, for environmental benefits, such as climatic impacts from deforestation. Forest clearing for small scale agriculture was predicted to be widely supported yet less so for large-scale agriculture. Understanding perceptions of rural communities in dynamic, multi-use landscapes is important where people are often directly affected by the decline in ecosystem services. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Mountainous areas are expected to face increasing societal pressure due to mass tourism and the rising intensity and frequency of natural hazards triggered by climate change. Therefore, the development of proper strategies for the management of environmental risks will be crucial to ensure their liveability. Against this backdrop, concepts such as territorial resilience and Social-Ecological Systems (SES) can support the prioritisation of protective efforts. This paper presents a conceptual framework to be applied to areas subject to natural hazards. Its aim is to support the integration of different measures, with a special focus on protection forests and other Nature-based Solutions, into current risk management strategies. The framework considers (i) the definition of SES boundaries; (ii) the identification of the main goals to be achieved; (iii) the quantification of the supply and demand of the ecosystem protection service; and (iv) the development of risk management strategies able to include the management of protection forests among the adopted solutions. This framework is intended as a tool to be adopted by local and regional decision-makers as a tool to identify the areas at risk, to recognise the potential role of protection forests, and to operationalise the concept of resilience through the deployment of ``grey-green{''} strategies.},

abstract={Mountain farming sustains human well-being by providing various ecosystem services (ES). In the last decades, socio-economic developments have led to worldwide changes in land-use/cover (LULC), but the related effects on ES have not been fully explored. This study aimed at assessing the impacts of the transformation of agricultural land on ES in the European Alps. We mapped 19 ES within the agriculturally used areas in the year 2000 and analyzed LULC changes by 2018. We compared eight regions with a similar development, regarding social-ecological characteristics, to outline contrasting trends. Our results indicate that the ES decreased most strongly in regions with a massive abandonment of mountain grassland, while ES in the `traditional agricultural region' remained the most stable. In regions with an intensification of agriculture, together with urban sprawl, ES had the lowest values. Across all regions, a shift from ES that are typically associated with mountain farming towards forest-related ES occurred, due to forest regrowth. By relating differing trends in ES to social-ecological developments, we can discuss our findings regarding new landscapes and farming systems across the European Alps. Our quantitative and spatially explicit findings provide a valuable basis for policy development, from the regional to the international/EU level, and for adopting sustainable management strategies.},

journal={ECOSYSTEMS AND PEOPLE},
year={2021},
volume={17},

month={JAN 1},
abstract={The concept of ecosystem services (ES) and related conceptual frameworks like the cascade model, can be relevant to explore the ways through which people and nature are connected and how the benefits of nature, upon which people depend, are realised. An integrated cascade framework was used to study the ES pathway of pine resin, a traded forest product, in a rural mountain community in Mexico. We conducted mixed-methods research, combining participatory tools with measures of service capacity, resin yield, and key farmer endowments. Resin was co-produced by an intricate interaction between the human and natural components of the social-ecological system. Substantial human inputs and coordinated efforts were required to realise resin benefits, and people's appreciation and plural values emerged along the whole service pathway. Though there were stark differences in natural resource endowments, working farmers gained a high share of resin's income through labour, labour relations and social networks. But most social conflicts and struggles also occurred over labour relations and organisation, revealing power dynamics. Furthermore, external actors controlled different mechanisms of access, and exerted power over the community's ability to derive benefits from resin. In resin co-production, values connect people to the landscape, while labour and power mediate the access to nature's benefits.},

abstract={Adaptation in human and natural systems has received growing attention in sustainability scholarship. Co-adaptation, when coupled human and natural systems (CHANSs) adapt in congruence, is receiving much less attention. Not only are various forms of co-adaptation difficult to disentangle, adaptations are also conceptualized very differently by scholars of human and natural systems. One aspect of adaptation that scholars agree on, however, is that it is first and foremost a change. We offer a new transdisciplinary typology of the four most basic types of change, internally and externally driven non-structural and structural changes, that bridges perspectives in the natural and social sciences and through which we introduce new categories of adaptations and forms of co-adaptation in CHANSs. We first describe the typology's foundations and its four types of change. We then organize forms of adaptation in human and natural systems according to the types of change they exhibit to identify new categories of adaptations and forms of co-adaptation. Finally, we illustrate the application of the new categories and forms in a real-world CHANS-the privately managed Northwoods in the Upper Midwest, USA. This new typology paves the way for robust and cross-disciplinary research on CHANSs.},

abstract={Silvopastoral systems (SPS) emerge with a renewal interest in the Mediterranean for their promotion of multifunctionality through a variety of ecosystem services (ES). However, the understanding of how combined forestry and pastoral practices affect the ES delivery as well as the synergies and trade-off dynamics amongst them is still very limited. We applied the structured expert consultation Delphi method to assess the medium-term effect of relevant silvopastoral management practices (SMP) on the delivery of provision, regulation and maintenance and cultural ES in Mediterranean mid-mountain SPS in Spain. The deliberation process entailed two rounds and the Delphi panel was finally formed by 69 experts covering a broad spectrum of background and expertise. Results show that some practices, such as silvicultural treatments (e.g., thinning or coppice selection), play a multifunctional role contributing to ES delivery in bundles while some trade-offs are also identified between SMP, such as free animal grazing, and the provision of some ES. Synergies are also found between ES, such as livestock production and recreational hunting and between timber production and carbon sequestration, whereas possible trade-offs were particularly relevant between wildfire prevention and carbon sequestration. These findings can support decision-making processes towards sustainable and multifunctional silvopastoral management in the northern Mediterranean basin.},

abstract={Ecosystem-based disaster management focus on conservation or restoration of ecosystem services provided by healthy ecosystems. To be put into practice, this approach requires the engagement of different social actors in collaborative processes that reduce the risk of disasters. In this research, we analyzed the engagement of social actors in the restoration of coastal ecosystems after the successive arson fires that occurred in 2019 in the Serra do Tabuleiro State Park (STSP), Santa Catarina, Brazil. We collected data through documentary research, semistructured interviews with participants in an event focused on recovering the burnt areas, and participant observation in the elaboration of two plans: 1) Forest Fire Fighting Contingency Plan in the Baixada do Massiambu, and 2) Action Plan for Ecological Restoration of the Baixada do Massiambu. Our results suggest that fires act as a trigger for a process of public engagement involving social actors with different backgrounds, motivations, and knowledge about the STSP. The analyzed plans promote inter-scale articulations between organizations aiming the conservation of ecosystems. Public engagement is the result of three factors: investment in training and development of projects for community mobilization, worsening of power disputes over projects for the territory, and media construction of an image of fires in the Amazon associated with the disruption of Brazilian environmental policy.},

abstract={Food forestsedible, perennial, polyculture systemsare of increasing interest in North America and the United Kingdom, as reflected in projects ranging from urban food initiatives to integrated conservation and restoration planning. To examine emerging food forestry (FF) against the backdrop of ecological restoration (ER), we conducted semi-structured interviews with eight experts each from the fields of FF and ER in conjunction with observations of food forests in Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom. Using content analysis, our study builds a FF model that encompasses the underlying goals of emerging FFforest function; diversity of yields; education and culture sharing; healthy habitats for people and other species; and sustainability. We argue that FF has potential as an urban restoration tool in terms of enhancing the multifunctionality of heterogeneous landscapes undergoing significant changes. This will require meaningful consideration of ethical issues (e.g. commodification of nature), landscape contexts, ecological integrity, integration of historical knowledge, and resilience for interdependent, dynamic social and ecological systems. Moreover, systematic, long-term monitoring of different types of food forests will be crucial in order to mindfully apply FF in ER. This research provides one of the first in-depth analyses of how emerging FF might contribute to restoration in the time of the Anthropocene, especially outside traditional tropic regions where most FF has been practiced.},

abstract={Little is known about the emergence and development of novel governance approaches for forest ecosystem services provision, what drives them, and how they can be fostered. Existing frameworks often deal with single aspects of resource management and thus fail to assess processes, multi-level influences, and interacting dimensions and factors in a system-based understanding. In this article, we introduce the conceptual foundation and an empirical application of an adapted Social-Ecological System framework with additional elements that builds on the idea of complex and interlinked social-ecological-technical-forestry-innovation systems that allows for the identification of key factors for revealing forest ecosystem services dynamics to understand the emergence and development of such governance innovations. The development and testing of the framework was based on six case studies for knowledge co-creation. To showcase its application, two governance innovations were examined: a voluntary carbon market payment scheme in Germany and a network approach for forest-pasture management in Italy. The application of the framework reveals required adaptations to improve innovation by systematically unpacking the system dimensions and identifying fostering and hindering factors and their interdependencies. We highlight the output of a sound system-based information basis that allows for purposeful innovation conditioning by policy makers, practitioners, and other related actors.},

abstract={The aim of this study was to help understand the interaction of rural people with tropical dry forests. It was based on social research conducted in the Chamela-Cuixmala region, on the Pacific coast of Mexico. The analytical tools used in the study included stakeholder identification, environmental history and social perceptions. The two main social groups in the study were ejidatarios, who own most of the territory, and avecindados, who possess no land but have high population numbers. Through an interpretative methodological approach we documented the vision and meaning that rural people give to their natural and social worlds. The agricultural development model promoted by the Mexican government for decades was identified as the main driver of ecosystem transformation. Rural people, who arrived recently in the region, were proud of the pasture-lands that were transformed from tropical forests. Conservation policies implemented during the last two decades were viewed as impositions although people recognized the value of services provided by ecosystems. This case study has helped to unravel the main dimensions of the human system and how it relates to structures of signification. The social panorama unveiled can be used as an initial basis to promote further research on the social-ecological system of the Chamela-Cuixmala region and to develop future participatory management schemes.},

journal={ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},

volume={13},

pages={NA},
month={NA},
abstract={The expansion of urban land uses into farmlands and forests requires an assessment of future ecological impacts. Spatially explicit agent-based models can represent the changes in resilience and ecological services that result from different land-use policies. When modeling complex adaptive systems, both the methods used to interpret results and the standards of rigor used to judge adequacy are complicated and require additional research. Recent studies suggest that it would be appropriate to use these models as an extension of exploratory analysis. This type of analysis generates ensembles of alternate plausible representations of future system conditions. User expertise steers interactive, stepwise system exploration toward inductive reasoning about potential changes to the system. In this study, we develop understanding of the potential alternative futures for a social-ecological system by way of successive simulations that test variations in the types and numbers of policies. The model addresses the agricultural-urban interface and the preservation of ecosystem services. The landscape analyzed is at the junction of the McKenzie and Willamette Rivers adjacent to the cities of Eugene and Springfield in Lane County, Oregon. Our exploration of alternative future scenarios suggests that policies that constrain urban growth and create incentives for farming and forest enterprises to preserve and enhance habitat can protect ecosystem resilience and services.},

title={Emergence unites ecology and society},
journal={ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
year={2005},
volume={10},
number={1},
pages={NA},
month={JUN},
abstract={The effort to combine analysis of ecosystems and social systems requires a firm theoretical basis. When humans are present in an ecosystem, their actions affect emergent structures; this paper examines forms of emergence that account for the presence of humans. Humans monitor and regulate ecosystems based on their cultural systems. Cultural systems consist of concepts linked in complicated ways that can form consistent world views, can contain inconsistencies, and may or may not accurately model the properties of a social-ecological system. Consequently, human monitoring and regulating processes will differ, depending on cultural systems. Humans, as agents, change or maintain pre-existing material and cultural emergent structures. The presentation is illustrated with a case study of fire-prone forests. The paper shows that explicit attention to emergence serves very well in unifying the following requirements for social-ecological analysis: coherent and observable definitions of sustainability; ways to link ecological and social phenomena; ways to understand cultural reasons for stability and instability in dynamic social-ecological systems; and ways to include human self-evaluation and culture within dynamic models of social-ecological systems. Analysis of cultural emergent structures clarifies many differences in assumptions among the fields of economics, sociology, political science, ecology, and ecological economics. Because it can be readily applied to empirical questions, the framework provides a good way to organize policy analysis that is not dominated by one or another discipline.},

month={FEB 2},
abstract={Streamside forests of urbanizing coastal regions lie at the nexus of global changes: rising sea levels, increasing storm surge, expanding urban development, and invasive species. To understand how these combined stressors affect forest conditions, we identified forest patches adjacent to urban land, analyzed adjacent land cover, modeled forest inundation, and sampled 100 sites across the Chesapeake Bay and Delaware Bay watersheds. We found that the majority of forest patches are adjacent to urban land and projected flooding will affect 8-19\% of regional forested land. We observed non-native invasive plants in 94\% of forest plots. Trees were predominantly native, but over half of shrub stems were invasive species and more than 80\% of plots contained invasive woody vines. Disturbance of human origin was correlated with abundance of invasive trees. Signs of deer activity were common. Richness and number of growth forms of invasive plants were related to adjacent agricultural land cover. These data reveal that streamside forests are impacted by the interacting stressors of urbanization, climate change, and invasive species spread. Our results emphasize the importance of protection and restoration of forests in urban regions and point to the need for a social-ecological systems approach to improve their condition.},

title={Biocultural restoration in Hawai'i also achieves core conservation goals},
journal={ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
year={2020},
volume={25},
number={1},
pages={NA},
month={MAR},
abstract={Biocultural approaches to restoration have demonstrated multiple benefits for human communities, but the ecological benefits and trade-offs involved have received little attention. Using a case study from Hawai'i, we examined if forest restoration aimed at reviving and maintaining cultural interactions with the forest is compatible with other priority conservation metrics. We identified species of high biocultural value for an Indigenous (Native Hawaiian) community, and then tested if these species also have high conservation value in terms of their biogeographic origin, ability to support native wildlife, and ability to persist independently within the restored context. Additionally, we tested if an assemblage of species with high biocultural value can also support high functional trait diversity. We found bioculturally important species to have high conservation values for all metrics tested, except for the ability to conserve rare or endangered endemic species. However, a broader application of biocultural conservation, such as the revival of the ``sacred forest{'' concept, can address this priority as part of a mosaic of different species assemblages and levels of access. We also found that biocultural value may, at least in part, be a function of coevolutionary time: the length of time over which a community has interacted with a given species. Given that forests are invaluable to many Indigenous communities and, given the existential threats many of these communities currently face, we suggest that forests containing species assemblages of high biocultural value, such as those in Hawai?i, be considered as critical cultural habitat.},

abstract={Green infrastructure (GI) is widely recognized for reducing risk of flooding, improving water quality, and harvesting stormwater for potential future use. GI can be an important part of a strategy used in urban planning to enhance sustainable development and urban resilience. However, existing literature lacks a comprehensive assessment framework to evaluate GI performance in terms of promoting ecosystem functions and services for social-ecological system resilience. We propose a robust indicator set consisting of quantitative and qualitative measurements for a scenario-based planning support system to assess the capacity of urban resilience. Green Infrastructure in Urban Resilience Planning Support System (GIUR-PSS) supports decision-making for GI planning through scenario comparisons with the urban resilience capacity index. To demonstrate GIUR-PSS, we developed five scenarios for the Congress Run sub-watershed (Mill Creek watershed, Ohio, USA) to test common types of GI (rain barrels, rain gardens, detention basins, porous pavement, and open space). Results show the open space scenario achieves the overall highest performance (GI Urban Resilience Index = 4.27/5). To implement the open space scenario in our urban demonstration site, suitable vacant lots could be converted to greenspace (e.g., forest, detention basins, and low-impact recreation areas). GIUR-PSS is easy to replicate, customize, and apply to cities of different sizes to assess environmental, economic, and social benefits provided by different types of GI installations.

abstract={Fire in the forested tropics has profound environmental, economic, and social impacts at multiple geographical scales. Causes of tropical fires are widely documented, although research contributions are from many disciplines, and each tends to focus on specific facets of a research problem, which might limit understanding of fire as a complex social-ecological system. We conducted a systematic review to (1) examine geographic and methodological focus in tropical fire research; (2) identify which types of landholders are the focus of the research effort; (3) test for a research method effect on the variables, e. g., socio-political, economic, and climatic, identified as causes of and proposed management solutions to tropical fire; and (4) examine relationships between causal factors and proposed solutions. Results from 51 studies show distinct geographic and methodological tendencies in the literature. Few studies explicitly identify landholder types, and no social studies focused on large-landholders. Multiple drivers and potential solutions to preventing fire are identified and the research approach adopted had the strongest influence on the socioeconomic, direct fire management and landscape characteristics variables. There was an overall mismatch between identified cause and proposed management solution. These findings indicate that mixed method approaches are imperative to understanding the coupled human-nature system of fire and to improve rural development and management strategies to curtail tropical fire spread.},

abstract={Restoration depends on purpose and context. At the core it entails innovation to halt ongoing and reverse past degradation. It aims for increased functionality, not necessarily recovering past system states. Location-specific interventions in social-ecological systems reducing proximate pressures, need to synergize with transforming generic drivers of unsustainable land use. After reviewing pantropical international research on forests, trees, and agroforestry, we developed an options-by-context typology. Four intensities of land restoration interact: R.I. Ecological intensification within a land use system, R.II. Recovery/regeneration, within a local social-ecological system, R.III. Reparation/recuperation, requiring a national policy context, R.IV. Remediation, requiring international support and investment. Relevant interventions start from core values of human identity while addressing five potential bottlenecks: Rights, Know-how, Markets (inputs, outputs, credit), Local Ecosystem Services (including water, agrobiodiversity, micro/mesoclimate) and Teleconnections (global climate change, biodiversity). Six stages of forest transition (from closed old-growth forest to open-field agriculture and re-treed (peri)urban landscapes) can contextualize interventions, with six special places: water towers, riparian zone and wetlands, peat landscapes, small islands and mangroves, transport infrastructure, and mining scars. The typology can help to link knowledge with action in people-centric restoration in which external stakeholders coinvest, reflecting shared responsibility for historical degradation and benefits from environmental stewardship.},

abstract={Purpose-The cumulative effects of climate change exacerbate interruption of social-ecological system. The purpose of this paper is to investigate whether the consumption smoothing along with other socioeconomic parameters of households affects the common pool resource base of a forest in an economic depression resulted from climate change triggered disasters. Design/methodology/approach-This paper is a field level study of Koyra sub-district in the Southwestern coastal region of Bangladesh. Several parameters namely climatic trends and events, damage pattern suffered by households, change in land ownership and occupation pattern and consumption dependency pattern were considered. Methods used for data collection were household questionnaire survey and focus group discussions in the study area. Findings-Both the intensity and frequency of climate change led catastrophes are found higher in the study area resulting damage of assets and capital goods of households. The average annual disaster damage borne by per household is found US\$177. Over the last two decades 8.21 per cent households become landless. During same time span more than 25 per cent households switched from cropping to other non-agricultural occupations and more than 26 per cent households depend on forest resource for their consumption smoothing. Originality/value-The paper provides insights how climate change led disasters induce the households to depend on the resource from the mangrove forest Sundarbans for their livelihood earning as well as consumption smoothing.},

volume={36},
number={8},
pages={904-915},
month={DEC},
abstract={The responses of urban park woodlands to large disturbances provide the opportunity to identify and examine linkages in social-ecological systems in urban landscapes. We propose that the Panarchy model consisting of hierarchically nested adaptive cycles provides a useful framework to evaluate those linkages. We use two case studies as examples Cherokee Park in Louisville, Kentucky, USA and Tijuca Forest in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. In the Cherokee Park case study, the disturbance, a destructive tornado, triggered bottom-up societal responses that created new institutions that influenced park management and shifted the woodland community from a successional pathway dominated by invasive exotic plants to one where native plant species are regaining importance. In the Tijuca Forest example, the disturbance, large scale land-use changes during the 18th century, triggered primarily top-down societal responses to create the world's largest urban forest through a transformative programme of intensive multispecies forest replanting and management. Currently, fine scale disturbances primarily anthropogenically caused fire threaten portions of Tijuca Forest through loss of forest structure and establishment of flammable invasive plants, and again elicited top-down societal responses to stop further destruction and promote greater native plant regeneration. These case studies illustrate that either natural or anthropogenic disturbances to natural systems can alter the direction and magnitude of interactions between social and natural domains in urban landscapes in a co-adaptive manner that alters structures and processes in both system components.},

abstract={Sustainable management of complex social-ecological systems depends on understanding the effects of different drivers of change, but disentangling these effects poses a challenge. We provide a framework for quantifying the relative contributions of different components of a social-ecological system to the system's outcomes, using forest fires in the western United States as a model. Specifically, we examine the difference in wildfire probability in similar forests under different management regimes (federally managed vs. privately owned) in eleven western states from 1989-2016 and compare the magnitude of the management effect to the effect of climate variables. We find a greater probability of wildfires in federally managed forests than in privately owned forests, with a 127\% increase in the absolute difference between the two management regimes over the 28 year time period. However, in 1989, federally managed forests were 2.67 times more likely to burn than privately owned forests, but in 2016, they were only 1.52 times more likely to burn. Finally, we find that the effect of the different management regimes is greater than the marginal (one-unit change) effect of most climate variables. Our results indicate that projections of future fire probability must account for both climate and management variables, while our methodology provides a framework for quantitatively comparing different drivers of change in complex social-ecological systems.},

title={Vulnerability of Community-Based Forest Management to Climate Variability and Extremes: Emerging Insights on the Contribution of REDD},
journal={SMALL-SCALE FORESTRY},
year={2017},
volume={16},
number={2},
pages={249-274},
month={JUN},
abstract={Climate change spurs havoc on social-ecological system. People and places vulnerable to climate change have been the focus of many discussions. However, in the forestry sector, limited studies have been conducted that link human vulnerability to recent initiatives, such as reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation or REDD+, especially in highly vulnerable countries. Using case studies from the Philippines, this paper focuses on the vulnerability of two community-based forest management (CBFM) organizations, with and without REDD+ readiness intervention, to show the impacts of climate variability and extremes. Two balance-weighted approaches, the livelihood vulnerability index and the IPCC-framework, were used in the vulnerability assessments. Results revealed high vulnerability of both CBFM organizations, although Malitbog Upland Developers for Sustainable Association (MUDSA) livelihood vulnerability is largely aggravated by its exposure to disaster, climate variability and extremes, accessibility to health facilities and water supply. The long history of CBFM implementation in both organizations have minimal contribution in enhancing the adaptive capacity of members to cope with and adapt to climate change impacts. REDD+ (readiness), does not insure reduced vulnerability to climate change, unless sustainable livelihood is achieved. As the State controls forest resources, the rights of CBFM-organizations to commercially benefit from these resources are limited, a disincentive to the development of new and viable development programs in CBFM areas, such as REDD+. This also constrains the achievement of climate resiliency.},

abstract={Mitigating climate change, preventing mass species extinctions, improving rural livelihoods, and disaster risk reduction are among today's most urgent challenges. To meet these challenges, a large number of social actors need to agree to engage and act collectively on Forest and Landscape Restoration (FLR), ensuring its dual goal of restoring ecological functionality and improving people's wellbeing. Although FLR has gained momentum globally, the experiences so far continue to face socio-economic and governance challenges associated with the design and realization of effective efforts. Social Innovation (SI) can be seen contemporarily as the process and the result of interaction between stakeholders in the construction of solutions to social needs and problems, including those tackled by FLR. Here, using a content analysis approach applied to existing literature, we propose five possible conceptual bridges between FLR and SI. The Social Innovative - Forest and Landscape Restoration (SI-FLR) process advocates that sustainable livelihood needs should be attended first to ensure the Social-Ecological Systems' resilience. These bridges are: (1) ``Landscape as the main context{''}; (2) ``Nature as social need{'' (3) ``Landscape stewardship groups{''}; (4) ``Governance capabilities{''}; (5) ``Adapting and transforming to enhance resilience.{''} Identifying these bridges, will help decision-makers and project managers to improve the FLR initiatives by supporting the potential of SI and sparking the interest of other researchers to explore the many possibilities of SI-FLR.},

abstract={Climate change and ecological transformation are causing natural resource management to be applied to nonstationary systems. Managers can respond to dynamic ecosystems by resisting, accepting, or directing ecological change. Management response is constrained by a decision context, defined as an interconnected social system of values, rules, and knowledge that affects how problems can be addressed. We provide a multi-scale blueprint for creating a decision context that increases capacity for implementing climate adaptation, including novel approaches in the National Wildlife Refuge System, a continental conservation network administered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. We use the Tetlin National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska as case study to illustrate blueprint concepts and to provide ``proof-of-concept{''} for application. The blueprint builds on ideas and practices from scenario planning, adaptive management, and adaptive pathway planning, which are approaches that promote action in the face of uncertainty. Management considerations focus on stewarding biodiversity in a changing climate by addressing what futures are possible, what interventions can be used to shape future conditions, and how to coordinate a regional conservation strategy. The blueprint focus on decision context promotes a longer-term social process of engagement that is complementary to, but larger than, any one decision process.},

title={Adaptive capacity in social-ecological systems: a framework for addressing bark beetle disturbances in natural resource management},
journal={SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE},
year={2020},
volume={15},
number={2, SI},
pages={555-567},
month={MAR},
abstract={The ability of natural resource agencies to act before, during, and after outbreaks of conifer bark beetles (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) is important to ensure the continued provision of ecosystem services. Adaptive capacity refers to the capability of an agent or system to adapt to change, regardless of whether it is examined as an independent social or ecological entity, or as a coupled social-ecological system. Understanding the components of a disturbance and the associated effects to ecosystem services, social systems, and natural resource management increases the ability to adapt to change and ensure continued resilience. This paper presents a definition and conceptual framework of adaptive capacity relevant to bark beetle disturbances that was developed through an interdisciplinary workshop held in 2016. The intent is to assist natural resource managers and policy-makers in identifying important adaptation characteristics to effectively address bark beetle disturbances. The current state of knowledge regarding institutional, social, and environmental factors that influence adaptive capacity are identified. The mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) in the western USA is used as a specific example to discuss several factors that influence adaptive capacity for increasing resilience. We hope that that our proposed framework serves as a model for future collaborations among both social and physical scientists and land managers to better address landscape-level disturbances that are being exacerbated by climate change.},

title={Vulnerability and adaptation to climate-related fire impacts in rural and urban interior Alaska},
journal={POLAR RESEARCH},

volume={28},
number={1},
pages={100-118},
month={APR},
abstract={This paper explores whether fundamental differences exist between urban and rural vulnerability to climate-induced changes in the fire regime of interior Alaska. We further examine how communities and fire managers have responded to these changes and what additional adaptations could be put in place. We engage a variety of social science methods, including demographic analysis, semi-structured interviews, surveys, workshops and observations of public meetings. This work is part of an interdisciplinary study of feedback and interactions between climate, vegetation, fire and human components of the Boreal forest social-ecological system of interior Alaska. We have learned that although urban and rural communities in interior Alaska face similar increased exposure to wildfire as a result of climate change, important differences exist in their sensitivity to these biophysical, climate-induced changes. In particular, reliance on wild foods, delayed suppression response, financial resources and institutional connections vary between urban and rural communities. These differences depend largely on social, economic and institutional factors, and are not necessarily related to biophysical climate impacts per se. Fire management and suppression action motivated by political, economic or other pressures can serve as unintentional or indirect adaptation to climate change. However, this indirect response alone may not sufficiently reduce vulnerability to a changing fire regime. More deliberate and strategic responses may be required, given the magnitude of the expected climate change and the likelihood of an intensification of the fire regime in interior Alaska.},

abstract={Rattan is the most important non-forest timber product utilized by communities adjacent Lore Lindu National Park (LLNP). The establishment community conservation agreement (CCA) in 2001 was unable to prevent rattan depletion. Then, a local institution called community conservation partnership (CCP) has been recently proposed Therefore, the objective of this study is to explore how to craft a local institution of CCP for sustainable rattan governance in LLNP using Social-Ecological Systems (SES) Framework. The study was conducted in LLNP area and Ngata Toro, a buffer zone village of LLNP. We conducted rattan inventory and collected social data by interview for analyzing CCP development using SES framework. The results showed that CCP is most likely to be successful in implementing due to several reasons. Firstly, the establishment of constitutional-choice rules made clear the nested enterprise. Secondly, the reallocation of CCP location to the traditional zone increase the boundary clarity. Thirdly, transferring rights to the Ngata Toro community will make effective co-management, increase the legitimacy of rattan utilization, decrease potential conflicts among resource unit users and reducing monitoring cost. Finally, deciding the rattan harvesting quota will ensure the rattan ecological and livelihood sustainability. With the clarity of system boundaries and property rights, we argue that CCP institutions will bring many benefits in many ways. Overall, most variables of SES framework can be used to analyses the readiness of CCP institutional arrangement for sustainable rattan management in LLNP.},

abstract={Tropical countries lie at the nexus of three pressing issues for global sustainability: agricultural production, climate change mitigation and biodiversity conservation. The forces that drive forest protection do not necessarily oppose those that drive forest clearance for development. This decoupling, enhanced by the stronger economic forces compared to conservation, is detrimental for the social-ecological sustainability of forested tropical landscapes. This paper presents an integrated, and spatially-explicit, Agent-Based Model that examines the future impacts of land-use change scenarios on the sustainability of the Wet Tropics region of tropical Queensland, Australia. In particular, the model integrates Bayesian Belief Networks, Geographical Information Systems, empirical data and expert knowledge, under a land-sharing/land-sparing analysis, to study the impact of different landscape configurations on trade-offs and synergies among biodiversity and two ecosystem services (sugarcane production and carbon sequestration). Contrary to most tropical regions, model simulations show that Business As Usual is helping to reconcile these contrasting goals in the forested landscape of the Wet Tropics. The paper analyses which combination of governance and socio-economic factors is causing these positive results. This is an outstanding achievement for a tropical region, considering that most tropical areas are characterized for having stronger economic-land clearing forces compared to conservation forces, which reduce important ecosystem services for human wellbeing and the health of ecosystems.},

abstract={Yak herding is one of the oldest market-based traditions, which is part of an integrated social-ecological system. But, it is at risk of extinction as yak herders are gradually shifting towards alternative occupations. The discontinuation of herding may have several implications such as loss of culture and degradation of the rangeland ecosystem. Though yak herding is not limited to the financial aspect of herding, this is considered a main cause of the discontinuation. Therefore, it is important to understand the economics of yak herding. A benefit-cost analysis of yak herding was carried out based on the interviews with 60 yak herders in the Kanchenjunga landscape, Nepal. The results indicate that yak herding is not financially attractive. High mortality of calves and adults is threatening this occupation, and degrading rangelands are increasing the costs. Yak herding generates substantial amount of social and ecological benefits in terms of preserving culture, maintaining rangeland ecosystems and curbing illegal activities. If these benefits are included, then the benefit-cost ratio and internal rate of return would be 1.32 and 10.44 respectively. Since yak herding generates low direct profits and requires herders to stay in remote areas, there is a high risk of discontinuation of this profession by successive generations of youth. This study suggests to improve rangeland management through prescribed burning and provisioning of health services, particularly in summer pastures and incentivize yak herders for generating positive externalities.},

pages={197-205},
month={JAN},
abstract={The question of under what settings locally managed forests will lead to successful conservation without frustrating the local people's subsistence outcomes remains contested. This research investigates the relationship between attributes of locally managed forest SES and its forest and livelihood outcomes using data from 83 forest SESs across seven countries. The data were obtained from the International Forestry Resources and Institutions (IFRI) database. Thirteen predicators that were selected from the attributes of forest, user group and governance of the local forest SES were used to evaluate their influence on SES sustainability. Our results showed that sustainable forest SES was significantly associated with forest size, diversity of the NTFP that is extracted from the forest, networks among the forest users, rule making by external non-forest harvest organizations in dispute resolution, and benefits sharing. On the other hand, the distance of forest users' settlements in the forest, rule making for forest protection and harvest quantity as well as sanctions by external non-forest harvest organizations were found to be significantly associated with unsustainable forest SESs. Our findings have important implications for the ongoing discourse on how to promote sustainable forest management at local level. The results on the success factors can assist decision makers to improve the chances for the success of forest governance that rely on local people who depend upon forests. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Protected areas (PA) are effective means for protecting biodiversity, but less is known about their effect on the social-ecological system (SES). Using a semi-experimental approach and a descriptive case study based evaluation, we analyzed the effect of a PA in the Yucatan Peninsula on land-cover and household resource management strategies in time and space (before and after the PA establishment; inside and outside its limits). To assess the changes of land-use practices in the areas surrounding the communities inside and outside the PA, and their change over time (from 2003 to 2015), we used remote sensing analysis and semi-structured interviews. Our results show that after the PA was established, the forest increased and agricultural plots decreased inside and to a lesser extent outside the PA. However, fires reduced the area of old-growth forest and increased young secondary forest, highlighting the system's vulnerability to uncommon events. Resource management strategies were also affected: while inside the PA households tended toward specializing on tourism, outside the PA household strategies implied a diversification of productive activities. Overall, the establishment of the PA proved to be an effective tool to promote forest recovery and prevent deforestation in the regions surrounding the communities both inside and outside the PA.},

title={Comparing social representations of the landscape: a methodology},
journal={ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
year={2020},
volume={25},
number={2},
pages={NA},
month={JUN},
abstract={Social representations (SRs) are systems of values, ideas, and practices that characterize individuals' and social groups' relationships to both their social and natural environment. Comparing SRs between places, social groups, and through time is critical to understanding how social-ecological systems (SESs) and their diverse uses are perceived, interpreted, and understood. This knowledge needs to be taken into account to achieve efficient land use management of SESs such as agricultural landscapes. People's perceptions of the landscape are increasingly studied in sustainability sciences and a growing number of studies use the SR framework for analyzing differences in SRs between stakeholders and localities or for detecting changes over time. Robust methodologies able to compare SRs are required for this purpose. In this paper, we propose a modular approach to studying SRs from words collected from free listing tasks. This approach relies on standardizing definitions of frequency thresholds commonly used to assess SR content, consensus level, and structure. We then illustrate the value of this methodological approach through a comparative study of farmers' social representations of the agricultural landscape among four contrasted social-ecological contexts in France. We show how our comparative method allows for characterizing spatial variations in SRs and identifying social-ecological factors that influence the structuration and content of SRs. Finally, we discuss our methodological progress and the implications of our results for public policies aimed at managing SESs and in particular agricultural landscapes for conservation.},

abstract={ContextMany landscapes are constrained into pathways featuring deforestation, loss of biodiversity, and rising mega-disturbances due to legacies and feedbacks preserved in ecosystems and institutions. Institutions are the norms and rules that emerge locally or are set by prevailing powers, and that mediate coupled social-ecological dynamics.ObjectivesWe analyzed coupled landscape-institutional dynamics contributing to path-dependent mega-disturbances and the depletion of old-growth forests in temperate forests of British Columbia, Canada (1858-2020).MethodsWe used qualitative historical review to contextualize dynamics in a hierarchy of institutional structures (i.e., power dynamics), functions (i.e., policy interventions), and processes (i.e., land management activities) and quantitative data to reconstruct their landscape outcomes. We examined connections between institutions and landscapes with a focus on temporal lags, legacies, and feedbacks.ResultsInstitutional structure persisted as an overarching colonial legacy (since 1858) whereas institutional functions (e.g., policy interventions) were added more frequently (every 10-30 years) but tended to layer onto existing functions rather than replace them. Institutional processes dynamically reshaped forests through regimes of harvesting, tree planting, and fire suppression, while a fourth process of landscape monitoring acted as a feedback to enable institutional adaptation depending on what was monitored and by who.ConclusionsWe describe lags, legacies, and feedbacks as causal forces of change in landscape-institutional co-evolution, and contribute to emerging theory on the landscape ecology of institutions. To foster social-ecological resilience we recommend to (1) manage forests more locally; (2) restore complex landscapes; and (3) use reflective processes to help transform institutions to meet emerging landscape challenges.},

month={JUN 1},
abstract={The sustainable management of forests is a critical global challenge that requires meeting human needs while also preserving forest ecosystems and the livelihoods they provide. To achieve this goal, forest management must encompass all goods and services provided by the forest, and increasingly, forests are being viewed as complex social-ecological systems that require adaptive and multifunctional management. One key aspect of sustainable and multifunctional forest management is the use of shared infrastructures, such as roads, to connect the capacity for production and multifunctional use. However, the provision of roads raises issues and dilemmas, particularly in contexts where different forest functions have conflicting objectives. Effective governance is essential to address these challenges. In this article, we propose a control problem framework with infinite horizon that integrates the role of roads and their governance into adaptive management. Our approach involves using a dynamical forest model that considers the roads related to forest functions as part of the mathematical viability theory problem. We distinguish between different scenarios of mono-functional and multifunctional forest management and examine the safe operating space of the exploited ecosystems for each scenario. Our results demonstrate the formalization of complex interactions within a multifunctional forest system and highlight how even small changes in infrastructure provision strategies can dramatically impact the safe operating space of the forest ecosystem. By incorporating shared infrastructures into adaptive forest management, we can ensure the sustainability of both the forest ecosystem and the human communities that depend on it.},

abstract={Grazing-based livestock production, named pastoralism, is classified into nomadism, transhumance and agro-pastoralism. Transhumance is characterised by the seasonal and recurring movement of livestock whereby seasonal grazing areas and routes for livestock movement are fixed. All grazing based livestock production systems including transhumance are constrained globally for a variety of reasons. The major threats to the system are globalisation, nationalisation or privatisation of rangelands, national parks and community forestry policies restricting free grazing and shortage of labour. The collapse or decline of such social-ecological systems (SESs), which have existed for over 1000s years, often induces adverse impacts on societies and ecosystems. Here we review the literature on transhumance, and discuss reasons for transhumance, and the associated advantages and disadvantages of livestock movement in transhumance. Our review also focuses on how the integration of crop and livestock production in transhumance derives mutual benefits. The review indicates that the seasonal movement of livestock is an ecological necessity in areas with harsh climates and low pasture production. Transhumance is also a herders' adaptive management to adjust to variable grazing resources and environmental conditions. The disadvantages of seasonal movement of livestock such as greater herding labour required and expenditure of more energy for livestock, are far outweighed by the ecological advantages. Some of these are: to minimise grazing competition and to protect rangeland pastures from being over-grazed. Our review also indicates that the integration of crop and livestock production derives mutual benefits and contributes for their enhanced sustainability.},

title={Rapid ecosystem change challenges the adaptive capacity of Local Environmental Knowledge},
journal={GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS},

volume={31},
number={NA},
pages={272-284},
month={MAR},
abstract={The use of Local Environmental Knowledge has been considered as an important strategy for adaptive management in the face of Global Environmental Change. However, the unprecedented rates at which global change occurs may pose a challenge to the adaptive capacity of local knowledge systems. In this paper, we use the concept of the shifting baseline syndrome to examine the limits in the adaptive capacity of the local knowledge of an indigenous society facing rapid ecosystem change. We conducted semi-structured interviews regarding perceptions of change in wildlife populations and in intergenerational transmission of knowledge amongst the Tsimane', a group of hunter-gatherers of Bolivian Amazonia (n = 300 adults in 13 villages). We found that the natural baseline against which the Tsimane' measure ecosystem changes might be shifting with every generation as a result of (a) age-related differences in the perception of change and (b) a decrease in the intergenerational sharing of environmental knowledge. Such findings suggest that local knowledge systems might not change at a rate quick enough to adapt to conditions of rapid ecosystem change, hence potentially compromising the adaptive success of the entire social-ecological system. With the current pace of Global Environmental Change, widening the gap between the temporal rates of on-going ecosystem change and the timescale needed for local knowledge systems to adjust to change, efforts to tackle the shifting baseline syndrome are urgent and critical for those who aim to use Local Environmental Knowledge as a tool for adaptive management.

abstract={How can a participatory approach to research promote environmental learning and enhance social-ecological systems resilience? Participatory action research (PAR) is an approach to research that its' supporters claim can foster new knowledge, learning, and action to support positive social and environmental change through reorienting the standard process of knowledge production. PAR is posited as being particularly suitable for use with historically disadvantaged groups. As such it may be a useful tool for environmental learning which would enable a social-ecological system to better respond to change as theorized by resilience thinkers. In this paper, we examine a PAR project to determine how PAR fostered environmental learning and, in turn, how the learning influenced resilience. The project partnered an ecologist, federal and state forest managers, and harvesters of salal (Gaultheria shallon), a non-timber forest product gathered and sold for use in the floral industry in the forests of the Olympic Peninsula, Washington, USA. Based on interviews with each group of partners during and after the PAR project, we found that the PAR approach did indeed generate environmental learning, defined here as ecological literacy, civic literacy, values awareness, and self-efficacy, and contributed to resiliency through promoting greater diversity, memory, redundancy, and adaptive capacity. However, the political vulnerability of the salal harvesters, who were largely undocumented Latino workers, inhibited the extent to which adaptive measures could be taken to revise permitting procedures and additional collaborative research. We conclude that the PAR approach is a valuable tool for environmental learning but the extent to which learning can actually promote system change and greater resilience must also be understood within the underlying context, especially political realities.},

volume={51},
number={5},
pages={1021-1032},
month={OCT},
abstract={As socio-ecological systems of high conservation value, sacred groves are subject to intense competing interests worldwide. Hong Kong's fung shui woodlands (FSW) are an ancient form of sacred grove derived from old-growth forest fragments protected for geomantic beliefs relating to their proximity to traditional villages and subsequently modified through planting, exploitation, and natural succession. Today, they contain approximately 30\% of the territory's native flora and are the only remaining localities for many rare plants, but inconsistent government policy and declining community involvement have led to mismatched expectations whereby biodiversity suffers by default. To identify common ground for better management, we interviewed residents of nine villages to quantify self-stated degree of connectedness and the relative importance of five shared social values in relation to the FSW at each location. One-third of respondents claimed no knowledge of the FSW in their village and more than two-thirds had never even visited it, but most expressed positive attachment particularly with respect to perceived health/social and historical/cultural value. Connectedness was a strong predictor of importance attributed to all values and was correlated with gender, education level, and protected status: women were significantly less connected with FSW than men, more educated respondents exhibited greater FSW connectedness, and residents at protected sites expressed greater connectedness than those at unprotected ones. Importance varied significantly with indigeneity and age group, but not species richness or conservation value. We infer that biodiversity could benefit from nuanced policy that promotes connectedness through emphasis of wider societal values.},

journal={REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE},
year={2021},
volume={21},
number={2},
pages={NA},
month={JUN},
abstract={Reindeer management (RM) in northern Fennoscandia is an example of social-ecological systems (SESs) providing social, cultural, ecological, and economic values. Changing climate and pasture conditions and societal changes continue to transform the operational environment of RM. These key drivers, and resulting transformations including alternative SES states, have not been studied in detail before. Our comprehensive literature review and interviews with herders reveal that land use, climate change, and governance drive the emergence of SES tipping points. The basis of successful RM depends on the quantity and quality of pastures to secure animal fitness. However, intensive forestry, extreme weather, and predators constrain the availability of forage and suitable calving grounds. Maintaining RM by means of predation compensation mechanisms and regular supplementary winter feeding to adapt to changes brought about by land use and warming climate comprises an alternative system state. However, if negative impacts increase remarkably or rapidly and compensatory mechanisms become insufficient, long-term impacts on system identity, and even local collapses, are expected. Although some environmental and societal changes are perceived as pressures by herders, they can be beneficial for other livelihoods in the region. Therefore, our study raises questions for future studies on social justice, such as who has the right to decide what constitutes a desirable system state, or what collaborative efforts to maintain RM in Fennoscandia would entail. Our work is applicable also in other Arctic/sub-Arctic regions where nature-based livelihoods, such as small-scale forestry and agriculture, hunting, traditional fishing, and gathering are practiced.},

month={DEC 15},
abstract={Conversion of tropical forests remains high on the international agenda, but the effectiveness of the proposed framework to reduce emissions from deforestation and degradation (REDD+) has been questioned. We hypothesized that an effective implementation of REDD+ would require understanding of the functioning of the local social-ecological system and modulation of actions to the actors' characteristics and motivations in the affected areas. But cross-scale studies of deforestation drivers are seldom performed, given the difficulties to obtain consistent datasets, particularly for the local scale. We addressed this issue for the agricultural expansion in the Central Basin of the Democratic Republic of Congo, a REDD+ priority country. We detected considerable variation in deforestation rate within scale levels, with highest variation at village and household level, which had gone unnoticed so far. Population density and market access are the main sources of inter- village variation, although cultural factors affect magnitude by an order of 2. Individual household contributions to deforestation are strongly unevenly distributed, with longer established households and better market integrated households deforesting more than others. Our results reveal that due to the current lack of cross-scale studies, policy makers are lacking context specific relevant information at local scale needed to design efficient, effective and equitable policies. They also challenge the dominant discourse that agricultural expansion in the Basin is driven by poor subsistence farmers, and make us add actor-oriented interventions and land use zoning as two crucial requirements for REDD+ intensification policies to become effective.

abstract={The Szekelyfold region of Transylvania, Romania is a unique social-ecological system and a traditional farming landscape with rich biological and cultural diversity. Commons institutions have ancient roots here, and are still prevalent today. In this paper, we attempt to give an overview of the traditional organisation, accelerating challenges, transformations and reorganisations of the Szekely commons over their history based on existing literature, covering the interval between the 16th and 21th centuries. Based on this overview, we also identify key drivers for resilience that counteracted dismantling forces, to account for the long persistence and transformability of these institutions. We found that between the end of the 16th and the mid-19th centuries, Szekely commons showed remarkable stability in their functioning based on village bylaws, and these documents also demonstrate that most communities could be characterised by Ostrom's design principles in this period. From the 19th century, the pressures of state centralisation, market integration, new technologies, population growth, polarisation and changing values intensified, creating significant dismantling forces. However. Szekely commons survived, and we argue that the harsh mountainous environment and isolation, coupled with locally rooted identity, worldview and a rich institutional memory, and also the traditional notions of equity and the widespread availability of common resources constituted elements of resilience, which helped to prevent dissolution. We conclude that as direct human-nature links lie at the heart of many of the identified drivers for resilience, nurturing these links seems essential for the survival of traditional local institutions and management practices that maintain biological and cultural diversity in a globalised world.},

pages={591-609},
month={NA},
abstract={In this contribution, we propose and explore the following hypothesis: civic ecology practices, including urban community forestry, community gardening, and other self-organized forms of stewardship of green spaces in cities, are manifestations of how memories of the role of greening in healing can be instrumentalized through social learning to foster social-ecological system (SES) resilience following crisis and disaster. Further, we propose that civic ecology communities of practice within and across cities help to leverage these memories into effective practices, and that these communities of practice serve as urban iterations of the collaborative and adaptive management practices that play a role in SES resilience in more rural settings. We present two urban examples to build support for this hypothesis: the Living Memorials Project in post-9/11 New York City, and community forestry in New Orleans following Hurricane Katrina. These cases demonstrate what we refer to as a memorialization mechanism that leads to feedbacks critical to SES resilience. The process begins immediately after a crisis, when a spontaneous and collective memorialization of lost ones through gardening and tree planting ensues, following which a community of practice emerges to act upon and apply these memories to social learning about greening practices. This in turn may lead to new kinds of learning, including about collective efficacy and ecosystem services production, through a kind of feedback between remembering, learning, and enhancing individual, social, and environmental well-being. This process, in the case of greening in cities, may confer SES resilience, through contributing to both psychological-social resistance and resilience and ecosystem benefits.},

title={A conceptual framework of urban forest ecosystem vulnerability},
journal={ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS},
year={2017},
volume={25},
number={1},
pages={115-126},
month={MAR},
abstract={The urban environment is becoming the most common setting in which people worldwide will spend their lives. Urban forests, and the ecosystem services they provide, are becoming a priority for municipalities. Quantifying and communicating the vulnerability of this resource are essential for maintaining a consistent and equitable supply of these ecosystem services. We propose a theory-based conceptual framework for the assessment of urban forest vulnerability that integrates the biophysical, built, and human components of urban forest ecosystems. A review and description of potential vulnerability indicators are provided. Urban forest vulnerability can be defined as the likelihood of decline in ecosystem service supply and its associated benefits for human populations, urban infrastructure, and biodiversity. It is comprised of (i) exposure, which refers to the stressors and disturbances associated with the urban environment that negatively affect ecosystem function, (ii) sensitivity, which is determined by urban forest structure and dictates the system response to forcing from exposures and the magnitude of potential impacts, and (iii) adaptive capacity, which is the social and environmental capacity of a system to shift or alter its conditions to reduce its vulnerability or to improve its ability to function while stressed. Potential impacts, or losses in ecosystem service supply, are temporal in nature and require backward-looking monitoring and (or) forward-looking modelling to be measured and assessed. Vulnerability can be communicated through the use of indicators, aggregated indices, and mapping. A vulnerability approach can communicate complex issues to decision-makers and advance the theoretical understanding of urban forest ecosystems.},

journal={REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE},
year={2023},
volume={23},
number={4},
pages={NA},
month={DEC},
abstract={A fundamental challenge is to understand and navigate trade-offs between ecosystem services (ES) in dynamic landscapes and to account for interactions between local people and broad-scale drivers, such as agricultural intensification. Many analyses of ES trade-offs rely on static mapping and biophysical indicators while disregarding the multiple uses, values, and desires for ES (UVD-ES) that local people associate with their changing landscapes. Here, a participatory UVD-ES framework was applied to assess differences in the use, values, and desire of ES between three zones with different land-use intensities (with pre-frontier, frontier, and post-frontier landscapes) in West Kalimantan (Indonesia). The analysis revealed that (1) almost the full suite of ES uses has become destabilized as a result of agricultural intensification; (2) ES more closely associated with agricultural intensification were largely desired by local people yet they still valued a diversity of traditional ES, such as those derived from the provision of non-timber forest products, fish, and other ES associated with non-material aspects including those tied to traditional culture; (3) the mismatch in used ES versus valued ES increased with agricultural intensification due to a decrease in the flow of non-timber forest products, aquatic, regulating, and non-material (cultural) ES. Together, exploring UVD-ES patterns in a participatory way helped to reveal locally relevant social-ecological drivers of ES and a multidimensional perspective of ES trade-offs. Our UVD-ES framework offers an opportunity to foster participation as a way to reconnect global environmental research agendas with local and regional landscape contexts.},

year={2019},

abstract={Managing complex social-ecological systems in an era of rapid climate change and changing human pressures represents a major challenge in sustainability science. The Sierra Nevada, USA is a large social-ecological system facing a tipping point that could result in major ecosystem changes. A century of fire suppression and climate change have set the stage for mega-disturbances that threaten biodiversity, human life and values, ecosystem services, and forest persistence. Stakeholders face multidimensional and often contentious trade-offs with costs and benefits that can be mismatched in space and time. If compromises cannot be reached, the status quo is likely to continue, resulting in the conversion of large portions of a 100 000 km(2) predominately mixed-conifer forest ecosystem to a chaparral-dominated ecosystem. We describe the outcomes of a continuation of the ecological status quo on biodiversity, cultural history, fire management, recreational value, and climate control, including indirect effects on water and food security and recreation. The social-ecological ramifications of such a future are undesirable for most stakeholders. Therefore, we contend that forest management conflicts should be framed in terms of the cost of failure of negotiations among stakeholders. Specifically, negotiations may benefit from (1) stakeholders quantifying their definitions of success and failure, (2) quantification of trade-offs and recognition of their multidimensionality, and (3) allowing for solutions that are heterogeneous in space and time. This approach may help stakeholders navigate the wicked problem of managing Sierra Nevada forests and other complex social-ecological systems.},

volume={237},

pages={308-316},

abstract={Most spatial conservation prioritisations being implemented across the globe are based on static approaches to conservation planning. These use snapshots of systems to support decision-making. However, ignoring the dynamic nature of systems can result in misleading spatial prioritisations and missed opportunities to encourage participation in conservation programmes. Using a modelling approach, we show that integrating economic and ecological feedbacks into conservation planning improved social and ecological outcomes. We developed an approach that enabled accounting for feedbacks of farmland set-asides using a popular conservation planning tool. We empirically assessed the impact of ignoring feedbacks on plans to restore the Brazilian Atlantic Forest by comparing outcomes of our approach and a widely used static approach. The proposed approach attained better conservation outcomes than a static approach, at about 7\% lower cost, while also allowing more farmers to benefit economically from the set-aside scheme through capitalising on the differences between their opportunity costs and the amount paid by the scheme. Accounting for feedbacks led to substantially different areas being prioritised for farmland set-asides, and to more farmers being included in the set-aside scheme. These results show important benefits from understanding, and then working with, feedbacks that inevitably accompany large-scale conservation interventions. Our approach is the first to integrate both environmental and economic feedbacks into spatial conservation planning, and model information rent capture. In doing so, it demonstrates how existing economic incentives can be used to encourage farmers to join a conservation set-aside, while still resulting in a lower overall intervention cost.},

abstract={1. The idea that human impacts on natural systems might trigger large-scale, social-ecological `crises' or `breakdowns' is attracting increasing scientific, societal and political attention, but the risks of such crises remain hard to assess or ameliorate. 2. Social-ecological systems have complex dynamics, with bifurcations, nonlinearities and tipping points all emerging from the interaction of multiple human and natural processes. Computational modelling is a key tool in understanding these processes and their effects on system resilience. However, models that operate over large geographical extents often rely on assumptions such as economic equilibrium and optimisation in social-economic systems, and mean-field or trend-based behaviour in ecological systems, which limit the simulation of crisis dynamics. 3. Alternative forms of modelling focus on simulating local-scale processes that underpin the dynamics of social-ecological systems. Recent improvements in data resources and computational tools mean that such modelling is now technically feasible across large geographical extents. 4. We consider the contributions that the different types of model can make to simulating social-ecological crises. While no models are able to predict exact outcomes in complex social-ecological systems, we suggest that one new approach with substantial promise is hybrid modelling that uses existing model architectures to isolate and understand key processes, revealing risks and associated uncertainties of crises emerging. We outline convergent and efficient functional descriptions of social and ecological systems that can be used to develop such models, data resources that can support them, and possible `high-level' processes that they can represent.},

month={NOV},
abstract={Context Landscape sustainability emerges from interactions between linked human and natural systems. Many of these interactions are mediated by institutions (e.g., rules, laws, customs, traditions), most of which are themselves spatially defined entities that both generate and respond to spatial variation in the landscape. However, the spatial dynamics of the interplay between institutions and landscape heterogeneity are poorly understood. Objective To define the landscape ecology of institutions as an emerging research field, providing a summary of key themes and frontiers. Methods We draw on existing theory in both landscape ecology and institutional analysis to explore the interface between landscape ecology and institutions in social-ecological systems. Results Three central themes in understanding landscape sustainability through an institutional lens include the role of landscape heterogeneity as a driver of institutions; the spatial properties of institutions as influences on ecological and socioeconomic processes; and the relationships between institutions and landscape resilience. Emerging frontiers for further research include understanding the roles of top-down vs bottom up processes (design vs. emergence); understanding landscapes as institutional filters; the role of landscapes in institutional development and change; and co-evolutionary dynamics between landscapes and institutions. We discuss each of these points in detail. Conclusions Spatially mediated feedbacks between landscape structure and institutions are poorly understood and critical for landscape sustainability. Further research in this area will depend heavily on generating data sets that describe the spatial properties of institutions and allow them to be analysed as landscape features.},

pages={887-901},
month={OCT},
abstract={Urban forests have garnered increasing attention as providers of an array of beneficial ecosystem services. However, urban forest ecosystems are highly complex and heterogeneous systems whose structure are shaped by interacting social and ecological processes. Approaches to reliably identify and differentiate these processes could be valuable for addressing complexity and reducing uncertainty in decision-making in urban forestry. The purpose of this study is to identify and quantify a range of social and ecological drivers of urban forest species composition, distribution, and diversity. This was done using hierarchical cluster analysis and discriminant analysis with empirical plot data describing the tree species composition in Toronto, Canada. Tree density and imperviousness were by far the most influential drivers of species composition. Increasing imperviousness saw not just reduced tree density but a decline in native species abundance. Additionally, single-detached housing, homeownership, and income were closely associated and explained higher tree densities and abundances of native species. However, income had a lower than expected influence on urban forest species composition given its importance in canopy cover research. Continuous forest patches were highly distinct compared to the remainder of the urban landscape, which highlights the ecological distinctiveness of residual forests within cities and lends support to their conservation. Increasing the understanding of social and ecological drivers of tree species composition, distribution, and diversity within cities is an integral part of urban forest ecosystem classification, which can be a valuable decision-support tool for ecosystem-based management in urban forestry.},

abstract={The food-biodiversity nexus is a concept that defines and characterizes the complex interactions between agricultural systems and biodiversity conservation. Here we use a social-ecological systems approach that combines fuzzy cognitive mapping and graph theoretic analyses to uncover system properties that determine food security and biodiversity outcomes at a landscape scale. We studied a rice-based agricultural landscape system situated in Mbeliling district of West Flores, Indonesia. A graphical representation of the Mbeliling district food-biodiversity nexus was created by local experts. The representation revealed system properties that help reconcile the trade-offs between food security and biodiversity conservation. The graph represented a diverse set of food security and biodiversity nodes, and showed that there is not a simple dichotomy between `production and protection'. The analysis captured greater complexity than popular academic concepts such as land sparing-land sharing or sustainable intensification. Three major themes emerged from the graph. We found distinct clusters of factors influencing biodiversity and food security. We named these sources of influence (1) Modernisation and sustainable farming; (2) Knowledge and management; and (3) Governance and processes. Component 2 was the most representative of emergent system properties that contribute positively to managing a sustainable food-biodiversity nexus in the Mbeliling landscape. The key determinants of outcomes were: improving agronomic practices, diversifying production, maintaining forest cover and connectivity, and using knowledge and natural resource management processes to mitigate the main drivers of change. Our approach highlights the complexities in the food-biodiversity nexus, and could have wide application in other locations.},

journal={JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY},

number={NA},
pages={NA},
month={JUN 7},
abstract={Stochasticity is often associated with negative consequences for population dynamics since a population may die out due to random chance during periods when population size is very low (stochastic fade-out). Here we develop a coupled social-ecological model based on stochastic differential equations that includes natural expansion and harvesting of a forest ecosystem, and dynamics of conservation opinions, social norms and social learning in a human population. Our objective was to identify mechanisms that influence long-term persistence of the forest ecosystem in the presence of noise. We found that most of the model parameters had a significant influence on the time to extinction of the forest ecosystem. Increasing the social learning rate and the net benefits of conservation significantly increased the time to extinction, for instance. Most interestingly, we found a parameter regime where an increase in the amount of system stochasticity caused an increase in the mean time to extinction, instead of causing stochastic fade-out. This effect occurs for a subset of realizations, but the effect is large enough to increase the mean time to extinction across all realizations. Such ``stochasticity-induced persistence{''} occurs when stochastic dynamics in the social system generates benefits in the forest system at crucial points in its temporal dynamics. We conclude that studying relatively simple social-ecological models has the benefit of facilitating characterization of dynamical states and thereby enabling us to formulate new hypothesis about mechanisms that could be operating in empirical social-ecological systems.

month={NA},
abstract={We provide a cartography of 319 bioeconomic models applied to terrestrial habitats by combining a quantitative analysis of methodological criteria and the narratives underlying the equations. Based on a multiple correspondence analysis and clustering techniques, our cartography is organized in four groups. Two of them adopt a conservation perspective: while the first one focuses on how to efficiently preserve species given a limited budget through a cost-effectiveness approach without any biodiversity monetarization, the second one stands for a second generation of models tackling habitat-based conservation measures with specific applications in agriculture and forestry. The last two groups are concerned with the notion of harvesting. Biodiversity is here monetized and the problem is framed as the maximization of the utility of agents derived from the flow of the biodiversity variable raising thus a cost-benefit problem. While the notion of harvesting is mostly applied to endangered species and invasive species in one group, a specific interest for forestry characterizes the second one. The temporal analysis of the database shows that bioeconomic models applied to terrestrial social-ecological systems exhibit an overall recent and ongoing decline. We discuss this result regarding the neighboring methods, especially the correlative and datadriven models. Since a diversity of modeling frameworks is needed to investigate the management of social-ecological systems, especially to embrace different understandings and decrease uncertainty, we provide some challenges for the future of mathematically based bioeconomic models.},

abstract={We review evidence of Holocene climate, vegetation, and cultural changes in Mongolia and critically examine evidence that Mongolia's steppes are at the brink of ecological and cultural tipping points in the Anthropocene. Until 5,000 YBP there is no evidence of lasting human influences on ecosystems, but after this time, changes in vegetation and soil physical properties signal domestic livestock grazing impacts on steppe ecosystems. Contemporary (1991-2015) literature and region by region analysis of climate, livestock, remotesensing and human population data reveal two potential tipping points. Temperatures warmed across the 5 regions. Since 1991, livestock densities and forage use increased in most regions, the spatial distribution of grazing pressure is more heterogeneous, and variability increased in stocking densities, forage use and forage production in all or most regions. Substantial plant species shifts and losses occurred in the mountain and forest steppe regions. Although a large proportion of Mongolia's rangelands are altered from their ecological potential, few have crossed an irreversible threshold of ecological change. Rangelands in Mongolia's Khangai, northern and central regions may be approaching an ecological tipping point if grazing pressure is not reduced. After 1991, herder populations initially rose and then decreased significantly across most regions. If demographic and social trends contribute to loss of herding knowledge and identity, a cultural tipping point could occur. We describe four potential future scenarios that could unfold if these tipping points are reached, hypothesize feedbacks between ecological and cultural thresholds, and discuss implications for policy and management.

abstract={Context Human-dominated landscapes in the tropics need to be managed for biodiversity and the maintenance of ecosystem services (ES). Nevertheless, integrating both biodiversity conservation and ES management remains a challenge. Objectives This study aimed to quantify woody plant species diversity and associated ES in farmland and forests, and investigate the relationship between species and ES diversity. Methods The study was conducted in southwestern Ethiopia. We surveyed woody plants in 181 20 m by 20 m plots in farmland, forest with, and forest without coffee management. We also interviewed 180 randomly selected households about woody plant benefits. We then (a) quantified species and ES diversity; and (b) investigated the relationship between species and ES diversity. Results We recorded 128 woody plant species in total. Most ES were available in all land uses, although they differed in their mean availability. ES composition was significantly different among land uses. ES diversity was positively related with species diversity in all land uses. Conclusions Our findings suggest that all examined land-use types were multifunctional in terms of key ES provided by woody plants and that maintaining high species diversity also benefits ES diversity. Given these findings, we suggest to: (1) strengthen landscape multifunctionality by drawing on the positive relationship between biodiversity and ES diversity; (2) devise conservation policies that encompass entire landscape mosaics and enhance co-benefits of conservation and ES provision across land uses; and (3) conduct further social-ecological studies that use mixed data to elicit socially relevant relationships between biodiversity and ES diversity.},

abstract={Urban Tree Canopy (UTC) greatly enhances the livability of cities by reducing urban heat buildup, mitigating stormwater runoff, and filtering airborne particulates, among other ecological services. These benefits, combined with the relative ease of measuring tree cover from aerial imagery, have led many cities to adopt management strategies based on UTC goals. In this study, we conducted canopy analyses for 300 cities in Florida to assess the impacts of development practices, urban forest ordinances, and hurricanes on tree cover. Within the cities sampled, UTC ranged from 5.9 to 68.7\% with a median canopy coverage of 32.3\% Our results indicate that the peak gust speeds recorded during past hurricanes events were a significant predictor of canopy coverage (P = 0.001) across the sampled cities. As peak gust speeds increased from 152 km/h (i.e., a lower-intensity Category 1 storm) to 225 km/h (lower-intensity Category 4 and the maximum gusts captured in our data), predicted canopy in developed urban areas decreased by 7.7\%. Beyond the impacts of hurricanes and tropical storms, we found that historic landcover and two out of eight urban forest ordinances were significant predictors of existing canopy coverage (P-landcover < 0.001; P-tree preservation ordinance = 0.02, P-heritage tree ordinance = 0.03). Results indicate that some local policies and tree protections can potentially impact urban tree canopy, even in the face of rapid development and periodic natural disturbances.},

abstract={Indigenous Peoples' protected and conserved areas have gained global attention due to growing interest in protecting biodiversity during a time of Indigenous resurgence. We reviewed the academic literature to synthesize the motivations, successes, challenges, and lessons from protected and conserved areas led by Indigenous Peoples globally. We found and analyzed 58 papers, describing 86 specific initiatives involving at least 68 Indigenous Peoples across 25 countries. We found that Indigenous Peoples established protected and conserved areas independently and through local- and broad-scale partnerships. States that supported such efforts did so through formal legislation, agreements, and policies, and informally through local relationships and shared values. Indigenous Peoples' protected and conserved areas created socio-cultural, political, and ecological benefits such as improving Indigenous livelihoods, increasing governance and management capacities, and improving species populations and habitat protection. However, some challenges (e.g. restrictive legislations, burdensome partnerships, insufficient funding) limited benefits, and demanded additional capacities and resources for mitigation. We recommend that states and other external actors: create and improve policies, legislations, and resources for Indigenous Peoples' protected and conserved areas as defined by Indigenous Peoples; provide resources and facilitate Indigenous leadership to shape external mechanisms for protected area establishment and development; and create new internal mechanisms for Indigenous engagement and partnerships. Indigenous Peoples would benefit from building partnerships to support and manage their areas. Finally, we suggest that managers commit more resources to effectively monitor and manage these areas, including integrating management priorities with local and larger scale socio-cultural and environmental issues that affect these areas.},

abstract={Designing policies for the sustainable development of social-ecological systems with complex human-land relations requires integrated management and nexus thinking; China's national parks are typical social-ecological systems. Ecosystem services and community livelihood are two essential components of sustainable management in the nature-community nexus (NCN). This study focuses on the Qianjiangyuan National Park Pilot Area in eastern China. Following a systems approach and integrating qualitative (causal analysis and systems but dynamic methods) and quantitative (InVEST model, Spearman's correlation analysis, regression analysis, and multiple correspondence analysis) methods, we developed two causal mechanisms linking livelihood assets and ecosystem services, and verified them by exploring multi-dimensional linkages and revealing two types of NCNs. Results showed that the proportions of cropland and orchard areas have significant negative correlations with water and soil retention services, respectively, while forests significantly benefit both services. A positive NCN exists in areas where water and soil retention services perform well and the local community develops vibrantly with a considerable proportion of young, highly educated, or high-income (especially the income from secondary industries) residents. A negative NCN is seen in areas where the water and soil retention services values are low; a great many households do not have substantial income from secondary and tertiary industries, and few households have vast forest areas. These results can be used as scientific evidence for optimizing institutional arrangements and contributing to sustainable and harmonious development of national parks in China.},

abstract={Community-based forest management takes myriad forms, including community forestry, urban and community forestry, and joint forest management. These variations are all implemented with a promise to include local communities (to varying degrees) in forest decision-making and management, but distinctions are often made between rural versus urban focused research and practice. Such distinctions may be arbitrary and increasingly unnecessary, as rural and urban communities exist on a continuum. To understand whether there is a measurable divide between urban and rural community forestry scholarship, we conduct a systematic bibliometric analysis including examining co-citation networks, citation counts, and keywords. We find there is a multi-dimensional divide between the scholars studying community-based forestry in rural and urban focused contexts, including in terms of discipline, topics of focus, and the intellectual foundations of each community. The separation we find between urban and rural community-based forest research represents an opportunity to explore where researchers and practitioners typically isolated in rural or urban research may learn from and connect with each other. Ultimately, we argue that community-based forestry cannot achieve its potential to improve forests and reduce inequality without increased connections between scholars and practitioners from the often siloed rural and urban communities. Connecting these communities will require increased collaboration between natural and social scientists and increased attention to the research needs of practitioners and local communities, which we argue may help facilitate more just forest governance.},

title={Ecosystem-based management revisited: Updating the concepts for urban forests},
journal={LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING},
year={2019},
volume={186},
number={NA},
pages={24-35},
month={JUN},
abstract={The concept of ecosystem-based management (EBM) emerged from growing concern around adverse environmental impacts associated with resource management in the late twentieth century. Despite inconsistencies and ambiguities in both definition and implementation, the concept has seen considerable uptake in federal and provincial/state policies. More recently, municipal urban forest plans and programs have been making reference to EBM, yet there is almost no existing research on EBM in urban settings. In this paper, we discuss EBM in the context of urban forest ecosystems. Specifically, we ask three questions: (1) how might the concept of EBM remain relevant and be applied in densely-populated urban settings; (2) what structure and form might EBM take in the management of urban forest ecosystems; and (3) what are some examples of EBM applications in municipal urban forestry? The review is structured around 10 prominent themes from the EBM literature, which are re-negotiated for the urban context and, where necessary, are altered, omitted, or replaced with new themes. We also draw from four complementary cases of EBM in practice in Halifax, Toronto, and Edmonton. The resulting 12 themes of urban forest EBM include: Resilience, hierarchical context, social-ecological boundaries, data and information management, monitoring, adaptive management, interagency cooperation, partnerships and civic engagement, organizational change, social change, environmental justice, and values. Urban forests are important ecosystem service providers, but managers face a host of challenges, ranging from a consistent lack of resources to degraded urban sites. Continued dialogue on best approaches for integrating ecological principles into management is essential.},

abstract={Mangroves in Northwestern Mexico are vital to maintain coastal environments healthy, to provide nutrients for several food chains, and to supply valuable goods and services that sustain and improve human livelihoods. Many of these values offer a range of opportunities for economic development that attract workers, investors and developers. Recently, federal privatization policies have promoted an accelerated coastal development of this region to obtain large profits in short times, creating competing and overlapping interests to use coastal environments and control key resources. Such intense developments are modifying the ecological conditions of many coastal areas, threatening the provision of important ecosystem services to society. After years of centralized decisions, new paradigms are needed to achieve a coastal management that ensures long-term ecosystem maintenance, fair resource use and social equity. Recognizing the multiplicity of actors involved in coastal management and using a qualitative research methodology, we identified and explored the perspectives of different key stakeholders in the states of Baja California Sur and Sonora, Mexico, to better understand their views on mangroves use and management as well as the interaction among them. We discuss similarities and/or discrepancies found among stakeholders' perceptions by describing their central ideas and identifying overlapping interests that may create conflicts when defining development and conservation programs or formulating policies. This information also intends to encourage further research on the social-ecological system of the coasts in Northwestern Mexico and to contribute to address coastal management issues in integrated ways that consider the social dimension through documenting stakeholders' narratives in the future.

journal={FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE},
year={2019},
volume={7},
number={NA},
pages={NA},
month={JUL 4},
abstract={In the Mediterranean region, and in other fire-prone areas of the globe, human and economic losses due to forest fires have increased in the past decades, particularly at the urban-wildland interface. To counter this trend, economic and human resources are generally invested to combat and suppress wildfires, with much less invested to adapt through ecosystem-based management. Ecosystem services for fire regulation are rarely accounted for in the literature and are generally excluded from ecosystem service classifications. This gap causes fire-regulating services to be overlooked in socio-ecological assessments and in economic valuations, potentially further hampering the design and implementation of ecosystem-based approaches. We review the literature on fire risk reduction related to ecosystem management to define and characterize fire-regulating services and disservices. We then suggest indicators for the assessment of these services and disservices, and we propose a conceptual framework linking fire risk, ecosystem services, and ecosystem management practices. In the second part of the paper, we apply these concepts to the historical development of the social-ecological system of the Haifa-Mount Carmel region in Israel, including pre- and post-fire forest management practices. To inform the case study we investigate reports, relevant scientific articles, and policy documents, all corroborated with information from expert lectures on the topic. We conclude by suggesting that human capital should become an integral part of the description and definition of fire-regulating services and disservices, especially for highly modified urban and peri-urban environments.},

journal={ELEMENTA-SCIENCE OF THE ANTHROPOCENE},
year={2023},
volume={11},

month={NOV 9},
abstract={Agroforestry has a high potential to contribute to climate change mitigation and adaptation as a nature-based climate solution and is increasingly included as a climate strategy in international agreements and national plans. Yet, how to equitably increase and sustain agroforestry on the scale needed to meet these targets remains unclear. Examining broad trends in the existing 4 decades of agroforestry literature can highlight gaps and opportunities for future research that enables agroforestry transitions. Using text analytics and a full-text, corpus-based approach, we analyzed changes in word use in 9,664 agroforestry research articles and reports published between 1980 and 2020 with regard to 4 key themes of the social dimensions of agroforestry transitions: (1) agreements and policies; (2) scales and decision-making agents; (3) knowledge, culture, and equity; and (4) frameworks and methods. We then compared the frequency of these themes in research articles and reports. Despite the most frequently used terms across all 4 decades being primarily ecological (e.g., forest, species, soil), the lexicon of agroforestry literature has expanded to incorporate more social, economic, and political elements (e.g., livelihood, knowledge, community) over time, and as agroforestry has become more central to climate change adaptation and mitigation targets. Trends in the frequency of several terms (e.g., biodiversity, development, climate) corresponded with the signing of intergovernmental agreements, illustrating the responsiveness of the field to global priorities. Reports had a higher frequency of terms related to social themes than research articles. We discuss the implications of these emergent trends and opportunities for future research in support of sustainable and just agroforestry transitions.},

journal={JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},

volume={354},
number={NA},
pages={NA},
month={MAR},
abstract={Managers need to trace social impacts and vulnerability caused by environmental change all the way to its driving forces to target key system components for intervention. However, most available scientific evidence deals with either the ecological impacts of direct drivers or the value of ecosystem benefits to people. Our matrixbased tool combines these types of evidence to make environmental management problems traceable through a structured yet flexible procedure. The tool consists of a series of matrices that sequentially link direct drivers of environmental change, landscapes, ecological conditions, benefits to people, and stakeholder types. Qualitative matrices result from the integration and synthesis of available evidence from literature reviews, and where data is scarce, these are used to elicit quantitative scores from expert opinion. Expert scoring of links and multiplication of matrices allow for estimating the impacts of each driver of environmental change on each stakeholder type and using this information as input to assess stakeholders' vulnerability through impact -influence diagrams. Applying the tool to the Argentine Gran Chaco, a globally threatened ecoregion, yielded a transparent and reliable picture of this data-scarce place, with important management implications. Tracing stakeholder impacts back to direct drivers confirmed that further encroachment of cleared areas around indigenous lands will increase the vulnerability of this social group. Also, assessing confidence levels for every social-ecological link suggested that incentivizing peasant farmers to restore natural forage supply represents a management opportunity to reverse degradation. Our tool makes interdisciplinary frameworks of linked ecological and social systems operational so managers can use the best available knowledge of a place and account for uncertainty to make environmental management decisions.},

month={APR 1},
abstract={Extensive calls for increased tree planning worldwide are highlighting the need for management changes in the field tree nursery sector. Healthy soil is the foundation for sustainable agricultural systems, and best practices for soil management confer tangible benefits to producers as well as broader system-wide benefits. However, field tree producers lack the foundational resources needed to implement, manage, and evaluate soil health practices within their operations. Furthermore, tree producers are unique in that their primary product is central to the sustainable development of urban spaces and are facing increased demand for high-quality trees. There is sub-sequently a two-pronged need. First, a greater understanding of the key objectives, opportunities, and challenges driving soil management in tree production is required to support the development of specified practices, within the sector. Second, a greater characterization of the short-and long-term value of trees is required to incentivize the soil health practices that will support resilience in tree production systems. The study characterizes the soil health and management practices implemented in Ontario by field tree nursery producers. A questionnaire was administered in the summer of 2020 to Ontario tree nursery producers within the Landscape Ontario Horti-cultural Trades Association (N = 29). Responding producers provided insight into soil management practices, opportunities and challenges. Tree nursery producers expressed a need for resources to support cover crop usage and comprehensive soil testing to improve tree performance. Reflection on current soil management challenges and opportunities highlights the benefits of considering soil management as one aspect within the broader social -ecological system.},

month={APR 15},
abstract={Global change is shaping social-ecological systems, threatening both natural and socio-economic ecosystems as a whole. Landscapes with combined nature-human interactions are particularly vulnerable to changing climatic conditions. Therefore, there is a need to find viable and practical solutions for the preservation and recovery of the affected systems. A relevant way to cope with disturbances is to promote social-ecological resilience through the use of strategies targeting the social-ecological system as a whole, in order to ensure an efficient self-reorganization of a landscape. This study presents a research innovation by clarifying the concept of social-ecological resilience while being focused on providing a useful tool for landscape managers. For doing so, the research first defines social-ecological resilience and aims to give a clear idea of its characteristics and application features. Second, it explains the importance of social-ecological resilience for landscapes, focusing on the relationship of humans with nature and traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) for biodiversity conservation. Third, it proposes guidelines and measures for the promotion and enhancement of social-ecological resilience. The outcomes of the study show a broad perspective on the concept of social-ecological resilience to understand the necessary adaptation to global change. As findings, this research highlights the significance of nature-human interactions for agroforestry systems, citing also the potential contribution that digital innovation can play for the conservation of those interactions in a sustainable way. Moreover, it uncovers the key role of local communities in building social-ecological resilience through the application of a variety of described strategies that can have a relevant impact and be useful for landscape management practices to face upcoming challenges linked to climate change.},

abstract={The critical impact of humans on the biosphere has led scientists to coin the term Anthropocene. The global environmental changes associated with it are happening under the aegis of capitalism. A transition towards sustainability requires a critical scrutiny of capitalism. The social-ecological system (SES) approach conceptualises the relationship between the socio-economic subsystem and the biosphere. However, in its various operationalisations it either treats the former as a black box or it fails to capture dynamic aspects. We address these limits and develop a Dialectical Socio-Ecological System (D-SES) framework, which combines process ecology with historical materialism, to describe the emergence and persistence of capitalist dynamics. We draw on data collected through fieldwork and desk research and deploy our framework to study capital-intensive agriculture in the Chaco Salteno, an important agricultural frontier in South America, obtaining some general insights. We open up the socio-economic subsystem and break it down into a lower-level material/economic sphere and an upper-level cultural/institutional sphere. Capitalist dynamics emerge out of the peculiar relationships occurring both within and between these spheres. This configuration shows the typical signs of autocatalysis. It attracts resources and capital to expand itself (centripetality). It becomes more complex and organised over time, fine-tuning production modes, cultures, and institutions (directionality). It is subject to the laws of competition and profit maximisation, which emerge independently from the individual actors and processes making up the system (autonomy). Finally, it engenders frictions, reflecting class antagonism between the direct producers and the appropriators of wealth. These frictions can become leverage points for a system's transformation.},

title={Comparison between best-response dynamics and replicator dynamics in a social-ecological model of lake eutrophication},

year={2021},
volume={509},

month={JAN 21},
abstract={Social-ecological models are often used to investigate the mutual interactions between an ecological system and human behaviour at a collective level. The social system is widely represented either by the replicator dynamics or by the best-response dynamics. We investigate the consequences of choosing one or the other with the example of a social-ecological model for eutrophication in shallow lakes, where the anthropogenic discharge of pollutants into the water is determined by a behavioural model using the replicator or a best-response dynamics. We discuss a fundamental difference between the replicator dynamics and the logit formulation of the best-response dynamics. This fundamental difference results in a different number of equilibria. We show that the replicator equation is a limit case of the best-response model, when agents are assumed to behave with infinite rationality. If agents act less rationally in the model using the best-response dynamics, the correspondence with the model using the replicator dynamics decreases. Finally, we show that sustained oscillations observed in both cases may differ substantially. The replicator dynamics makes the amplitude of the limit cycle become larger and makes the system come closer to full cooperation or full defection. Thus, the dynamics along the limit cycle imply a different risk for the system to be pushed by a perturbation into a desirable or an undesirable outcome depending on the socioeconomic dynamics assumed in the model. When analyzing social-ecological models, the choice of a socioeconomic dynamics is often little justified but our results show that it may have dramatic impacts on the coupled human-environment system.

volume={165},
number={NA},
pages={115-127},
month={SEP},
abstract={Climate change is one of the significant concerns in land and resource management, creating an urgent need to build social-ecological capacity to address widespread and uncertain environmental changes. Given the diversity and complexity of ecological responses to climate change ``ecosystem management{''} approaches are needed to provide solutions for meeting both ecological and human needs, while reducing anthropogenic warming and climate-related impacts on society. For instance, ecosystem management can contribute to a reduction in the greenhouse gas emissions through improved land-use and reduced deforestation at a regional scale. Further, conserving and restoring naturally-functioning ecosystems, which is often one of the goals of ecosystem management can significantly contribute to buffering ecological responses to climate extremes such as droughts and wildfires. Moreover, ecosystem management helps build capacity for learning and adaptation at multiple scales. As a result, societies will be better prepared to respond to surprises and uncertainties associated with climate change. In this regard, it is imperative to reframe climate change issues based on the ecosystem approach. Although climate change and ecosystem management plans have largely developed independently, it is now essential for all stakeholders to work together to achieve multiple goals. The ecosystem-based approaches can enable flexible and effective responses to the uncertainties associated with climate change. Reframing ecosystem management helps to face an urgent need for reconsideration and improvement of social-ecological resilience in order to mitigate and adapt to the changing climate.

year={2020},
volume={25},

month={SEP},
abstract={Social-ecological systems are complex and involve uncertainties emerging from interactions between biophysical and social system components. In the face of growing complexity and uncertainty, stakeholder engagement with the future is important to proactively manoeuvre toward desirable outcomes. Focusing on the interrelated challenges of food security and biodiversity conservation, we conducted a participatory scenario planning exercise in a rural landscape in southwestern Ethiopia. We involved 35 stakeholder organizations in multiple workshops to construct causal loop diagrams, elicit critical uncertainties, and draft scenario narratives. Jointly, we developed four plausible future scenarios for the studied landscape: (1) gain over grain: local cash crops; (2) mining green gold: coffee investors; (3) coffee and conservation: a biosphere reserve; and (4) food first: intensive farming and forest protection. These scenarios differ with respect to their main social-economic dynamics as well as their food security and biodiversity outcomes. Importantly, three of the four scenarios, i.e., all except ``coffee and conservation: a biosphere reserve,{''} focused on increasing efficiency in agricultural production through intensification, specialization, and market integration. In contrast, ``coffee and conservation: a biosphere reserve{''} was driven by agroecological production methods that support diversified livelihoods, a multifunctional landscape, maintenance of natural capital, a governance system that supports local people, and social-ecological resilience. Similar agroecological trajectories have been advocated as desirable for sustainable development in numerous other smallholder farming systems worldwide. Given fewer trade-offs and better equity outcomes, it appears that an agroecological development pathway stands a good chance of generating synergies between food security and biodiversity conservation. Pathways prioritizing agricultural efficiency, in contrast, are more likely to degrade natural capital and cause social inequity.},

journal={ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
year={2014},
volume={19},
number={4},
pages={NA},
month={NA},
abstract={Wild edible plants (WEPs) are known to make important contributions to food baskets and livelihoods in the smallholder and subsistence farming communities of sub-Saharan Africa. As a result, protecting and promoting the sustainable use of WEPs in concert with more mainstream agricultural innovation efforts has the potential to build household resilience to food insecurity. There is, however, a need to better understand how WEPs contribute to rural livelihoods on a daily basis and act as emergency safety nets during periods of hunger. Focusing on two villages in rural eastern Kenya, we sought to determine which household conditions are correlated with household reliance on WEPs as a coping strategy during times of food insecurity, while also investigating the role of access restrictions on adaptive capacity and the ability to obtain these important food resources. Results reveal that reliance on WEPs is greater in households that report food insecurity, lack off-farm income, and have lower asset levels. Access to WEPs is also a major factor in consumption frequency, with smaller farm sizes and increased distance to harvest areas significantly correlated with lower levels of WEP use. By combining vulnerability and adaptive capacity measures for each household, we created a more complete accounting of the factors that influence WEP consumption frequency, with implications for policy. This study represents an important first step in taking a more holistic view of the subsistence value of WEPs and the myriad factors that influence households' reliance on, and ability to obtain, uncultivated natural resources.},

title={An integrated approach to prioritize restoration for carnivore conservation in shared landscapes},

year={2022},
volume={273},
number={NA},
pages={NA},
month={SEP},
abstract={Global land use change has resulted in the loss and fragmentation of habitats and amplified the pace of species extinction. With carnivores being disproportionately at risk of range contraction, restoration is an important strategy to counter the impacts of habitat loss and fragmentation. While protection of public lands has been the cornerstone of conservation, private lands can play an important supplementary role. India harbors 23 \% of the global carnivore species, threatened by a rapidly growing economy and high human densities. Using a socialecological systems approach, we prioritized private agricultural lands for agroforestry in the buffer area of Pench Tiger Reserve. We applied systematic conservation planning tools and combined data on (1) habitat use of four carnivores (tiger, leopard, dhole, and sloth bear), (2) landowner willingness to modify land use through enrolment in an incentive-based program, and (3) monetary cost of program implementation, to identify priority areas for agroforestry based on their relative cost-effectiveness. Our integrated approach generated a configuration of priority areas that was markedly different than if we selected areas using ecological data only. Over an 8-year period, restoration of similar to 4900, similar to 8300 and similar to 12,000 acres through agroforestry was estimated to have a cumulative cost of USD 56 million, USD 95 million, and USD 140 million, respectively. Partnering with and incentivizing private landowners can expand the effective size of small and fragmented protected areas. Our approach can be applied to other shared landscapes, dominated by private ownership, to identify areas that deliver a compromise between ecological suitability, social acceptability, and economic viability.},

abstract={We present a social-ecological framework to provide insight into climate adaptation strategies and diverse perspectives on interventions in protected areas for species experiencing climate-induced impacts. To develop this framework, we examined the current ecological condition of a culturally and commercially valuable species, considered the predicted future effects of climate change on that species in a protected area, and assessed the perspectives held by forest users and managers on future adaptive practices. We mapped the distribution of yellow-cedar (Callitropsis nootkatensis) and examined its health status in Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve by comparing forest structure, tree stress-indicators, and associated thermal regimes between forests inside the park and forests at the current latitudinal limit of the species dieback. Yellow-cedar trees inside the park were healthy and relatively unstressed compared to trees outside the park that exhibited reduced crown fullness and increased foliar damage. Considering risk factors for mortality under future climate scenarios, our vulnerability model indicated future expected dieback occurring within park boundaries. Interviews with forest users and managers revealed strong support for increasing monitoring to inform interventions outside protected areas, improving management collaboration across land designations, and using a portfolio of interventions on actively managed lands. Study participants who perceived humans as separate from nature were more opposed to interventions in protected areas. Linking social and ecological analyses, our study provides an interdisciplinary approach to identify system-specific metrics (e.g., stress indicators) that can better connect monitoring with management, and adaptation strategies for species impacted by climate change.

abstract={Maintenance of socio-cultural values and biodiversity at local and regional levels are new important additional criteria for the implementation of sustainable forest management. Ukraine's forest sector is in transition from planned socialist to market economy. We evaluated the role of the traditional village system, which was successful for centuries for achieving both common economic as well as these new dimensions of sustainable forest management in Ukraine's Carpathian Mountains. We used the Skole district as a case study that represents one of the most forested areas in Ukraine, and an integral part of Boiko people's ethnographic area. The village is a traditional social-ecological system defined by the traditional land use of pre-industrial cultural landscapes, and a spatial structure with land use zones satisfying different needs. Using documents on regional environmental history, analysis of socio-economic statistics, and interviews with local land users, we evaluated the extent to which the traditional village system supports socio-cultural dimensions of sustainable forest management. Our review of environmental history indicates that after different phases of cultural landscape development during several 100 years, the traditional village system is still a basic unit of the Skole district's forest landscapes. However, data and interviews show that the traditional village system is endangered. Making use of the total economic value of forest landscape resources, including wood and non-wood products and services based on cultural values and biodiversity, is an urgent task. Support of traditional village socio-cultural functions and land use systems including fields, wooded grasslands and forests should be milestones in a regional program of sustainable forest management. Traditional village system zoning and land use systems would be good indicators of sustainable forest landscapes. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

title={Understanding trends in biological invasions by introduced mammals in southern South America: a review of research and management},
journal={MAMMAL REVIEW},

volume={46},

pages={229-240},
month={JUL},
abstract={Invasive introduced mammals (IIMs) have ecological and social dimensions that require holistic research to integrate academic disciplines with basic and applied sciences. We assessed current knowledge of IIMs to determine trends in their study and management in southern South America. A keyword search was used to select indexed papers in the Web of Science. These were reviewed to assess each study's objective, methodology, country, publication year, and taxa. Unpublished grey' literature was added to evaluate further each species' native range, year of introduction, the reason for its introduction, its distribution, dispersal pathways, impacts, and management. Most of the 190 peer-reviewed publications were focused on autecology and impacts of IIMs; less than 4\% addressed management or social topics. Twenty-three IIMs have been documented in the study area. The southern Magellanic subpolar forest was the most invaded ecoregion (17 spp.), and the most studied orders, from 440 records in 190 papers, were Artiodactyla (35\%) and Rodentia (28\%). Together, livestock and commensals brought during early European colonisation constituted 44\% of this assemblage, but hunting was the major reason behind the introduction of IIMs (30\%). To enhance policies and institutional frameworks pertaining to biological invasions, we highlight the importance of: 1) recognising the presence and spread of IIMs in pristine' or protected areas; 2) improving controls to prevent new introductions and escapes; 3) including social and cultural aspects of biological invasions in research and management plans; 4) reinforcing hunting regulations; 5) establishing long-term programmes to monitor distribution and dispersion; 6) creating mechanisms for scientists and managers to co-produce research and policy programmes oriented towards applied issues; 7) developing pilot management projects in critical areas; 8) achieving societal involvement in management programmes to ensure public acceptance; and 9) developing prioritisation tools, as resources needed to manage IIMs are often limited.},

abstract={Complexity and uncertainty are inherent in social-ecological systems. Although they can create challenges for scientists and decision makers, they cannot be a reason for delaying decision making. Two strategies have matured in recent decades to address these challenges. Systems thinking, as embodied by conceptual modeling, is a holistic approach in which a system can be better understood by examining it as a whole. Expert elicitation represents a second strategy that enables a greater diversity of inputs to understand complex systems. We explored the use of conceptual models and expert judgments to inform expansion of monitoring around oil sands development in northern Alberta, Canada, particularly related to migratory forest birds. This study area is a complex social-ecological system for which there is an abundance of specific information, but a relatively weak understanding about system behavior. Multiple conceptual models were developed to represent complexity and provide a more fulsome view of influences across the landscape. A hierarchical approach proved useful, and a mechanistic structure of the models clarified the cumulative and interactive nature of factors within and outside the study area. To address gaps in understanding, expert judgments were integrated using a series of structured exercises to derive ``weightings{''} of importance of different components in the conceptual models, specifically pairwise comparisons, Likert scaling, and a maximum difference conjoint approach. These exercises were helpful for discriminating the importance of different influences and illuminating the competing beliefs of experts. Various supporting tools helped us engage a group of experts from across North America, which included a virtual meeting, online polling, desktop sharing, web survey, and financial incentive. This combination of techniques was innovative and proved useful for addressing complexity and uncertainty in a specific natural resource management setting, which can be informative for others facing similar challenges.},

year={2024},
volume={16},
number={3},
pages={NA},
month={FEB},
abstract={During the 1992 Rio Conference, the sustainable development agenda envisioned a transformative change for the management of natural resources, where the well-being of human society would be enhanced through the sustainable use of natural capital. Several decades on, relentless economic growth persists at the expense of natural capital, as demonstrated by biodiversity decline, climate change and other environmental challenges. Why is this happening and what can be done about it? We present three agent-based models that explore the social, economic and governance factors driving (un)sustainability in complex social-ecological systems. Our modelling results reinforce the idea that the current economic system fails to safeguard the natural capital upon which it relies, leading to the prevailing decoupling between the economic and natural systems. In attempting to find solutions for such disjunction, our research shows that social-ecological systems are complex, dynamic and non-linear. Interestingly, results also reveal that there are common factors to most social-ecological systems that have the potential to improve or diminish sustainability: the role of financial entities and monetary debt; economic speculation; technological development and efficiency; long-term views, tipping point management and government interventions; and top-down and bottom-up conservation forces. These factors can play a dual role, as they can either undermine or enhance sustainability depending on their specific context and particular conditions. Therefore, the current economic system may not be inherently unsustainable, but rather specific economic mechanisms, decision-making processes and the complex links between economic and natural systems could be at the root of the problem. We argue that short- and medium-term sustainability can be achieved by implementing mechanisms that shift capitalist forces to support environmental conservation. Long-term sustainability, in contrast, requires a more profound paradigm shift: the full integration and accounting of externalities and natural capital into the economy.},

The Network for Conserving Central India (NCCI) provides a platform for such collaborations in a globally important tiger conservation region within a complex social-ecological system. Using the NCCI as an example, our study identifies indicators to track progress in collaborative landscape-level networks across four dimensions: the composition of the network; collaborative scientific output; dissemination of research outputs through social, electronic and print media; and participation in policy and decision-making bodies. The NCCI is primarily comprised of members of the scientific community, Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) and various levels of government. Since 2013, the NCCI members conducted research that predominantly addressed human-wildlife conflicts and human livelihood needs around protected areas (PAs), with less attention to forest ecology and climate. NGOs within the NCCI work closely with local communities and provide avenues for local engagement. Co-production of policies is an essential but challenging goal due to established hierarchies and top-down institutional structures. Our analyses highlight the NCCI's role as a knowledge platform and bridge among researchers, NGOs, and government, with significant opportunities for boundary work in the Science, Policy and Practice Interface (SPPI). A challenging and unfulfilled goal is the engagement of local communities to co-produce approaches that balance conservation, local livelihoods, and development. We suggest that other landscape-level networks in social-ecological systems can modify these dimensions as pertinent to their respective circumstances to track progress towards co-produced management to address livelihood and conservation needs.},

abstract={This editorial introduces the special feature on the social-ecological system of a fire-prone forest landscape in Oregon, USA. Research into social-ecological systems of fire-frequent landscapes is in its infancy and this special feature highlights one of the first attempts to understand a fire-dependent forest landscape from this perspective. An agent-based landscape modeling framework, Envision, was the primary tool for the research. The papers in this special feature examine three major questions: (1) What is the landscape structure of forest conditions, fire regimes, ownerships, and attitudes toward fire and forest management?; (2) How are social networks of the study region structured and how might they influence attitudes and actions of landowners?; (3) How do land management policies, institutions, and decisions interact to influence future fire occurrence, biodiversity, and ecosystem services? The findings of the empirical research and simulation modeling reveal how the high ecological and social (e.g., landownership and management goals) diversity of the region contributes to very different fire potentials, attitudes, and management approaches across space. The social network analysis reveals that the social network is divided into fire protection and fire restoration subnetworks that only a few organizations were able to bridge. The simulation modeling shows how difficult it can be to affect fire behavior across large areas, and what the trade-offs of different management actions might be in terms of ecosystem services and fire risk. The special feature also includes papers that examine how social science research is influenced by the use of an agent-based model, and what has been learned about the process of conducting social-ecological research and engaging with stakeholders with the goal of improving understanding of and adaptation to fire-frequent landscapes.},

title={Sustainability in forest management and a new role for resilience thinking},

month={DEC 15},
abstract={Forest management faces a substantial challenge with ever-more-pervasive anthropogenic impacts and growing demands on forests coupled with the increasing certainty of global change. If the capacity of forests to provide valued ecological goods and services in the future is to be maintained, new tools and approaches will be needed. Several approaches have been influential in dealing with sustainability challenges in forest management and forestry to date, two of the most notable being the ecosystem approach and adaptive management. Resilience-based approaches have now emerged as a new paradigm to deal with these challenges. This paper considers how resilience thinking might inform forest management by exploring its conceptual basis in comparison with the ecosystem approach and adaptive management as two earlier influences. We identify three novel conceptual contributions and outline some of the key challenges encountered when applying resilience thinking to the management of forests. Resilience thinking offers new conceptual contributions for dealing with large and uncertain changes, the relationships between social and ecological components of forest systems, and a new perspective on sustainability. However, there are several barriers to it informing forest management in a practical way, including means by which resilience can be measured and valued within a management context, and most importantly, how resilience can be maintained and enhanced within systems focused on resource production or service provision. Resilience thinking's contributions are largely conceptual at this stage and offer more in terms a problem-framing approach than analytical or practical tools. Decision-relevant, science-based, and solution-oriented approaches are required to tackle future forest management challenges. Resilience thinking, if developed to become more solution-orientated could offer a needed complement to current management paradigms. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

month={APR-JUN},
abstract={People and nature interact since millennia in forests worldwide, but current management strategies addressing these ecosystems often exclude local people from the decision-making process. This top-down approach is the cornerstone of conservation initiatives, particularly in highly threatened and fragmented forested ecosystems. In contrast, collaborative management involving the participation of local com-munities has increasingly contributed to conservation efforts globally. Here we ask how collaborative management would contribute to the conservation of a threatened, culturally important, and keystone tree species. We address this question in the Araucaria Forest System1 (AFS) in southern Brazil, where the main conservation strategy has been top-down based on restrictive use. Throughout the entire distribu-tion of AFS, we interviewed 97 smallholders about how they use and manage Araucaria angustifolia trees (araucaria). We integrated their Traditional Ecological Knowledge2 (TEK) with a literature review about the conservation status of Araucaria Forests to analyze potential outcomes of two alternative conservation models: top-down with restrictive use, and bottom-up with collaborative management. We identified the feedback mechanisms in each model, and how they dampen or self-reinforced critical processes for AFS resilience. Our models showed that a top-down strategy maintains forest cover resilient to illegal logging but at the cost of losing TEK (undermining socio-ecological resilience) and forest resilience to other external disturbances, such as climate change. Alternatively, a bottom-up approach based on successful collaborative management schemes may increase the general resilience of AFS, while preserving TEK, thus contributing to maintaining the entire social-ecological system. Our findings indicate how it is paramount to maintain TEK to conserve AFS in the long term through collaborative management. By including local actors in the governance of AFS, its resilience is reinforced, promoting forest expansion, maintenance of TEK, and participatory conservation.},

journal={SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
year={2021},
volume={768},

month={MAY 10},
abstract={The Mesopotamian Marshlands are the largest wetland system in the Middle East. Historically, these marshes served as the floodplains of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, and they are currently connected to these rivers via surface water feeder canals. Historically, the Mesopotamian marshes received consistent flood pulses during the spring season from March to May. In recent decades, however, several large dams have been constructed in the Tigris and Euphrates basins for irrigation purposes and power generation, severely altering the flow regime. which along with other direct anthropogenic activities, has severely degraded the marsh ecosystem. This work quantifies changes in the riverine flow regime and how they have affected the hydro-pattern of the western Mesopotamian marshes (focusing on the western Al-Hammar marsh) and describes the role of hydrological drivers that are important for marsh restoration. The total area of the Al-Hammar marshes has been reduced from an average of 2800 km(2) before 1970 to a minimum of 240 km(2) in recent decades, concomitant with reductions in annual average Euphrates River flow (at Hit) from 967 to 602 m(3)/s and marked flow regime alteration. While climate warming and reduced precipitation were observed in the basin, changes in the fundamental precipitation-flow relationship implicate infrastructural changes (upstream dams) as the primary reason for these changes. This analysis quantified how flow variability under historic and contemporary conditions have affected wetland area and other hydro-pattern characteristics and suggests that at an annual average of least 70 m(3)/s of water deliveries to the western Mesopotamian marsh are required to restore 1000 km(2) of wetland area. Our hope is that this focus on the river-marsh connection will help inform predictive models and scenario analysis for restoration of this unique social-ecological system. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

year={2015},
volume={20},
number={2},
pages={NA},
month={NA},
abstract={Rapid climate change poses complex challenges for conservation, especially in tropical developing countries where biodiversity is high while financial and technical resources are limited. The complexity is heightened by uncertainty in predicted effects, both for ecological systems and human communities that depend heavily on natural resource extraction and use. Effective conservation plans and measures must be inexpensive, fast-acting, and able to increase the resilience of both the ecosystem and the social-ecological system. We present conservation practitioners with a framework that strategically integrates climate change planning into connectivity measures for tropical mountain ecosystems in Costa Rica. We propose a strategy for doubling the amount of habitat currently protected in riparian corridors using measures that are relatively low cost and fast-acting, and will employ and expand human capital. We argue that habitat connectivity must be enhanced along latitudinal gradients, but also within the same elevational bands, via a lattice-work corridor system. This is needed to facilitate range shifts for mobile species and evolutionary adaptation for less mobile species. We think that conservation measures within the elevational bands must include conservation-friendly land uses that improve current and future human livelihoods under dynamic conditions. Key components include community involvement, habitat priority-setting, forest landscape restoration, and environmental services payments. Our approach is fundamentally adaptive in that the conservation measures employed are informed by on-the-ground successes and failures and modified accordingly, but are relatively low risk and fast-acting. Our proposal, if implemented, would satisfy tenets of climate-smart conservation, improve the resilience of human and ecological communities, and be a model for other locations facing similar challenges.},

pages={84-97},

abstract={Purpose - Recent climate scenarios indicate that Sweden's southern region, Gotaland, will experience significant climate change over the coming century. Swedish forestry policy guidelines emphasize the need for risk spreading to reduce the potential adverse impacts of these changes. Risk spreading is defined here as reducing the vulnerability of a social-ecological system by increasing the heterogeneity of its ecological components. Risk spreading may be achieved through the diversification of tree species currently relied upon by the forestry sector. The purpose of this paper is to consider the capacity of the socio-ecological forest system to adapt to climate change through the use of risk spreading. Design/methodology/approach - A variety of disciplines contribute to the understanding of the rate at which risk spreading is likely to take place in a system. A synthesis is conducted to unite these insights. Findings - Five key constraints on the rate at which risk spreading can take place are identified. These include constraints imposed by the silvicultural system itself, voluntary policy measures, forest-owner perceptions of climate change, motivation among forest owners to respond to risk, and forestry consultants. Potential future directions are discussed and include the need for specifying the goal of risk spreading policy, and the need to evaluate the motivations of those forest owners already altering adopting risk spreading approaches. Originality/value - Conceptual equivalents of the ``risk spreading{'' approach are international, due to the need for many societies to adapt social-ecological systems to climate change. The issues raised from this case study/synthesis provide value insights regarding the breadth of systemic constraints which can thwart attempts at rapid adjustment to climate change, and where solutions to these constraints may be found.},

abstract={Analysis of social-ecological systems is becoming increasingly used since the framework provides a valuable set of variables for understanding relationships between people and ecosystems. This interaction focuses on the use and management of natural resources that, in many cases, are common-pool resources. In Mexico, common-pool resources have long been explored since at least 60\% of the forested lands in the country are held under the legal figure of `ejidos' and indigenous communities, which aimed at driving the collective use of lands and resources. However, few studies incorporate ecological processes for an integrated understanding of social-ecological systems. In this study, we seek to understand how ecological variability influences the creation and functioning of different rules and, consequently, institutions for forests management. Our case study was conducted in an ejido with high ecological variability located in Jalisco on the Pacific coast of Mexico. The research approach was interdisciplinary and combined qualitative and quantitative methods. We conducted participant observation and 23 semi-structured interviews; botanical collections were also carried out. We found that there is strong influence between ecological variables and the emergence of rules and collective action. The most important variables influencing these processes were the economic value of resource units, ecosystem services perceived by local people and location and size of the resource system (including area and number of species). Historical processes also play a part that generates knowledge of resource systems and the current social, economic and political settings at a larger scale. The establishment of relationships with variables that produce certain outcomes for the framework of the social-ecological system is an important challenge to be met in order to move forward in both theory and practice.},

abstract={Recreation ecology has its foundations in the premise that recreationists have a negative impact on ecosystems, and are thus treated as an ecological stressor. However, ecology is the study of interactions between organisms and the environment, not just an organism's impacts on the environment. While we do not dispute the evidence that recreationists can negatively impact ecosystems, recreation can also have positive effects for conservation. Contextualizing interactions between recreation and ecology within broader multi-scale social-ecological systems can advance our scientific knowledge of these interactions to provide a basis for more effective management of protected areas that host recreation. In this paper, we propose the concept that recreation-ecosystem interactions are part of a system with a range of positive, negative, and neutral interactions with feedbacks of variable intensity occurring between multiple levels. We simplify this concept into a two-dimensional quadrant system to describe the spectrum of interactions within a range of social-ecological systems, which could be developed for countless natural and social systems. For example, the social portion of this system includes values such as cultural, health and well-being, tribal, and many others; examples of the ecological portion include vegetation, biodiversity, soils, and more. As an illustrative example, we develop the system for recreation-wildlife interactions. We also emphasize the importance of integrating recreation and wildlife research and management through approaches based on this framework. Future research in this area might be improved by considering this novel framework to balance the needs of humans and protect natural ecosystems in protected area management decisions.Management implications: The framework aims to help outdoor recreation managers and researchers better-Address existing gaps in research and management,-Collaborate with those working in complementary fields ,-Develop more integrative recreation planning and management tools, and-Resolve persistent problems in outdoor recreation management.},

abstract={Urban forest modeling is becoming increasingly complex, global, and transdisciplinary. Increased modeling of urban forest structure and function presents an urgent need for comparative studies to assess the similarities and differences between modeling techniques and applications. This paper provides a systematic review of 242 journal papers over the past two-decades, and identifies 476 case studies. We assess model case studies among different locations, units and scales, compare the ability and functional capacity of the models and different tools, compare papers published in different disciplines, and identify new emerging topics in the field of urban forest modeling. Conclusions from this analysis include: (1) the spatial distribution of case studies is primarily clustered around the US, Europe, and China, with the most popular units to model being streets and parks; (2) the most commonly used model types are the i-Tree toolset, ENVI-met computational fluid dynamic models, and the Hedonic price model; (3) uncertainty assessment of urban forest models is limited; (4) spatially explicit models are critically important for estimating of ecosystem services as well as for environment management; (5) most case studies focus on biophysical benefits with few studies estimating economic and social benefits; and (6) linkages between urban forests and their social-psychological and health effects are less common due to subjectivity and uncertainty in expressing and quantifying human cultures, attitudes and behaviors. Based on a comparison of different models and a syntheses of case studies, we make suggestions for future research connecting urban forestry and urban ecosystems, model development, and ecosystem services. Such knowledge is critical for policy- and decision-makers, and can help improve urban forest planning, design and management.},

abstract={An increasing number of studies have found that the implementation of feeding sites for wildlife-related tourism can affect animal health, behaviour and reproduction. Feeding sites can favour high densities, home range overlap, greater sedentary behaviour and increased interspecific contacts, all of which might promote parasite transmission. In the Yunnan snub-nosed monkey (Rhinopithecus bieti), human interventions via provisioning monkeys at specific feeding sites have led to the sub-structuring of a group into genetically differentiated sub-groups. The fed subgroup is located near human hamlets and interacts with domesticated animals. Using high-throughput sequencing, we investigated Entamoeba species diversity in a local host assemblage strongly influenced by provisioning for wildlife-related tourism. We identified 13 Entamoeba species or lineages in faeces of Yunnan snub-nosed monkeys, humans and domesticated animals (including pigs, cattle, and domestic chicken). In Yunnan snub-nosed monkeys, Entamoeba prevalence and OTU richness were higher in the fed than in the wild subgroup. Entamoeba polecki was found in monkeys, pigs and humans, suggesting that this parasite might circulates between the wild and domestic components of this local social-ecological system. The highest proportion of faeces positive for Entamoeba in monkeys geographically coincided with the presence of livestock and humans. These elements suggest that feeding sites might indirectly play a role on parasite transmission in the Yunnan snub-nosed monkey. The implementation of such sites should carefully consider the risk of creating hotspots of disease transmission, which should be prevented by maintaining a buffer zone between monkeys and livestock/humans. Regular screenings for pathogens in fed subgroup are necessary to monitor transmission risk in order to balance the economic development of human communities dependent on wildlife-related tourism, and the conservation of the endangered Yunnan snub-nosed monkey.},

abstract={Large, old trees are keystone ecological structures, their decline having disproportional ecological consequences. There is virtually no information available regarding the status and occurrence of old trees in traditional cultural landscapes from Eastern Europe. In this study, we explore the environmental determinants of the old oaks found in wood-pastures from a changing traditional rural landscape from Central Romania. Both the old oaks and the wood-pastures harboring them have exceptional cultural, historical, and ecological values, yet are vulnerable to land-use change. We surveyed 41 wood-pastures from Southern Transylvania and counted the old oaks in them. We then related the number of old oaks from these wood-pastures to a set of local and landscape level variables related to wood-pastures. We found 490 old oaks in 25 wood-pastures. The number of old oaks was positively related to the size of the wood-pasture and the amount of pasture and forest around it (500 m buffer), and negatively related to the proximity of the village. Furthermore, we found a significant interaction between the effects of sheepfolds in the wood-pasture and the size of the wood-pasture on the number of old trees, indicating a negative influence of sheepfolds on the number of old trees in smaller sized wood-pastures. There is an increasing risk for losing old trees in the traditional cultural landscapes due to the lack of formal recognition of these trees. Therefore, while presenting the positive example of local initiatives and citizen science, we argue for an urgent development and implementation of conservation policies along with education strategies targeting the old trees and rural communities from the changing traditional cultural landscapes of Eastern Europe.},

abstract={Tourism, as all human activities, is dependent on the natural environment and its respective ecosystem services (ES). Different user groups manage and consume these touristic ES differently, resulting in discrepancies and potential conflicts. Despite the urgency to find inclusive local approaches for sustainable development, tourism studies still analyze socio-economic and ecological impacts separately and lack integrated social-ecological approaches to improve foresight in tourism planning. Based on a growing concern regarding the future of Costalegre on the Jalisco coast of Western Mexico, we analyze through interviews, surveys, and participant observation the dependence of tourism on specific ecosystem services and conduct a scenario analysis which shows present and future implications for the social-ecological system. Furthermore, this analysis shows in detail how different scenarios change ES provision and people's livelihoods. Key findings include identifying freshwater provision and cultural ES as the most important touristic ES. At a regional scale, peasants in ejidos are the main ES stewards, whereas high-class tourism facilities constitute important local stewards. Benefits, mainly access to freshwater and the beach, are unequally distributed, provoking conflicts among different ES user groups that may escalate in the near future. Improved communication between all user groups and strengthening of key political actors seem to be the most immediate recommendations to ensure the long term sustainability of this particular region. This work may contribute to improved planning and decision-making as our ES based scenarios are a first step to integrate social-ecological knowledge into improved decision-making. At a local scale, the study reveals the most likely future development options and their social and ecological consequences. It could also serve as a baseline for informed policy making.

journal={ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
year={2009},
volume={14},
number={2},
pages={NA},
month={NA},
abstract={The landscape of Mengsong, southwest China, was biologically diverse until recently due to historical biogeographical processes overlain by the swidden-cultivation practices of the Hani who migrated there several centuries ago. Our research sought to understand how the Hani adjusted their livelihoods to new policies, markets, and technologies, and the consequences for biodiversity conservation. We combined landscape, plot, and household surveys, interviews, and reviews of secondary documents, to reconstruct the major changes and responses to challenges in the social-ecological system over previous decades. Significant changes from closed to open canopy of secondary-forest vegetation took place between 1965-1993 and from open-canopy to closed-canopy forest between 1993-2006, mostly explainable by changes in state land-use policies and the market economy. Most remaining swidden-fallow succession had been converted into tea or rubber plantations. Swidden-fallow fields used to contain significant levels of biological diversity. Until 2000, biodiversity served several important ecological and social functions in the Hani livelihood system. Indigenous institutions were often functional, for example, linked to fire control, soil management, and watershed protection. For centuries, the Hani had detailed knowledge of the landscape, helping them to adjust rapidly to ecological disturbances and changes in production demands. The Hani understood succession processes that enabled them to carry out long-term land-management strategies. Recent government policies and market dynamics have simplified livelihoods and landscapes, seriously reducing biodiversity, but greatly increasing the area of closed-canopy forest (including plantations) and undermining the usefulness of Hani knowledge and land-use institutions. Meeting both conservation and development objectives in this landscape will require new functional links between sustainable livelihoods, culture, and biodiversity, rather than seeking to recreate the past.},

journal={ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},

pages={NA},
month={NA},
abstract={To maximize specific ecosystem services (ES) such as food production, people alter landscape structure, i.e., the types of ecosystems present, their relative proportions, and their spatial arrangement across landscapes. This can have significant, and sometimes unexpected, effects on biodiversity and ES. Communities need information about how land/use activities and changes to landscape structure are likely to affect biodiversity and ES, but current scientific understanding of these effects is incomplete. The Monteregie Connection (MC) project has used the rapidly suburbanizing agricultural Monteregien landscape just east of Montreal, Quebec, Canada, to investigate how current and historic landscape structure influences ES provision. Our results highlight the importance of forest connectivity and functional diversity on ES provision, and show that ES provision can vary significantly even within single land-use types in response to changes in landscape structure. Our historical analysis reveals that levels of ES provision, as well as relationships among individual ES, can change dramatically through time. We are using these results to build quantitative ES-landscape structure models to assess four future landscape scenarios for the region: Periurban Development, Demand for Energy, Whole-System Crisis, and Green Development. These scenarios integrate empirical and historical data on ES provision with local stakeholder input about global and local social and ecological drivers to explore how land-use decisions could affect ES provision and human well-being across the region to the year 2045. By integrating empirical data, quantitative models, and scenarios we have achieved the central goals of the MC project: (1) increasing understanding of the effects of landscape structure on biodiversity and ES provision, (2) effectively linking this knowledge to decision making to better manage for biodiversity and ES, and (3) creating a vision for a more sustainable social-ecological system in the region.},

abstract={Land use change arises from a variety of socio-economic and/or biophysical drivers, with direct and/or indirect feedbacks on the long-term functionality of the land as the fundamental life-support system for human wellbeing. Understanding the spatiotemporal dynamics of production systems is critical for decision-making to maintain both functioning ecosystems and land-dependent livelihoods. We applied the adaptive cycle metaphor to examine historic spatiotemporal changes in one of the largest communal regions (ejido) in the Northern most extension of the tropical forest biome in Mexico. This large-scale case study explores the effects of a series of exogenous and endogenous drivers that transformed a former dense tropical forest into an intensive industrial sugarcane plantation with parallel developments and adjustments of rural livelihoods. We demonstrate how integral knowledge on the historical development of a 70-year old social-ecological system (SES) helps build fundamental understanding of the vulnerability, resilience, and adaptability of land and people (livelihoods) to current diverse external and endogenous drivers. With the adaptive cycle metaphor, we identified stable system states and the current phase of our focal SES, which, before the 1940s, was covered by dense dry tropical forest. The current SES had passed all phases in the adaptive cycle more than once and is presently in the early conservation phase represented by a high input commercial sugarcane production system with reduced resilience to external drivers of change. We show which drivers and historical events best explained the regional socioecological system dynamics including its vulnerability, resilience, and adaptability considering certain system states. Understanding system dynamics and phase changes considering the adaptive cycle metaphor helps identify both social and ecological resilience characteristics, and unexplored windows of opportunity for guided transformation of system states out of social-ecological traps.},

abstract={The path for bringing millions of people out of poverty in Africa is likely to coincide with important changes in land use and land cover (LULC). Envisioning the different possible pathways for agricultural, economic and social development, and their implications for changes in LULC, ecosystem services and society well-being, will improve policy-making. This paper presents a case that uses a multi-scale participatory scenario planning method to facilitate the understanding of the complex interactions between LULC change and the wellbeing of the rural population and their possible future evolution in Mozambique up to 2035. Key drivers of change were identified: the empowerment of civil society, the effective application of legislation and changes in rural technologies (e.g., information and communications technologies and renewable energy sources). Three scenarios were constructed: one characterized by the government promoting large investments; a second scenario characterized by the increase in local community power and public policies to promote small and medium enterprises; and a third, intermediate scenario. All three scenarios highlight qualitative large LULC changes, either driven by large companies or by small and medium scale farmers. The scenarios have different impact in wellbeing and equity, the first one implying a higher rural to urban area migration. The results also show that the effective application of the law can produce different results, from assuring large international investments to assuring the improvement of social services like education, health care and extension services. Successful application of these policies, both for biodiversity and ecosystem services protection, and for the social services needed to improve the well-being of the Mozambican rural population, will have to overcome significant barriers.},

abstract={The short- and long-term impacts from natural hazards, which are thought to be the consequences of climate change, interrupt the functions of the social-ecological system of the Sundarbans Mangrove Forest (SMF) in Bangladesh, which in turn affect the livelihood of people at risk. In the absence of sustainable livelihood options, over time these people have become more dependent on the resources of the Sundarbans. This study investigates how their livelihood strategies affect the dependency pattern on the common resources of this mangrove forest during economic depressions that resulted from disasters caused by extreme climatic events. The focus of this investigation is on a sub-district known as Koyra, located in southwestern coastal Bangladesh, which has the longest border with the Sundarbans. Relevant parameters such as climatic trends and extreme events, financial-physical-structural damage patterns, socioeconomic peculiarities, changes in consumption expenditure, asset portfolio, and occupation patterns are considered. Data are collected from 420 households through face-to-face questionnaires and seven focus group discussions (FGDs). The empirical results suggest that the higher intensity and frequency of natural hazards have led to substantially higher damages of asset and capital goods. Over the last two decades, around 8 \% of the sampled households have become landless; more than 25 \% have switched from crops to other nonagricultural occupations; and more than 26 \% have started depending on forest resources for their consumption smoothing. In addition, each household has incurred annual disaster damages of on average US\$ 177. Combined with the absence of well-defined property rights, the people at risk have become more dependent on resources from the SMF for their livelihoods as well as consumption smoothing, which eventually is likely to jeopardize the stock of renewable resources of this forest. We recommend redefining property rights to ensure a win-win platform for all the stakeholders.},

abstract={Understanding how urban forests developed their current patterns of tree canopy cover, species composition, and diversity requires an appreciation of historical legacy effects. However, analyses of current urban forest characteristics are often limited to contemporary socioeconomic factors, overlooking the role of history. The institutions, human communities, and biophysical conditions of cities change over time, creating layers of legacies on the landscape, shifting urban forests through complex interactive processes and feedbacks. Urban green spaces and planted trees can persist long after their establishment, meaning that today's mature canopy reflects conditions and decisions from many years prior. In this synthesis article, we discuss some of the major historical human and biophysical drivers and associated legacy effects expressed in present urban forest patterns, highlighting examples in the United States and Canada. The bioregional context - native biome, climate, topography, initial vegetation, and pre-urbanization land use - represents the initial conditions in which a city established and grew, and this context influences how legacy effects unfold. Human drivers of legacy effects can reflect specific historical periods: colonial histories related to the symbolism of certain species, and the urban parks and civic beautification movements. Other human drivers include phenomena that cut across time periods such as neighborhood urban form and socioeconomic change. Biophysical legacy effects include the consequences of past disturbances such as extreme weather events and pest and disease outbreaks. Urban tree professionals play a major role in many legacy effects by mediating the interactions and feedbacks between biophysical and human drivers. We emphasize the importance of historical perspectives to understand past drivers that have produced current urban forest patterns, and call for interdisciplinary and mixed methods research to unpack the mechanisms of long-term urban forest change at intra- and inter-city scales.},

title={An intergenerational transmission of sustainability? Ancestral habitus and food production in a traditional agro-ecosystem of the Upper Guinea Forest, West Africa},

abstract={The need for sustainable alternatives to industrial farming has led to a revival of interest in traditional agro-ecosystems. Whilst it is well recognised that traditional agro-ecosystems are both social and physical-technical - few case studies have examined interactions between both these dimensions in a single system. For a system to be considered sustainable it needs to be shown to have retained key characteristics over several generations. Case studies therefore demand a location where intergenerational transmission of agro-ecological knowledge and practice is ongoing. This paper examines the intergenerational transmission of social and physical-technical dimensions of a traditional agroecosystem of the Loma people in NW Liberia. We engage an innovative interdisciplinary combination of methodologies in analyzing interactions between: (i) energy efficiencies (yield to labour) in 3 different Loma food production systems, using longitudinal quantitative surveys, and, (ii) the social institutions that mediate food production practice, using qualitative methods. Our energy efficiency calculations show that AIDE cultivation is more than twice as efficient at producing calories as either shifting cultivation or forest and river extractivism, yet GPS mapping demonstrates that AIDE cultivation is highly spatially restricted despite clear opportunities for expansion and optimisation. This raises an important question: why have the Loma not expanded AIDE cultivation? We propose that despite being fully aware of the opportunities AfDEs present, a Loma `ancestral habitus' and substantive economic rationality restrict areal expansion and optimisation of AIDE cultivation, curtailing growth and structuring a social-ecological system in dynamic equilibrium. Our findings underline that sustainability is not simply a physio-technical issue; social and belief issues appear to be far more important in framing behaviour in traditional agro-ecosystems.

volume={36},

month={FEB},
abstract={Context Maintaining functional green infrastructures (GIs) require evidence-based knowledge about historic and current states and trends of representative land cover types. Objectives We address: (1) the long-term loss and transformation of potential natural forest vegetation; (2) the effects of site productivity on permanent forest loss and emergence of traditional cultural landscapes; (3) the current management intensity; and (4) the social-ecological contexts conducive to GI maintenance . Methods We selected 16 case study regions, each with a local hotspot landscape, ranging from intact forest landscapes, via contiguous and fragmented forest covers, to severe forest loss. Quantitative open access data were used to estimate (i) the historic change and (ii) transformation of land covers, and (iii) compare the forest canopy loss from 2000 to 2018. Qualitative narratives about each hotspot landscape were analysed for similarities (iv). Results While the potential natural forest vegetation cover in the 16 case study regions had a mean of 86\%, historically it has been reduced to 34\%. Higher site productivity coincided with transformation to non-forest land covers. The mean annual forest canopy loss for 2000-2018 ranged from 0.01 to 1.08\%. The 16 case studies represented five distinct social-ecological contexts (1) radical transformation of landscapes, (2) abuse of protected area concepts, (3) ancient cultural landscapes (4) multi-functional forests, and (5) intensive even-aged forest management, of which 1 and 4 was most common. Conclusions GIs encompass both forest naturalness and traditional cultural landscapes. Our review of Pan-European regions and landscapes revealed similarities in seemingly different contexts, which can support knowledge production and learning about how to sustain GIs.},

abstract={At present, stakeholders wishing to develop land use and management change scenarios at the landscape scale and to assess their corresponding impacts on water quality, biodiversity and economic performance, must examine the output of a suite of separate models. The process is not simple and presents a considerable deterrent to making such comparisons and impedes the development of more sustainable, multifunctional landscapes. To remedy this problem, we developed the Landscapes Toolkit, an integrated modelling framework that assists natural resource managers, policy-makers, planners and local communities explore options for sustainable landscape development. The Landscapes Toolkit links spatially-explicit disciplinary models, to enable integrated assessment of the water quality, biodiversity and economic outcomes of stakeholder-defined land use and management change scenarios. We use the Tully-Murray catchment in the Great Barrier Reef region of Australia as a case study to illustrate the development and application of the Landscapes Toolkit. Results show that the Landscapes Toolkit strikes a satisfactory balance between the inclusion of component models that sufficiently capture the richness of some key aspects of social-ecological system processes and the need for stakeholders to understand and compare the results of the different models. The latter is a prerequisite to making more informed decisions about sustainable landscape development. The flexibility of being able to add additional models and to update existing models is a particular strength of the Landscapes Toolkit design. Hence, the Landscapes Toolkit offers a promising modelling framework for supporting social learning and adaptive management through participatory scenario development and evaluation as well as being a tool to guide planning and policy discussions at the landscape scale.},

abstract={Understanding complex social-ecological systems, and anticipating how they may respond to rapid change, requires an approach that incorporates environmental, social, economic, and policy factors, usually in a context of fragmented data availability. We employed fuzzy cognitive mapping (FCM) to integrate these factors in the assessment of future wildfire risk in the Chiquitania region, Bolivia. In this region, dealing with wildfires is becoming increasingly challenging because of reinforcing feedbacks between multiple drivers. We conducted semistructured interviews and constructed different FCMs in focus groups to understand the regional dynamics of wildfire from diverse perspectives. We used FCM modelling to evaluate possible adaptation scenarios in the context of future drier climatic conditions. Scenarios also considered possible failure to respond in time to the emergent risk. This approach proved of great potential to support decision making for risk management. It helped identify key forcing variables and generate insights into potential risks and trade-offs of different strategies. The ``Hands-off{''} scenario resulted in amplified impacts driven by intensifying trends, affecting particularly the agricultural production under drought conditions. The ``Fire management{''} scenario, which adopted a bottom-up approach to improve controlled burning, showed less trade-offs between wildfire risk reduction and production compared with the ``Fire suppression{''} scenario. Findings highlighted the importance of considering strategies that involve all actors who use fire, and the need to nest these strategies for a more systemic approach to manage wildfire risk. The FCM model could be used as a decision-support tool and serve as a ``boundary object{''} to facilitate collaboration and integration of different perceptions of fire in the region. This approach also has the potential to inform decisions in other dynamic frontier landscapes around the world that are facing increased risk of large wildfires.},

title={Pau-brasil and string instrument bows telecouple nature, art, and heritage},
journal={ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
year={2022},
volume={27},
number={1},
pages={NA},
month={MAR},
abstract={The wood of the pau-brasil tree (Paubrasilia echinata Lam., formerly Caesalpinia echinata Lam.) is used worldwide as raw material for the construction of high-quality bows for string instruments. Alternative tree species are rarely accepted by professional musicians, or by bow and violin makers. Historical overexploitation of this endemic species in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest biome (Mata Atlantica), a global biodiversity hotpot including UNESCO World Natural Heritage Sites, and illegal trade have caused drastic declines in its natural abundance. Pau-brasil is now classified as an endangered species and listed in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. Traditional bow-making craftsmanship, an intangible cultural heritage, depends heavily on the high-quality pau-brasil wood. This complex situation presents unprecedented cross-continental transdisciplinary challenges. In order to target the protection of this coupled natural/cultural heritage, this work frames and examines the pau-brasil/bow-making cultural-ecological system as a complex telecoupled system linked by cultural ecosystem services provided by the pau-brasil, as well as the relationships and cultural exchanges among key actors. Using historical trajectory analysis, we identify past, present, and potential future trigger events, key drivers, and key system variables that explain the dynamics, feedback, and resilience of this complex multidimensional system. Furthermore, with a cross-scale social and power relations analysis, we examine the level of dependencies and influences of contemporary key actors on the ecosystem services provided by the pau-brasil and their interconnections, in order to ultimately identify their level of disadvantage regarding the pau-brasil. Finally, we discuss the potential of this novel cultural-ecological system approach to (i) interlink science, nature, and art, (ii) reconcile the currently competing protection aims of natural and cultural heritage elements, and (iii) provide future trajectories regarding the resilience and sustainable development of this pau-brasil/bowmaking cultural-ecological system. We advocate for this novel path forward toward sustainable transformation of complex cultural-ecological systems urgently needed to navigate our increasingly telecoupled world.},

title={``A shepherd has to invent{''}: Poetic analysis of social-ecological change in the cultural landscape of the central Spanish Pyrenees},
journal={ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
year={2015},
volume={20},
number={4},
pages={NA},
month={NA},
abstract={Since the mid-20th century, the Pyrenean pastoral social-ecological system (SES) has undergone socioeconomic and demographic transformations leading to changes in grazing practices and a decline in the livestock industry. Land abandonment has contributed to an ecological transition from herbaceous vegetation cover to shrublands and forests, leading to a loss of ecosystem services, including biodiversity and forage. I interviewed 27 stockmen (ganaderos) in two valleys of the central Pyrenees to document their traditional ecological knowledge and observations of environmental, social, economic, and cultural changes in the valleys. I used poetic analysis, a qualitative data analysis approach, to illustrate and analyze one ganadero's experience of social-ecological change. First, I created seven poems based on an interview transcript with this ganadero. Second, I analyzed the poetry I created, to see what new insights and understanding about system dynamics and the lived experience of SES change emerged from analysis of the transcript re-presented as poetry. Third, I compared key themes that emerged from this analysis with findings across the other 26 interviews. Fourth, I read the poems and presented the associated analysis to multiple audiences, to gauge their impact and effectiveness in communicating research findings. Finally, I synthesized across the themes raised in the seven poems. Poetic analysis revealed emotional and cultural dimensions of change, especially the importance of occupational and place identity, in the experience of the ganadero. The transcript re-presented as poetry portrayed the ganadero as an agent in creating and maintaining a cultural landscape and as both an adaptor and resister to SES change. Poetic analysis also uncovered telling contradictions, adaptive capacities, and barriers to adaptation in this SES that went unappreciated with conventional qualitative analysis approaches. This exploratory study illustrates the potential of poetry as a method of data analysis and communication in SES research.},

title={Meeting places and social capital supporting rural landscape stewardship: A Pan-European horizon scanning},
journal={ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
year={2021},
volume={26},
number={1},
pages={NA},
month={MAR},
abstract={Achieving sustainable development as an inclusive societal process in rural landscapes, and sustainability in terms of functional green infrastructures for biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services, are wicked challenges. Competing claims from various sectors call for evidence-based adaptive collaborative governance. Leveraging such approaches requires maintenance of several forms of social interactions and capitals. Focusing on Pan-European regions with different environmental histories and cultures, we estimate the state and trends of two groups of factors underpinning rural landscape stewardship, namely, (1) traditional rural landscape and novel face-to-face as well as virtual fora for social interaction, and (2) bonding, bridging, and linking forms of social capital. We applied horizon scanning to 16 local landscapes located in 18 countries, representing Pan-European social-ecological and cultural gradients. The resulting narratives, and rapid appraisal knowledge, were used to estimate portfolios of different fora for social interactions and forms of social capital supporting landscape stewardship. The portfolios of fora for social interactions were linked to societal cultures across the European continent: ``self-expression and secular-rational values{''} in the northwest, ``Catholic{''} in the south, and ``survival and traditional authority values{''} in the East. This was explained by the role of traditional secular and religious local meeting places. Virtual internet-based fora were most widespread. Bonding social capitals were the strongest across the case study landscapes, and linking social capitals were the weakest. This applied to all three groups of fora. Pan-European social-ecological contexts can be divided into distinct clusters with respect to the portfolios of different fora supporting landscape stewardship, which draw mostly on bonding and bridging forms of social capital. This emphasizes the need for regionally and culturally adapted approaches to landscape stewardship, which are underpinned by evidence-based knowledge about how to sustain green infrastructures based on both forest naturalness and cultural landscape values. Sharing knowledge from comparative studies can strengthen linking social capital.},

title={Scale mismatches in social-ecological systems: Causes, consequences, and solutions},
journal={ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
year={2006},
volume={11},
number={1},
pages={NA},
month={JUN},
abstract={Scale is a concept that transcends disciplinary boundaries. In ecology and geography, scale is usually defined in terms of spatial and temporal dimensions. Sociological scale also incorporates space and time, but adds ideas about representation and organization. Although spatial and temporal location determine the context for social and ecological dynamics, social-ecological interactions can create dynamic feedback loops in which humans both influence and are influenced by ecosystem processes. We hypothesize that many of the problems encountered by societies in managing natural resources arise because of a mismatch between the scale of management and the scale(s) of the ecological processes being managed. We use examples from southern Africa and the southern United States to address four main questions: ( 1) What is a ``scale mismatch?{''} ( 2) How are scale mismatches generated? ( 3) What are the consequences of scale mismatches? ( 4) How can scale mismatches be resolved? Scale mismatches occur when the scale of environmental variation and the scale of social organization in which the responsibility for management resides are aligned in such a way that one or more functions of the social-ecological system are disrupted, inefficiencies occur, and/or important components of the system are lost. They are generated by a wide range of social, ecological, and linked social-ecological processes. Mismatches between the scales of ecological processes and the institutions that are responsible for managing them can contribute to a decrease in social-ecological resilience, including the mismanagement of natural resources and a decrease in human well-being. Solutions to scale mismatches usually require institutional changes at more than one hierarchical level. Long-term solutions to scale mismatch problems will depend on social learning and the development of flexible institutions that can adjust and reorganize in response to changes in ecosystems. Further research is needed to improve our ability to diagnose, understand, and resolve scale mismatches in linked social-ecological systems.},

title={The social-ecological drivers across land-use intersects driving marula tree population dynamics in north-eastern South Africa},
journal={FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT},
year={2021},
volume={492},

pages={NA},
month={JUL 15},
abstract={A range of social and economic factors impact tree species, such as Sclerocarya birrea subsp. caffra (marula), which provide livelihood sustenance for local communities in the savanna woodlands of southern Africa. As an ecologically important savanna species, valued both culturally and economically, it is imperative to understand if resource use is sustainable. Population stability can be understood by comparing tree density and size-class distribution (SCD) profiles across land-use types (homestead yards, fields and rangelands) in non-conservation savanna social-ecological systems. Marula tree population data were gathered in rangeland transects and randomly selected fields and yards from four human settlements in the Bushbuckridge municipality of northeastern South Africa. Total density was lowest in fields (mean ? SE = 7.4 ? 0.7 trees/ha) and highest in homestead yards (mean ? SE = 25.7 ? 4.1 trees/ha). Social data revealed that elevated seedling and sapling population densities in yards is linked to discarded kernels from marula beer making. Total densities increased in yards over a 15-year period but declined in rangelands, with female densities remaining almost constant across land-use types over this period. This is an important finding as it is a strong indication of socially-mediated population structure changes, confirming that combined cultural and economic value can lead to examples of species conservation. In this case, the prioritization of female trees as the distinguished fruit producers. SCD revealed weak recruitment in fields and rangelands. Diminished regeneration, combined with overharvesting for fuelwood in rangelands and felling trees in yards, is likely to negatively impact population stability in the longterm. Understanding resource conservation and degradation in the context of important non-timber forest products (NTFPs) is a key knowledge challenge, with this study serving as an updated inventory benchmark for marula populations in the area. Important lessons learned here can be applied to other social-ecological contexts where a key natural resource is responsible for sustaining livelihoods.},

title={Forestry in the Face of Global Change: Results of a Global Survey of Professionals},

pages={473-489},
month={DEC},
abstract={Purpose of ReviewForests support most global terrestrial biodiversity and contribute to the livelihood of billions of people, but these and other benefits are in jeopardy due to global change. This leads to questions, such as how to address the challenges of global change in forest management, given the lack of knowledge and deep uncertainty about future developments. In addition, many of the impediments to implement adaptation strategies are unknown.Recent FindingsHere, we present an overview of results from a global survey of 754 forestry professionals (370 researchers and educators, 227 practicing foresters, 37 policymakers, 64 administrators, and 56 with other or unspecified roles) from 61 countries across 6 continents who were interested in global change issues. These professionals were asked about their opinion regarding three different adaptation strategies: resist, adapt, and transform. Most respondents agreed that the majority of global change factors will negatively influence the ability of forests to provide desired ecosystem services. Similarly, they agreed about major challenges when implementing adaptation strategies and specifically whether our current knowledge base is sufficient. These concerns were not limited to ecological aspects, but respondents also highlighted the need for a better appreciation of social/political and economic barriers, especially regarding transformation strategies. In addition, the response patterns, including differences due to economic status, highlight the importance of developing and evaluating adaptation strategies in a local social-ecological context.SummaryOur study demonstrates a widespread perception on the part of forestry professionals around the world, especially among researchers and practitioners, that many global change factors will affect sustainable forest management negatively, resulting in the need for active silvicultural adaption. The results also suggest potential barriers to different adaptation strategies, particularly a relative lack of information and social acceptance for transform strategies. Further, this study highlights the importance of social and political factors and the need to understand the general public's values regarding adaptation strategies as well as how the influence of public opinion is perceived by forest managers.},

abstract={The dimorphic Ash tree (Fraxinus dimorpha) is a keystone species in the functioning of agro-sylvo pastoral systems and livelihoods found on the northern slopes of the Atlas Mountains of Morocco. It grows in spontaneous woodlands and forests which are fully integrated within agro-ecosystems. Local populations have for centuries shaped ash stands by sequentially trimming and pollarding individual trees for providing fodder, house roof building material and ecosystem services for the overall social-ecological system. Exploitation follows very strictly observed 4-year cycles of exploitation of pollarded trees, which allows the harvesting of each individual tree for foliar forage after 4 years of regrowths, and at the same time shaping and letting some well-grown branches develop for further cycles in order to provide diameter-standardized poles (after 8 years) and beams (after 28-32 years) for house roof construction. The management of tree regeneration is also illustrative of deep-seated Traditional Ecological Knowledge. Overgrazed trees or new seedlings are protected by means of stone walls. Resprouts with the most vigorous and straightest stems are selected and linked to each other, in order to favor, when growing, trunk anastomosis. This highly original practice allows an increase in foliage production of 36\% after a 4-year cycle, compared to non-anastomosed trees, and promotes the resilience and longevity of the trees. The main discrepancies in the vision of what might constitute `good' forest management between local stakeholders and professional foresters concern (1) the scale of the management unit (individual trees and overall forested landscape vs tree stand), (2) the partial (diffuse) exploitation of living trees vs intensive cycles of exploitation of the whole tree stand, and (3) flexibility and pro-active management of heterogeneity vs homogenization. This perspective offers an alternative basis for rethinking forest management strategies in a context of global change, and original insights for conserving anthropized forest ecosystems without excluding people.},

title={Why biodiversity declines as protected areas increase: the effect of the power of governance regimes on sustainable landscapes},
journal={SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE},

volume={10},
number={2},
pages={357-369},

abstract={Achieving sustainable landscapes that integrate food production with biodiversity conservation remains challenging, particularly in the tropics where most forest clearance results from conversion to industrial agriculture. Land-sparing (delineating protected areas and intensifying agricultural production from developed land) has often been identified as more effective than land-sharing (mixing protection and production in an agro-ecological matrix) for biodiversity in the tropics. Nevertheless, biodiversity decline continues despite protected area expansion meeting global targets under international conventions. We developed a low-order stock-and-flow model to consider this apparent paradox, and used it to structure deliberations on the impacts of the power of governance regimes. The model articulates our shared hypothesis about the basic dynamics of the social-ecological system. We present scenarios that depict plausible biodiversity change over time under three different governance regimes and land-use trajectories. The scenarios raise the possibility that, while land-sparing gives better short-term results for biodiversity, land-sharing may outperform it over time. Two key insights derive from our deliberations. First, the forces that drive forest clearance for development do not necessarily oppose those that drive forest protection; this decoupling helps explain why biodiversity loss continues as protected areas increase. Second, the power of the governance regimes that protect existing forest can be weakened by protected area expansion, through lowering public discourse about risks from biodiversity loss, while the power of governance regimes for development concurrently remain strong; this helps explains why some REDD+ schemes are associated with increasing deforestation. These insights suggest novel leverage points for sustainable tropical landscapes, such as prioritising protected area placement by proximity to active agricultural frontiers, rather than by representative biodiversity or cost-effectiveness; or using area-based conservation targets that include both the extent of protected areas and of other remaining forest habitat. We recommend further investigation of these ideas, and of collaborative conceptual modelling approaches, to explore solutions for sustainable tropical landscapes.},

title={Examining the distributional equity of urban tree canopy cover and ecosystem services across United States cities},
journal={PLOS ONE},
year={2020},
volume={15},
number={2},
pages={NA},
month={FEB 11},
abstract={Examining the distributional equity of urban tree canopy cover (UTCC) has increasingly become an important interdisciplinary focus of ecologists and social scientists working within the field of environmental justice. However, while UTCC may serve as a useful proxy for the benefits provided by the urban forest, it is ultimately not a direct measure. In this study, we quantified the monetary value of multiple ecosystem services (ESD) provisioned by urban forests across nine U.S. cities. Next, we examined the distributional equity of UTCC and ESD using a number of commonly investigated socioeconomic variables. Based on trends in the literature, we predicted that UTCC and ESD would be positively associated with the variables median income and percent with an undergraduate degree and negatively associated with the variables percent minority, percent poverty, percent without a high school degree, percent renters, median year home built, and population density. We also predicted that there would be differences in the relationships between each response variable (UTCC and ESD) and the suite of socioeconomic predictor variables examined because of differences in how each response variable is derived. We utilized methods promoted within the environmental justice literature, including a multi-city comparative analysis, the incorporation of high-resolution social and environmental datasets, and the use of spatially explicit models. Patterns between the socioeconomic variables and UTCC and ESD did not consistently support our predictions, highlighting that inequities are generally not universal but rather context dependent. Our results also illustrated that although the variables UTCC and ESD had largely similar relationships with the predictor variables, differences did occur between them. Future distributional equity research should move beyond the use of proxies for environmental amenities when possible while making sure to consider that the use of ecosystem service estimates may result in different patterns with socioeconomic variables of interest. Based on our findings, we conclude that understanding and remedying the challenges associated with inequities requires an understanding of the local social-ecological system if larger sustainability goals are to be achieved.},

title={Perspectives on Climate Change, Mountain Hydrology, and Water Resources in the Oregon Cascades, USA},
journal={MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT},

volume={32},
number={1},
pages={S35-S46},
month={MAR},
abstract={From both social and environmental perspectives, water is the main connection between highland and lowland processes in mountain watersheds: Water flows downhill while human impacts flow uphill. For example, in the Oregon Cascades mountain range, geology, vegetation, and climate influence the hydrologic connections within watersheds. Geology determines which watersheds are surface runoff-dominated and which are groundwater-dominated. In this Mediterranean climate with dry summers, surface runoff watersheds will consistently experience near-zero late summer discharge, so declining snowpacks will have little effect on low flows. This contrasts with groundwater-dominated watersheds, where a shift from snow to rain or a decline in precipitation will reduce recharge, thereby reducing late summer groundwater contributions to streamflow. Earlier snowmelt causes forests to transpire earlier, resulting in decreased springtime streamflow. Reduced snowpacks lead to soil moisture stress, making forests more vulnerable to extensive wildfires and affecting the lifespan and composition of forests. Monitoring and quantifying these complex linkages and feedbacks require appropriate measurement networks. Sampling strategies often use watershed typology to identify where measurements should be focused. Such an approach should include not only established watershed classification parameters such as topology and geology but also interannual climate variability and land cover. As concerns of water scarcity and vulnerability move to the forefront, our watershed classifications should be extended to include ecosystem and social-ecological parameters. An integrated and agent-based modeling scheme called Envision has been developed to simulate alternative future landscapes at the watershed scale. Using fully coupled models of hydrology, ecosystems, and socioeconomics, decision-makers can simulate the effects of policy decisions in conjunction with other climate forcing, land use change, and economic disturbances. To understand the combined impacts of climate change and humans on water in mountain watersheds, researchers must develop integrated monitoring and modeling systems that explicitly include connections across eco-hydrologic and social-ecological systems.},

title={Growth and Collapse of a Resource System: an Adaptive Cycle of Change in Public Lands Governance and Forest Management in Alaska},
journal={ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
year={2009},
volume={14},
number={2},
pages={NA},
month={NA},
abstract={Large-scale government efforts to develop resources for societal benefit have often experienced cycles of growth and decline that leave behind difficult social and ecological legacies. To understand the origins and outcomes of these failures of resource governance, scholars have applied the framework of the adaptive cycle. In this study, we used the adaptive cycle as a diagnostic approach to trace the drivers and dynamics of forest governance surrounding a boom-bust sequence of industrial forest management in one of the largest-scale resource systems in U. S. history: the Tongass National Forest in southeastern Alaska. Our application of the adaptive cycle combined a historical narrative tracing dynamics in political, institutional, and economic subsystems and a longitudinal analysis of an indicator of overall system behavior (timber harvests). We found that federal policies in concert with global market changes drove transformative change in both forest governance (policy making) and forest management (practices), through creation and dissolution of subsidized long-term lease contracts. Evidence of the systemic resilience provided by these leases was found in the analysis of industry responses to market volatility before and after Tongass-specific federal reforms. Although the lease contracts stabilized the Tongass system for a period of time, they fostered a growing degree of rigidity that contributed to a severe industrial collapse and the subsequent emergence of complex social traps. Broader lessons from the Tongass suggest that large-scale changes occurred only when the nested economic and policy cycles were in coherence, and a systemic effort to minimize social and ecological variability ultimately resulted in catastrophic collapse of governance. This collapse resulted in a pervasive and challenging legacy that prevents Tongass reorganization and limits the adaptive capacity of the larger social-ecological system of southeastern Alaska. Although this legacy has inhibited system renewal for two decades, recent trends indicate the emergence of new opportunities for progress toward sustainable governance of the Tongass National Forest.},

journal={ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
year={2022},
volume={27},
number={1},
pages={NA},
month={MAR},
abstract={Indigenous and subsistence-oriented people are particularly sensitive to the impacts of climate change. Strategies to cope and adapt to those changes may rely on traditional ecological knowledge (TEK), which can play an important role for understanding global environmental change at the local level. We aim to provide insights regarding perceptions of climate change, traditional ecological knowledge, and the coping strategies forest-dependent Indigenous people in the Amazon adopt when faced with climate change impacts. The outcomes are based on a mixed set of methods: comprising semi-structured interviews, meteorological data, and photovoice in a case study approach of 49 households of the Indigenous Territory TCO Tacana I in lowland Bolivia. Data were collected in 2013 and 2015; meanwhile, the study area was hit by a severe extreme weather precipitation event and resulting flood in 2014. The results demonstrate that Tacana's perception of weather trends and those of Western science-trained specialists complement each other because they provide different sets of details. The study revealed 38 traditional weather-related short-term indicators that underline the close interaction of Tacana with the environment. However, their current reliability has been questioned, indicating a need for further observation and research for potential long-term environmental change. Photovoice outcomes suggest that most of the negative effects during the extreme weather event were reported on natural capital in subsistence farming households. Indigenous households relied more on strong bonding and networking social capital (intracommunal and external), less on other capitals to cope with the flood event. Acknowledging TEK insights and changing local ecological indicators contributes information to assist sustainable ecosystem management and build corresponding resilient social systems. Local knowledge can support the understanding of climate and environmental change and local and regional risk management planning, interventions, and policy recommendations. This can considerably enhance the effectiveness and robustness of such strategies while counteracting the loss of traditional ecological knowledge.},

abstract={Exploring the cost-effective pathways for restoring ecosystems is a fundamental aspect for scientific communities and policy-makers aiming for a sustainable future. The South China karst region has experienced severe environmental degradation because of unsustainable management practices in this vulnerable social-ecological context. However, it has also become one of the most stunning areas following its remarkable vegetation recovery over recent decades as a result of large-scale ecological restoration programs. There is an extensive body of literature focusing on how ecological restoration programs have altered the degraded environment in this region. By searching and comparing the published peer-reviewed articles, we reviewed the studies related to the effects of ecological restoration programs from the point of view of ecological, socio-economic, and integrated social ecological impacts, as well as influencing factors and restoration approaches. We found independent evidence to support that large-scale ecological restoration programs increased biomass and carbon sequestration since 2000 across this region. The farmers' livelihoods have spontaneously transited from agriculture into forestry or non-farming sectors without financial compensation or incentive schemes, which coincided with a positive correlation between the implementation of ecological restoration programs and poverty alleviation. However, due to a lack of clear ``before and after{''} comparisons, many studies have indirectly determined the impacts of ecological restoration with non-negligible uncertainties. In addition, considering the critical interactions between belowground and aboveground processes in karst regions, special attention should be given to the selection of tree species and restoration measures according to different bedrock types. In the future, to better understand the impacts of ecological restoration on social-ecological systems, research could be advanced by considering data access, context-based analysis, measurement-targeted assessment, and cross-scale integration.

abstract={Individual motivation for the rural use of common-pool resources (CPRs) can be fluid, with the line between subsistence and commercial often unclear and in flux. Implications of fluid motivation are understudied yet important for social-ecological systems (SESs), such as bushmeat hunting throughout Central Africa that is essential to local protein/nutrition, income and culture. Making locally informative predictions of multiple SESs nested within a landscape-scale SES has been historically difficult, but community-driven participatory approaches provide new kinds and quantities of data, opening previously inaccessible doors for research and governance. We apply hierarchical Bayesian structural equation modelling to a novel dataset of 910 hunts from 111 gun and trap hunters across nine villages in Gabon, generated in a participatory process whereby hunters conducted GPS self-follows in conjunction with paraecologist surveys of their motivation, behaviour and offtake. We (i) establish the human behaviour driving gun-hunting and trapping success and predict its effect on offtake across villages and (ii) link fluid motivation of gun hunters to their behaviour, number of animals hunted, biomass yielded and income earned. Gun hunts across villages yielded more animals during the night than the day, and when hunters brought high amounts of ammunition and walked far distances from villages. Gun hunts were less successful when coupled with trapping while per-hunt success of trapping itself was generally low and difficult to predict. Fluid gun hunters hunted fewer animals when motivated strictly by subsistence, despite no reduction in ammunition brought or distance walked, while offtake from strictly commercial versus mixed motivation was the same. Numbers of animals hunted, biomass and income were tightly linked. We discuss the implications of these results for the ecological sustainability of hunting and participatory forecasting in bushmeat research and policy.

abstract={The coastal system can be regarded as co-evolving socio-economic and ecological systems undergoing intense environmental pressures owing to the mechanisms of change exerted by human activities against a background of natural change. Understanding and managing ecological responses to these changes in the coastal areas require interdisciplinary approaches. Here, we develop a new approach of coastal socio-ecological systems (CSES) based on earlier work on the press-pulse dynamics (PPD) socio-ecological systems. To show the relevance of the modified (mPPD) framework, we applied it to two unique features (mangroves and beach systems) of the western African coastal (WAC) systems. Then, we constructed plausible 21st-century coastal systems scenarios at the coast based on a set of descriptive indicators (population growth, economic development, environmental quality, governance, technological advancement and climate change) for a better understanding and sustainable management planning of WAC systems. We found that different indicators characterizing each scenario will exert different pressures on the WAC systems, under the forms of the long-term press and short-term pulse events. The cross-cutting narratives of the different future scenarios in the face of climate change using the mPPD framework offer valuable insight into the development of WAC management strategies, policies and other agendas. It helps to define the plausible implications of following, or not, a particular management path. The inconsistencies between the aspirations of different resource users and lack of coordination of human activities taking place on land and in the coastal zone, partly due to fragmentation of institutions and weak coastal governance are revealed. In this context, the mPPDCSES framework can be used to investigate how ecosystems can experience different (intensities of) press as well as different frequencies of the pulse. Thus, its adaptability to construct future coastal vulnerability scenarios adds to its usefulness as a robust and dependable integrated coastal zone management tool.},

abstract={Managing a complex social-ecological system requires data about the many social and ecological variables characterizing it and about their interactions. While the selection of research topics has its own, mostly unpredictable dynamics and contingencies, there has been a recent surge of interest regarding the involvement of non-academic stakeholders in suggesting research topics and identifying perceived knowledge gaps regarding the management of complex social-ecological systems. Decision-makers will invariably be confronted with limitations regarding resources to be allocated to the study of various systems components, and regarding the processing capacity of scientists and other stakeholders alike. Matang forest is one of the longest-managed mangroves in the world and provides a widely cited example of silvicultural management for charcoal and pole production, while providing a range of other ecosystem services. We applied the nominal group technique (NGT) to identify research priorities for Matang, as it provides a systematic and participatory approach to identify collective priorities while also reducing bias. The method consists of two rounds, during which participants were asked to reflect first individually, and then collectively, about key characteristics of mangrove management and about research priorities in Matang. The results were compared to the recommendations of the scientific literature. NGT provides a rapid, robust and systematic approach to identify research priorities for mangrove management and can hence be a timely method to support decision-makers across South-East Asia in guiding resource allocation toward research needs in times of increasing mangrove degradation. This is the first time that the application of NGT has been documented in a mangrove context. Moreover, NGT is not yet being used frequently in natural resources management, hence in documenting our NGT application, we aim to contribute to the development of a the NGT body of knowledge beyond mere mangrove forest settings. Rapid methods (such as NGT) to identify pressing research priorities are needed to guide resource allocation and investment of time and scientific capacity based on a systematic and pluralistic assessment.},

abstract={Using an environmental impact assessment (EIA) methodology, we provide a novel approach to identify and assess social-ecological outcomes from civic ecology interventions. We quantified the impact significance of six civic (community led) interventions implemented by the Wise Wayz Water Care (WWWC) local community programme (solid waste management, water quality monitoring, invasive alien plant control, crop production, recycling and community engagement), in two communities, situated in urban to peri-urban/rural environments in Durban, South Africa. Interventions resulted in 37 outcomes, of which 36 were positive and one negative. The resulting significance scores from the impact assessment allowed for interventions and their outcomes to be compared. The socio-economic outcomes were the greatest (21), followed by ecological (11) and health outcomes (6). Outcomes included access to education and training; improved quality of life; improved terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems; increase in recreation and cultural uses of natural areas; reduced health risks and increased nutrition. The most significant ecological outcomes resulted from invasive alien plant control, followed by solid waste removal and water quality monitoring. The greatest health outcomes resulted from solid waste removal and vegetable gardens, whereas the greatest social-economic outcomes resulted from the general operation of WWWC, solid waste removal, and invasive alien plant control. We demonstrate that investments in natural areas can deliver not only on enhancements in ecosystems and their services, but also for local community socioeconomic and health benefits. This study provides an intervention quantifying tool for practitioners to select optimal local management interventions, that can be aligned with desired outcomes related to specific community challenges and policy requirements. In so doing, this work shows the critical role that civic interventions play to ensure sustainability, and emphasises how social-ecological systems and ecosystem services perspectives can be used in practice towards achieving sustainable outcomes.},

abstract={Given the substantial contributions of forest biodiversity and ecosystem services to society, forest sciences have a large potential to contribute to the integrity and sustainability of our future. This is especially true when the roles of biodiversity for sustaining ecosystem services are considered. The rapid expansion of sustainable forest management (SFM) has resulted in the adoption of various forest management frameworks intended to safeguard biodiversity. Concurrently, the importance of forest ecosystem services has been increasingly recognized. Although some initiatives aimed at conserving both biodiversity and ecosystem services are emerging, knowledge gaps still exist about their relationships and potential trade-offs in forests. Given recent advancements, increasing opportunities and some lags in forest ecology, further research on biodiversity, ecosystem functions and services will play substantial roles in the development of SFM practices. Here, we identified key issues including (i) relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem function as a foundation of ecological integrity, (ii) resilience thinking to better prepare for and adapt to environmental changes, (iii) social-ecological perspectives that facilitate real-world conservation and management and (iv) theory-driven restoration that bridges science and practice. Thus, we illustrate priorities and future possibilities in applied ecology studies in forests, which will help society and ecosystems to build capacity and resilience to face uncertainty in the changing environment.Synthesis and applications. Under substantial human influences, forests are highly likely to be largely altered, potentially leading to the emergence of novel ecosystems or alternative stable states. Management thus needs more flexible, novel measures to address the significant uncertainty this generates. Resilience-based approaches are important to respond adaptively to future changes and cope with surprises, potentially providing multiple options. Although challenges exist, theory should play an important role in managing, conserving and restoring forest ecosystems. The issues discussed here should receive further attention in the context of the multiple goals of sustainable forest management.},

abstract={About 120 million people worldwide live within 10 km of large mangrove forests, and many of them directly depend on the goods and services provided by these ecosystems. However, it remains unclear how to synchronize ecological definitions and legal conservation strategies regarding mangroves, especially in developing countries, such as Brazil. The influence of human populations' socio-economic context in mangrove conservation policies, as well associated challenges in incorporating this influence, are underestimated or, often, largely ignored. Considering the recent threats emerging from changes in legislation and the lack of spatial and social-ecological integrated data to plan mangrove conservation in Brazil, this paper aims to answer the following questions: (1) What suitable measures could managers and other decision makers adopt for efficient mangrove conservation planning?; (2) What are the site-specific, social-ecological aspects that need to be taken into account when deciding on conservation and management strategies?; and (3) How could science contribute to the development of these measures? In order to achieve an ecosystem-based management approach, mangrove ecosystems should not be divided into sub-systems, but instead treated as an integrated system. Furthermore, interconnections with other coastal ecosystems must be assessed and taken into account. This is crucial for effective systematic conservation planning. Also, most of the particular social-ecological aspects in the different types of mangrove ecosystems along the Brazilian coast, and how those differences might be considered while planning for conservation, remain poorly understood. Based on similar drivers of change, geological features, and likely impacts of climate change, a macro-unit approach is proposed to group mangrove systems along the Brazilian coast and guide national policies. This paper draws parallels with management approaches worldwide to find common points and hence lessons to be applied in other regional realms. It considers the issues of legal vulnerability and needs for social-ecological data on mangroves, contributing toward systematic conservation planning and ecosystem-based management for these ecosystems.},

abstract={Landscapes are complex systems. Landscape dynamics are the result of multiple interacting biophysical and socioeconomic processes that are linked across a broad range of spatial, temporal, and organizational scales. Understanding and describing landscape dynamics poses enormous challenges and demands the use of new multiscale approaches to modeling. In this synthesis article, we present three regional systems-i.e., a forest system, a marine system, and an agricultural system and describe how hybrid, bottom-up modeling of these systems can be used to represent linkages across scales and between subsystems. Through the use of these three examples, we describe how modeling can be used to simulate emergent system responses to different conservation policy and management scenarios from the bottom up, thereby increasing our understanding of important drivers and feedback loops within a landscape. The first case study involves the use of an individual-based modeling approach to simulate the effects of forest harvesting on the movement patterns of large mammals in Canada's boreal forest and the resulting emergent population dynamics. This model is being used to inform forest harvesting and management guidelines. The second case study combines individual and agent-based approaches to simulate the dynamics of individual boats and whales in a marine park. This model is being used to inform decision-makers on how to mitigate the impacts of maritime traffic on whales in the Saint Lawrence Estuary in eastern Canada. The third example is a case study of biodiversity conservation efforts on the Eyre Peninsula, South Australia. In this example, the social-ecological system is represented as a complex network of interacting components. Methods of network analysis can be used to explore the emergent responses of the system to changes in the network structure or configuration, thus informing managers about the resilience of the system. These three examples illustrate how bottom-up modeling approaches may contribute to a new landscape science based on scenario building, to find solutions that meet the multiple objectives of integrated resource management in social-ecological systems.},

title={Conserving and restoring old growth in frequent-fire forests: Cycles of disruption and recovery},
journal={ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
year={2007},
volume={12},
number={2},
pages={NA},
month={DEC},
abstract={I provide a synthesis of the papers in the Special Issue, The Conservation and Restoration of Old Growth in Frequent-fire Forests of the American West. These papers - the product of an Old Growth Writing Workshop, held at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona on 18 - 19 April 2006 represent the ideas of 25 workshop participants who argue for a new attitude toward managing old growth in the frequent-fire forests of the American West. Unlike the lush, old-growth rainforests of the Pacific Northwest, the dry, frequent-fire forests of the western United States evolved with surface fires that disturbed the system with such regularity that young trees were almost always killed. When saplings did survive, they grew beyond the harm of frequent surface fires and, ultimately, attained the characteristics that define old growth in these systems. This system worked well, producing old-growth trees in abundance, until the onset of Euro-American settlement in the mid-to late-19(th) century. The arrival of these settlers put in motion an interplay of unprecedented social, political, economic, and ecological forces ( e. g., removal of Native Americans and their fire-based land management systems, overgrazing of the understory, aggressive logging, establishment of federal land management agencies, implementation of a federal fire suppression policy). These activities have culminated in 1) overly dense forested ecosystems that are now on the verge of collapse because of catastrophic fires ( i.e., crown fire at the landscape level; the Rodeo-Chediski Fire) and insect outbreaks, 2) the emergence of conservation-minded environmental legislation and policy, and 3) greater levels of interaction between citizens, federal agencies, and fire-prone landscapes. Recognizing the tenuous ecological situation of these forests, restoration ecologists, foresters, and others have developed ways to return historic ecological processes and lower tree densities to these forests. However, their efforts are not without challenges, including working with communities and citizens, serving as a bridge between entrenched bureaucracies ( i.e., federal agencies and environmental groups), balancing both ecological and economic interests, and producing new applied technologies and science-based policy to advance conservation and restoration efforts aimed at preserving and developing old growth within a healthy forest environment.},

journal={ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REVIEW},

pages={NA},
month={JAN},
abstract={Since the pattern of fine dust pollution varies regionally, it is necessary to identify areas vulnerable to fine dust pollution based on local community and environmental infrastructure and then plan green infrastructure for these areas. The purpose of this study is to analyze the suitability area of green infrastructure systems to improve urban resilience with regards to fine dust pollution. Regarding the research methods, first, a search for previous studies is conducted to establish an evaluation index for the resilience to fine dust pollution. Second, data on the environmental and social factors of the case study site (Suwon, Republic of Korea) are collected and mapped based on the resilience evaluation indices established for fine dust pollution. Third, these indices are used to confirm that regional differences caused by landscape fragmentation exist with regards to resilience to fine dust pollution. This study yields two key outcomes. Firstly, the indicators associated with resilience against fine dust pollution are categorized into environmental and social factors. Environmental factors encompass the composition of pollutants (including concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, NO2, O3, CO, and SO2), proximity to roads, and environmental assets such as well-established roadside green spaces, parks, forests, and thriving vegetation. Meanwhile, social factors incorporate considerations of social welfare services and air pollutant emission facilities. These factors contribute to the comprehensive evaluation indices, encompassing exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity concerning fine dust pollution. Secondly, the spatial analysis of fine dust pollution within the case study area reveals that regions exhibiting robust social-ecological system adaptive capacities tend to demonstrate heightened resilience against fine dust pollution. Conversely, areas characterized by elevated exposure and sensitivity to this issue exhibit reduced resilience. Moreover, the investigation into landscape fragmentation highlights a strong correlation between resilience against fine dust pollution and the fragmentation of green spaces. This study deviates from previous research endeavors through its innovative approach of strategically planning green infrastructure in vulnerable zones, aligning with local characteristics. It further introduces distinct resilience evaluation indicators tailored to fine dust pollution and integrates considerations of the spatial distribution of social-ecological systems, thereby contributing to a nuanced understanding of this complex issue.},

title={Cultural drivers of reforestation in tropical forest groves of the Western Ghats of India},
journal={FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT},
year={2014},
volume={329},

month={OCT 1},
abstract={Sacred forest groves in the Western Ghats of India are small fragments of tropical forest that have received protection due to religious beliefs and cultural practices. These forest fragments are an example of community-based conservation and they serve as refugia for many forest-dwelling species in otherwise highly anthropogenic tropical forest-agriculture landscapes of the Indian Western Ghats. Many of these sacred forest groves are considered ancient woodlands, but there is very little information on their origins. For instance: How old are these sacred groves? Are they relics of forest that was once continuous or are they patches of regenerated vegetation? How do changes in the surrounding landscape influence the vegetation in these groves? Based on palaeoecological reconstruction in two such sacred forest groves, we determined the age of these forest fragments. Both reconstructions indicate transition from non-forest open landscape to tree-covered landscape at these sites. These finding from two sacred groves challenge the common perception that sacred forest groves are remnants of once-continuous forest; instead, some sacred groves such as those studied might be regenerated forest patches that are approximately 400 years old. This further raises a number of questions about the drivers of reforestation in these groves. What were the social and cultural circumstances which led to the recovery of forest within these patches? How did land tenure influence forest recovery? What role did religious beliefs play in forest restoration? Using Wallace's (1956) framework of `cultural revitalization' and based on historical literature and palaeoecological analysis of the two sacred groves, this paper examines the drivers of reforestation in the Western Ghats of India. It suggests various social, ecological and economic drivers of such revitalization, recognizing strong linkages between the `social' and the `ecological' within the social-ecological system of sacred forest groves. This example of reforestation suggests that contemporary restoration of forests needs to operate at a landscape scale and look at restoration as a social-ecological intervention in forest management.

title={Analysis of Olive Grove Destruction by <i>Xylella fastidiosa</i> Bacterium on the Land Surface Temperature in Salento Detected Using Satellite Images},
journal={FORESTS},
year={2021},
volume={12},
number={9},
pages={NA},
month={SEP},
abstract={Agricultural activity replaces natural vegetation with cultivated land and it is a major cause of local and global climate change. Highly specialized agricultural production leads to extensive monoculture farming with a low biodiversity that may cause low landscape resilience. This is the case on the Salento peninsula, in the Apulia Region of Italy, where the Xylella fastidiosa bacterium has caused the mass destruction of olive trees, many of them in monumental groves. The historical land cover that characterized the landscape is currently in a transition phase and can strongly affect climate conditions. This study aims to analyze how the destruction of olive groves by X. fastidiosa affects local climate change. Land surface temperature (LST) data detected by Landsat 8 and MODIS satellites are used as a proxies for microclimate mitigation ecosystem services linked to the evolution of the land cover. Moreover, recurrence quantification analysis was applied to the study of LST evolution. The results showed that olive groves are the least capable forest type for mitigating LST, but they are more capable than farmland, above all in the summer when the air temperature is the highest. The differences in the average LST from 2014 to 2020 between olive groves and farmland ranges from 2.8 degrees C to 0.8 degrees C. Furthermore, the recurrence analysis showed that X. fastidiosa was rapidly changing the LST of the olive groves into values to those of farmland, with a difference in LST reduced to less than a third from the time when the bacterium was identified in Apulia six years ago. The change generated by X. fastidiosa started in 2009 and showed more or less constant behavior after 2010 without substantial variation; therefore, this can serve as the index of a static situation, which can indicate non-recovery or non-transformation of the dying olive groves. Failure to restore the initial environmental conditions can be connected with the slow progress of the uprooting and replacing infected plants, probably due to attempts to save the historic aspect of the landscape by looking for solutions that avoid uprooting the diseased plants. This suggests that social-ecological systems have to be more responsive to phytosanitary epidemics and adapt to ecological processes, which cannot always be easily controlled, to produce more resilient landscapes and avoid unwanted transformations.},

title={What do scientists and managers know about soil biodiversity? Comparative knowledge mapping for sustainable forest management},
journal={FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS},
year={2020},
volume={119},
number={NA},
pages={NA},
month={OCT},
abstract={Soil biodiversity is crucial for maintaining forest health and safeguarding forest ecosystem services delivery, but it is under increasing human pressure. Forest management puts pressure on soil biodiversity, but has also the potential to support soil biodiversity recovery, depending on which decisions forest managers make. These decisions are highly influenced by managers' perception and understanding. Nevertheless, insights into forest managers' understanding of soils and their biodiversity are largely lacking. This paper addresses this gap by studying private and public forest managers' understanding of soil biodiversity and comparing their level of knowledge with scientists' knowledge. In addition, this paper assesses the effects of context on understanding by comparing between two regions (NW of Flanders, Belgium, and NE of Romania). Specifically, knowledge was elicited using semi-structured interviews based on an integrated framework. The interviews were coded and analyzed using a Fuzzy Cognitive Mapping approach. In total, 24 interviews were conducted after selecting respondents using a purposive sampling design. Our results indicate that forest managers are aware of the crucial role of soil biodiversity and possess practical and context-specific understanding, but lack in-depth knowledge related to ecosystem processes and functions and soil state variables, compared to scientists. In addition, managers did not seem to explicitly consider soil biodiversity in their management decisions, but instead seemed to treat soil more as a black box. While scientists had a more detailed understanding, their understanding also depended on their background as researchers and mostly overlooked practical, site-specific implications. Moreover, we found that local context influenced respondents' understanding, especially related to drivers and pressures that affect soil biodiversity. Hence, communication strategies oriented towards forest managers seem suitable to maximize adoption of adaptive management practices that support soil biodiversity. These strategies should go beyond awareness raising and specifically explain ecosystem processes and functions linked to forest soil biodiversity to improve managers' in-depth understanding, while taking their socio-economic and forestry context into account. Further, policy design should enhance conditions for knowledge exchange and discussion about soil biodiversity. The methodology presented in this study might help such knowledge integration of scientists and forest managers in order to combine in-depth understanding of soil biodiversity and applicability of management practices in specific forest contexts.},

abstract={The challenge of decision-making under a changing climate in forestry has become a decent part in debates and in scientific discourses. This paper uses a socio-scientific approach to this topic. It is examined, if and how forest's actors identify risk due to forestry in climate change. For this purpose a four year lasting stakeholder project has been analysed. In this project, actors of the forest policy area were invited to discuss in a dialog forum central aspects of future forestry in Germany due to changing climate conditions and rising uncertainties. The group consisted of representatives of forest owners (state, municipal, private), conservation and environmental organizations as well as authorities, timber industry and research centers (Tab. 1). The debates took place as a round table; identification of topics to discuss was committed to stakeholders themselves (Tab. 2). All debates were lined by scientific or expert input. The actors have been identified before in an `analysis of discourse field', a method which helps to minimize subjective bias in determine a discourse arena. This turned out to be a reasonable method for identifying actors. For this paper all six workshops held in the project have been examined under aspects of risk research. It was examined, which risks are identified by stakeholders concerning future forestry in a changing climate. Therefore, a category scheme has been established in accordance with principles of social science (openness, naturalistics), defining following risk types: physic, economic and social (Tab. 3). Analysis of the workshops showed, that especially physical and economical risks have been addressed by stakeholders. Also addressed but not as prominently have been aspects of social risks. Concerning identified physical risks (loss of trees, diseases, etc.) actors agreed due to urgency. As economical risks, loss of cultivation area and investments in an unknown future have been identified. When social function of forests is endangered or limited, social risks are identified. A category scheme is indispensable for analyzing data, but in reality some risks are connected cascading. During research it turned out that results can be more precise, if singular risks of a cascading risk complex are evaluated by actors interested in this risk and not by the whole group together, as it happened in the presented study. In addition it can be helpful to focus on local level instead of regional to effectuate a higher identification of actors with the dealing topic.},

abstract={Mountain rice terrace agriculture is a critical land use practice in southern China. Analyzing the vertical structure of rice terraces systems and the coupled evolution of their human-land relationship from a mountainous stereoscopic perspective is significant to regional resource use and sustainable agricultural development. This study took the Xijiang Township and Jiabang Township in the mountainous area of Southwest China as the research object, based on the unique rice farming environment in the mountainous region, to divide the typical types of the four-element isomorphic (FEI) of the regional forest, village, river, and rice terraces from the perspective of vertical differentiation. The spatiotemporal evolution characteristics of rice terraces based on the view of the social-ecological system were explored by using the land use data of Jiabang Township from 1962 (1977 in Xijiang Township) to 2020, and methods such as mathematical statistics, sample transect analysis. The ecological risk model was also employed to analyze the spatiotemporal variation characteristics and landscape stability of ecological risk in mountain rice terraces systems. The study showed that: (1) The rice terraces showed the ``forestterraces-village-river{''} (F-T-V-R), ``forest-village-terraces-river{''} (F-V-T-R), and ``forest-terraces-village-terracesriver{''} (F-T-V-T-R), and the rice terraces in each differentiation type experienced a continuous evolutionary feature of ``development-stabilization-local shrinkage and shifted.{''} (2) The mixed production trend of ``main rice and the auxiliary dry land{''} in the rice terraces landscape was gradually highlighted, and the degree of landscape abandonment and fragmentation was deepened, and the ``F-T-V-T-R{''} structure had the highest landscape stability in long-term development. (3) The ecological risks of each landscape type showed the characteristics of ``increase-stabilization-decrease{''} in different time series evolution. (4) Although the ``F-T-V-T-R{''} landscape types in the two areas were at a high-risk level in the long term, the long-term changes are less fluctuating, and the landscape security stability is the highest. The research results comprehensively reflected the spatiotemporal evolution characteristics of the landscape spatial pattern of rice terraces, and revealed the reflection of the FEI vertical differentiation structure on the regional social ecosystem and human-land relationship, which can help us to promote the optimal utilization of traditional rice terraces resources in the mountains and promote the sustainable development of rice agriculture.},

abstract={Rural households in developing countries often depend on non-timber forest products (NTFPs), including foods, traditional medicines, fuelwood, fodder, and construction and craft materials such as bamboo and rattan, for their livelihoods, but the forests that supply NTFPs are subject to competition from other land uses. NTFP collectors who are unable to sustain their livelihoods because of changes caused in the NTFP collection environment by deforestation and degradation may even convert surrounding forests to agricultural land to compensate for their reduced incomes. This feedback loop of deforestation and degradation can create further conflicts among natural resource users and undermine long-term development goals. Here, we aimed to advance the discussion of forest conservation interventions in protected areas in developing countries-particularly the discussion of patrolling strategies in and around existing wildlife sanctuaries-by presenting a new approach that uses the case of NTFP collection and a human geography perspective. We used a structured questionnaire composed of closed questions to measure the awareness of village households of the impacts of deforestation and/or illegal extraction of trees on NTFP collection over a short period of time (2014-2016) near the Prey Long Wildlife Sanctuary in the eastern part of the Kampong Thom Province, Cambodia. Our survey was based on the conceptual framework of Bohensky and Lynam (Ecol. Soc. 10, 11; 2005) that people in complex adaptive systems change their behaviour after becoming aware of the impact or consequences of a change. The probability of a village having an affected household (i.e., a household that was aware of the impact) was predicted by using generalized linear mixed models. By using identified geospatial indicators of environmental and socioeconomic aspects, including distance between the village and the wildlife sanctuary, size of deforested area per capita in 2014-2016 within a 10-km radius of the village and proportion of households in the village that collect NTFPs for cash income, we predicted the spatial distribution of villages with affected NTFP-collecting households. Priority areas for NTFP collection were then mapped with reference to the identified indicators. By using these results, we present an approach to breaking the deforestation feedback loop by identifying priority areas for patrolling and other forest conservation interventions in the wildlife sanctuary.},

month={MAY},
abstract={CONTEXT: In Madagascar land use pressure on natural resources has increased drastically over the last decades. For subsistence farmers this situation often leads to an accelerated unsustainable exploitation of resources with negative consequences for their livelihood, which can be described as a social-ecological trap (SET). OBJECTIVE: Our paper seeks to understand the dynamics of SETs and demonstrates a model-driven scenario on how farmers may escape the trap. For this, we developed a spatially explicit empirical agent-based model (SEALM) to simulate possible future trends of farmers? crop management and the effects of these trends on the environment, household (HH) economy, food self-sufficiency (FSS) and HH coping strategies to food insecurity. METHODS: Using links between social-ecological system (SES) components that depict real-world conditions, SEALM focuses on three village communities for which extensive data were available from transdisciplinary research comprising surveys, remote sensing analysis, and field-based validation. To identify the most significant parameters and to quantify how parameter uncertainty influences model outcomes, local and global sensitivity analyses were performed. Simulations were conducted in annual time steps from 2015 to 2045 to depict two contrasting scenarios: A baseline scenario (A) and an improved crop management scenario to increase FSS (B). For scenario assessments we used direct simulation outputs (FSS, HH income, land cover) and further indices calculated based on model outcomes (coping strategy index, landscape fragmentation, and the Gini coefficient). RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Scenario A predicted expansion of cropland and fragmentation of remaining forest areas. Simulations at each time step displayed how SET situations occurred due to self-reinforcing ecological and social constraints and affected HHs future coping capacity to food shortages. Here, FSS was insufficient (< 1.0) for most HHs and was <0.5 for years with rainfall deficits. Scenario B demonstrated a way to navigate out of the SET by increasing crop yields reflecting improved management and resulting in significantly higher FSS values and a lower coping strategy index. SEALM considers the heterogeneity in farmers? abilities, constraints, behaviour and decision-making and depicts the dynamic interplay of SES components contributing to SET. SIGNIFICANCE: SEALM serves as a discussion support with local stakeholders and experts and it allows to better tailor site specific land use recommendations due to its empirical driven and spatially explicit character. However, strategies and interventions that lower the poverty rate in the long term and encourage exit out of trap situations require major policy changes.},

abstract={This study addresses the ongoing debate on forest land-sparing vs land-sharing, aiming to identify effective strategies for both species conservation and timber exploitation. Previous studies, guided by control theory, compared sharing and sparing by optimizing logging intensity along a presumed trade -off between timber yield and ecological outcomes. However, the realism of this trade -off assumption is questioned by ecological and governance theories. This article introduces a mathematical model of Social-Ecological System (SES) dynamics, distinguishing selective logging intensification between sharing and sparing, with associated governance requirements. The model assumes consistent rules for logging, replanting, conservation support, access regulation, socio-economic, soil and climate conditions. Actors, each specialized in sustainable logging and replanting of a single species, coexist with various tree species in the same space for land sharing, contrasting with separate actions on monospecific stands for sparing. In sharing scenarios, a gradient of intensification is created from 256 combinations of selective logging for a forest with eight coexisting tree species. This is compared with eight scenarios of monospecific stands adjacent to a spared eight-species forest area safeguarded from logging. Numerical projections over 100 years rank sparing and sharing options based on forest-level tree biodiversity, carbon storage, and timber yield. The findings underscore the context-specific nature of the problem but identify simple heuristics to optimize both sparing and sharing practices. Prioritizing the most productive tree species is effective when selecting sparing, especially when timber yield and biodiversity are benchmarks. Conversely, sharing consistently outperforms sparing when carbon storage and biodiversity are main criteria. Sharing excels across scenarios considering all three criteria, provided a greater diversity of actors access and coexist in the shared space under collective rules ensuring independence and sustainable logging and replanting. The present model addresses some limitations in existing sparing-sharing theory by aligning with established ecological theories exploring the intricate relationship between disturbance practices, productivity and ecological outcomes. The findings also support a governance hypothesis from the 2009 Nobel Prize in Economics (E. Ostrom) regarding the positive impact on biodiversity and productivity of increasing polycentricity, i.e., expanding the number of independent species controllers' channels (loggers/ replanters/supporters/regulators). This hypothesis, rooted in Ashby's law of requisite variety from control theory, suggests that resolving the sharing/sparing dilemma may depend on our ability to predict the yield -ecology performances of sparing (in heterogeneous landscapes) vs of sharing (in the same space) from their respective levels of ``polycentric requisite variety{''},

abstract={BackgroundPlot-based monitoring has yielded much information on the taxonomic diversity and carbon (C) storage in tropical lowland forests of the Amazon basin. This has resulted in an improved understanding of the relationship between lowland forest biomass dynamics and global change drivers, such as climate change and atmospheric CO2 concentration. Much less attention has been paid to the mountain ecosystems of South America that comprise montane forests and alpine vegetation (paramo, puna, high Andean grasslands, wetlands, and alpine heath). This vegetation complex provides a variety of ecosystem services and forms a natural laboratory along various physiographic, geological and evolutionary history/biogeography, and land use history gradients.AimsHere, we review existing empirical understanding and model-based approaches to quantify the contribution of mountain ecosystems to ecosystem service provision in the rapidly changing socioecological setting of the South American mountains. The objective of this paper is to outline a broad road map for the implementation of mountain vegetation into dynamic global vegetation models (DGVM) for use in Earth System Models (ESM), based on our current understanding of their structure and function and of their responsiveness to global change drivers. We also identify treeline processes, critical in mountain ecosystems, as key missing elements in DGVMs/ESMs, and thus explore in addition a treeline model.MethodsStocktaking of the availability of empirical data was undertaken from eight research sites along the Andes and in south-eastern Brazil. Out of eight sites, two (one each in Venezuela and Brazil) had some climate, ecological and ecophysiological data potentially suitable to parametrise a DGVM. Tree biomass data were available for six sites. A preliminary assessment of the Joint UK Land Environment Simulator (JULES) DGVM was made to identify gaps in available data and their impacts on model parametrisation and calibration. Additionally, the potential climate-determined elevation of the treeline was modelled to check the DGVM for its ability to identify the transition between the montane forest and alpine vegetation.ResultsOutcomes of the evaluation of the JULES land surface model identified the following key processes in montane forests: temperature-related decrease in net primary production, respiration, and allocation to above-ground biomass and increase in soil C stocks with elevation. There was a variable agreement between simulated biomass and those derived from field measurements via allometric equations.ConclusionsWe identified major gaps between data availability and the needs for process-based modelling of South American mountain vegetation and its dynamics in DGVMs. To bridge this gap, we propose a transdisciplinary network, composed of members of the theoretical/modelling and empirical scientific communities, to study the natural dynamics of mountain ecosystems and their responses to global change drivers locally, regionally and at the continental scale, within a social-ecological system framework. The work presented here forms the basis for the design of data collection from field measurements and instrumental monitoring stations to parametrise and verify DGVMs. The network is designed to collaborate with and complement existing long-term research initiatives in the region and will adopt existing standard field protocols. Complementary protocols will ensure compatibility between field data collection and data needed for process-based and empirical models.},

abstract={In recent decades, ecosystem theory has revisited the meaning of human action. There is a growing tendency to recognize that, once ``left alone{''}, human modified ecosystems do not return to their primitive state. Recently, this notion has been radically advocated by a group of ecologists who propose the concept of ``emerging{''} or ``novel{'' ecosystems. Emerging ecosystems are the direct result of either intense human modification of preserved ecosystems or the abandonment of established land uses (crops, pastures, planted forests etc.). These ecosystems present locally unprecedented patterns of species composition and dominance that don't depend on human intervention for its maintenance. Therefore these novel ecosystems ``exist as a non-regressive consequence of human activity{'' In addressing the current manifestations of novel ecosystems, we adopt the retrospective method of historical geography, taking the landscape not only as a means but also as an end; more than mere instrument of knowledge, it is the object of knowledge. In this case, we visit the past only to fetch the explanatory elements of the present. Adopting this strategy, we proceed in the same way that natural scientists working in the evolutionary field (geologists, paleontologists, etc.): performing a ``remote sensing of processes through surviving structures{''}. More specifically, we use present residual structures (e.g. novel ecosystems) to reconstruct the past processes of landscape transformation. In this article, we aim to reconstruct the processes that produced two of the largest urban forests of today's world, both located in granite-gneiss massifs of Rio de Janeiro city, southeastern Brazil: Tijuca Massif and Pedra Branca Massif, both comprising, respectively, a National Park and a State Park. Currently, these two forest areas have particular ecological characteristics. Hiking on the slopes of Tijuca, it is easy to find whole tracts dominated by the exotic jackfruit (Artocarpus heterophyllus Lam.), which had been originally introduced in those slopes in the mid-nineteenth century, when a reforestation project began to reclaim the lands degraded by coffee plantation and timber extraction. More hardly noticeable are the small plateaus of blackened soil, evidence of an ancient industry, essential to the past urban economy: charcoal manufacture. The residues of this activity, however, are much more common in the west, in Pedra Branca. There, one of the authors has discovered, through archaeological work, over a thousand old charcoal kilns with a local influence in species composition and dominance. To notice the conspicuous presence of the banana (Musa paradisiaca L.), however, one needs no digging. Planted decades ago in any place accessible by a mule - on the backs of which the succulent and nutritious fruits traveled to less rugged terrain, where they were collected by trucks - many of these herbs-that-want-to-be-trees remain in the landscape after being abandoned by their growers, generating hybrid banana-forest systems. These are examples of how human societies as they spatialize themselves - a necessary condition of their existence in time -, leave behind the clues to their own historical intelligibility. However, this dynamic of social reproduction and understanding would never be possible if only humans were involved. Human beings and their societies emerge as such only in an open and dynamic relationship with what is non-human - other animals, plants, minerals etc., and their particular ways of being. In other words, these are more-than-human social regimes whose development is dependent on both human agency and earth systems. Thus, the emerging ecosystem approach constitutes a new way of ``reading{''} the landscape, one that weaves together the human and non-human worlds into a coherent environmental history of the present social-ecological system.},

abstract={Exploring the coupled and coordinated development of social-ecological systems is an important basis for promoting integrated watershed management. Based on the framework of the social-ecological system of lake water environment governance, this study builds an evaluation index system for quantifying the coupling and coordination of the social-ecological system, selects the representative key variables in each component of the socialecological system, and evaluates the coupling and coordination changes in the social-ecological system of Taihu lake water environment governance from 1987 to 2020. This study uses the coupling coordination degree model (CCDM) and the obstacle degree model (ODM) to reveal the dynamic relationship between the coupling degree (CD), the coupling coordination degree (CCD), and their obstacle factors of the social-ecological system of lake water environment governance. The results show that: (1) The comprehensive social system development level shows an uptrend, while ecological subsystem shows a decreasing and then increasing trend. With the development of social economy, water environment has experienced the process of deterioration followed by recovery. (2) CD and CCD both show a downward trend first and then an upward trend. CD ranges from 0.71 to 0.98, its status had fluctuated between high-quality coupling stage and break-in stage. CCD ranges from 0.42 to 0.58, its status had fluctuated between near maladjustment recession and critical coordination stage. (3) The average obstacle degrees of the ecosystem and the social system are 0.51 and 0.49, the strong human activity interference in the social system and the vulnerability of the ecosystem and uncertainty jointly affects the CCD. Therefore, to improve the CCD of the social-ecological system of lake water environment governance, it is recommended that attention should be paid to the use and treatment of water resources in the process of social and economic development of the basin, and the amount of external pollution into the lake should be controlled in many ways. This study can help to understand the coupled social-ecological system interactions of Taihu lake water environment governance and provide a scientific basis for decision-makers.},

abstract={The social-ecological system is receiving more and more attention, and water resources have been a focal point for linking social systems and ecosystems, but how to clarify the regional social-ecological system coupling process through the water flow perspective and how to make ecosystem services management decisions still needs further re-search. This study integrates water quantity and quality and proposes a water-related ecosystem services flow frame-work. This study applied the framework to the Wuding River watershed and simulated water quantity and quality by SWAT model. The results showed that: (1) there is significant spatial heterogeneity in ecosystem service provisioning and meaningful improvement in water quality under the function of human-made capital in the green phase of the eco-system services flow; (2) in the red phase, beneficiaries use the water supply for their production and life and discharge >7400 tons pollution loads into the ecosystem; (3) in this process, human-made capital reduces about 35 \% of the am-monia pollution, and meanwhile, the ecosystem relies on its environment to further clean up about 44 \% of the load. The research framework is suitable for watershed social-ecological systems with simplistic interactions, guiding eco-logical compensation schemes and related management policies. Furthermore, providing a scientific basis for the sus-tainable use of regional water resources.},

abstract={Water scarcity is a global issue due to climate change and increasing water demand. Water pricing policy is a critical instrument to stimulate farmers' water-saving actions. Different types of water-saving behaviors are closely related and interactional. It is thus necessary to study multiple water-saving behaviors together and their dynamic transformation with intensification of policy shock. Besides, whether the policy could work well depends much on the social-ecological system where farmers are embedded. This paper studies how social-ecological system impacts farmers' choice from multiple water-saving strategies and their shift of response strategies with further increase in water price. A field survey was conducted in semi-arid area of northwestern China that has suffered from severe water shortage and human-land conflicts for a long time. The results show that adoption of active-negative strategy rather than passive water-saving strategy is affected by productivity and predictability of resource system, number of users, norms, social capital, and collective choice rules. Adoption of active-positive strategy depends much on relative size and productivity of resource system, predictability of system dynamics, mobility of resource units, number of users, norms, social capital, and monitoring and sanctioning process. However, their effects have disparities, or are even opposite under different intensities of policy shock. When policy shock intensifies, mobility of resource units, number of users, resource importance, and monitoring and sanctioning process are identified as key factors to degrade farmers' water-saving strategy rather than maintain their original strategy. Both the size of resource system and the quality of social network promote farmers to upgrade response strategy. The results indicate that there is a complicated relationship between policy shock and water-saving responses in the framework of social-ecological system, explained by a series of mechanisms. The findings provide valuable implications for optimizing water pricing mechanism, designing targeted measures, and developing effective governance environment.},

abstract={Big river basins are complex systems of people and nature. This article explores the resilience of nine case studies of big river basins. A system description and generic conceptual model suggests that resilience to changes in water quantity is critical. When water becomes limiting, the social-ecological system must adapt rapidly if key elements (for example, communities, biodiversity) are to be maintained. Water limitation imposes a water economy and alters political and institutional links between actors. Pro-active management for resilience demands politically acceptable participatory processes that use the best possible science and incorporate social, ecological and economic elements in problem definition and solution.},

journal={JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY},
year={2024},
volume={629},

pages={NA},
month={FEB},
abstract={Water governance in river basins worldwide faces challenges due to complex socio-economic and environmental factors. In the Yellow River Basin (YRB), two major institutional shifts, the 1987 Water Allocation Scheme (87-WAS) and the 1998 Unified Basin Regulation (98-UBR), aimed to address water allocation and usage issues. This study quantifies the net effects of these institutional shifts on water use within the YRB and analyzes the underlying reasons for their success or failure. We employ a Differenced Synthetic Control method to assess the impacts of the institutional shifts. Our analysis suggests that the 87-WAS unexpectedly increased water use by 5.75\%, while the 98-UBR successfully reduced water use as anticipated. Our research highlights the role of institutional structures in governance policies, demonstrating that the mismatched structure of the 87-WAS led to increased competition and exploitation of water resources, while the 98-UBR, basin-wide authority and stronger connections between stakeholders, resulted in improved water governance. Our study underscores the importance of designing institutions that are consistent with the scale of the ecological system, promote cooperation among stakeholders, and adapt to changing social-ecological system (SES) contexts. As outdated and inflexible water quotas may no longer meet the demands of sustainable development in the YRB, policymakers must consider the potential consequences of institutional shifts and their impact on water use and sustainability.},

abstract={The study addresses health-associated risks and health indicators required for the framing of Social-Ecological System Health (SESH) in aquaculture food-producing systems. The advantages of using a healthy Social-Ecological System (SES) are highlighted, to aid in the development of a new ecological system fostering the sustainability of aquatic ecosystems. The study used statistic modelling of some human infections with Cryptosporidium spp. and Cyclospora spp., used to obtain an estimate of the costs of zoonoses to health systems, and the outcomes of an epidemiological study involving the Eustrongylides spp. in fish. The study indicated that parasitic zoonoses have an important economic impact on health systems, environment and society at large. Holistic approaches to health, addressing all relevant actors are required to mitigate these impacts. To address the risk of eustrongylides and other fish-, and water-borne zoonoses, the development of new social-ecological system health should be constructed. For aquaculture production, such systems must include a biosecurity plan co-developed and negotiated by all relevant stakeholders. While the system's feasibility is yet to be validated, regular revision of such systems' functioning and outputs is an important premise to make them operational.},

abstract={The object of this article is the drinking water infrastructure (DWI), a critical societal infrastructure. To make effective decisions it is important to characterise and understand the complexity of DWI systems. DWI systems can be seen as a system of systems, consisting of the social-ecological system and the social-technical system. The social-ecological system determines the location and seize of the water resources, while the social-technical system is about the technical infrastructure. The two systems with different characteristics must align to work effective together in the DWI system. The tension between different lifecycles of the assets and dynamic changes in both systems, the time of change, is important to take into account. The SoPhyTech infra framework was developed based on the two systems and time of change. The advantages of applying the SoPhyTech infra framework is studied in a case comparing two very different DWI systems: Indonesia (Semarang) and the Netherlands (Vitens). The SoPhyTech infra framework was shown to be effective for characterising a DWI system with different interacting lifecycles in different systems and it is expected that it also can be used to characterise other infrastructure systems.},

abstract={The resilience perspective, which emphasizes the integrated, systemic concept of human and nature interactions, is increasingly used as an approach for understanding the dynamic of social-ecological system. As the water resources system (WRS) is a social-ecological system, resilience thinking such as Holling's adaptive cycle has been adopted as a fundamental unit for understanding the water resources system dynamics in this paper. In the adaptive cycle of WRS, the likelihood shift among different phases largely depends on resilience value; and a quantitative method for estimating the resilience of WRS is proposed. The method is related to the degree of change and characteristics of the WRS, and has been applied to identify the phase of WRS in every city in Zhejiang province, China. The results of resilience assessment have also been discussed in terms of adaptive cycle.},

abstract={Groundwater resources are essential for the supply of drinking water in the European Union but significant uncertainties surround their quality. In this context, our article analyzes the factors that influence the cooperation of key stakeholders to prevent the risk of diffuse pollution from agriculture. We built on the institutional rational choice approach and the social-ecological system framework to design our analytical framework and hypotheses. We applied this analytical framework to two cases of cooperation involving drinking water suppliers and farmers in the management of the risk of non-point source pollution from agriculture in France. Our results show that cooperation emerges when the water resource is important for water suppliers to take on the leadership. Our results also characterize the role played by uncertainties and risk in getting stakeholders involved, and finally, suggest that cooperation depends on the size and predictability of the resource system.},

abstract={Agricultural watersheds are affected by changes in climate, land use, agricultural practices, and human demand for energy, food, and water resources. In this context, we analyzed the agricultural, urbanizing Yahara watershed ( size: 1345 km(2), population: 372,000) to assess its responses to multiple changing drivers. We measured recent trends in land use/cover and water quality of the watershed, spatial patterns of 10 ecosystem services, and spatial patterns and nestedness of governance. We developed scenarios for the future of the Yahara watershed by integrating trends and events from the global scenarios literature, perspectives of stakeholders, and models of biophysical drivers and ecosystem services. Four qualitative scenarios were created to explore plausible trajectories to the year 2070 in the watershed's social-ecological system under different regimes: no action on environmental trends, accelerated technological development, strong intervention by government, and shifting values toward sustainability. Quantitative time-series for 2010-2070 were developed for weather and land use/cover during each scenario as inputs to model changes in ecosystem services. Ultimately, our goal is to understand how changes in the social-ecological system of the Yahara watershed, including management of land and water resources, can build or impair resilience to shifting drivers, including climate.},

abstract={In this study we demonstrate how to support policy option analysis for a problematic Social-Ecological System (SES) with the help of stakeholder participation. SES sustainability problems 1) are highly complex, 2) may lack reliable data, 3) encompass conflicting interests and 4) may require contradictory management interventions. Our approach uses a structured participatory method combining the Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) model together with Fuzzy Cognitive Mapping (FCM) to capture the complexity of the system and simplify its representation for simulation and policy option analysis. Using this novel mixed-method was useful in dealing with above-mentioned characteristics of the complex SES problems. The method was applied in a case study of water scarcity in Rafsanjan, Iran. FCMs were produced for 60 individual farmers and 40 individual researchers and policy makers. Our mixed-method analysis reveals similarities and differences of stakeholder knowledge and problem perception, and simulates the impacts of alternative policy options according to each group's perception. The final result of our case study indicates that farmers in Rafsanjan strongly believe in the impact of economic diversification on reducing water shortage, but they have a low level of trust in the ability of the government to regulate and control water usage, whereas the policy makers and researchers still believe in the role of government control and monitoring policies to deal with water scarcity in Rafsanjan.

title={The Land-Water-Food Nexus: Expanding the Social-Ecological System Framework to Link Land and Water Governance},
journal={RESOURCES-BASEL},
year={2017},
volume={6},
number={3},
pages={NA},
month={SEP},
abstract={To date, the land-water-food nexus has been primarily addressed from an ecological, hydrological or agronomic angle, with limited response to the governance interface between the input resources. Likewise, in widely used heuristic frameworks, such as the social-ecological system (SES) framework, governance interactions between resources are not sufficiently addressed. We address this gap empirically, using the case of Tajikistan, based on a farm household survey analysis of 306 farmers. The results indicate that land system variables contribute to the willingness to cooperate in irrigation management. Specifically, formal land tenure has a positive effect on farmers paying for water as well as on the likelihood of their investing time and effort in irrigation infrastructure, which is decisive for Tajikistan's food and fiber production. Irrigation system variables show that, e.g., being an upstream user increases the likelihood to contribute to labor maintenance efforts. We further discuss how decisions with respect to the land sector could be designed in the future to facilitate cooperation in other resource sectors. Further, we conclude from a conceptual perspective that the SES framework integrating a nexus perspective can be adapted: either (1) by adding a second-tier governance nexus variable inside the governance variable of an irrigation system; or (2) by adding a land resource unit and system outside the irrigation system.},

title={Defining and evaluating the social value of regional water resources in terms of emergy},
journal={WATER POLICY},
year={2019},
volume={21},
number={1},
pages={73-90},
month={FEB},
abstract={The social value of water resources must be considered when reforming water prices, improving water policy, protecting water resources and devising allocation methods. However, current social value theories for water resources are often unsound. The social value of water resources is defined here based on social system theory. Energy flow within a combined social-ecological system is analyzed, and an emergy analysis method for ecological economics is introduced for unified quantification and to improve the accounting method of the social value of water resources. Taking Zhengzhou in east-central China as an example, the social value of water resources is calculated for 2015. The water resources' total social emergy was 6.04 x 10(21) solar equivalent joules (sej) and the unit value was 6.58 x 10(12) sej/m(3). This corresponds to 3.88\$/m(3), indicating that the social value of water resources is enormous. This paper proposes that the social value of water is an important component of its ecological economic value, and its social value should therefore be considered by water policy makers. Research of this type can be effective in helping to protect water resources and encourage efficient water use.},

abstract={South Africa is a developing country undergoing social and ecological transformation. Water service delivery (i) exemplifies the challenge of improvement and transformation towards a more socially and ecologically just situation, and (ii) can usefully be viewed as a complex social-ecological system (C-SES) in the search for `just transitions'. Household water security problems associated with water service delivery in South Africa are recognisably intractable, multi-scaled, comprising many actors and elements and having no single solution. There is a global and South African trend towards systemic approaches to addressing such complex water challenges. However, the steps required to take a systemic approach are seldom explicit. This paper presents the analytical process of defining boundaries, identifying elements and exploring relationships between elements as the foundational step in a study of the Makana Local Municipality water service delivery C-SES in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa. The resulting narrative and heuristics provide a clear systemic basis from which to research the emergence, practice and social learning process of a civil society organisation (Water for Dignity) seeking to confront water service delivery issues in the Makana Local Municipality.},

abstract={Nonpoint source pollution from agriculture represents a major threat to the quality of water in the European Union (EU) context. As part of the implementation process of the EU Water Framework Directive in France, the cooperation between water suppliers and agricultural stakeholders has been recently promoted for limiting diffuse agricultural pollution at the water catchment level. Based on a conceptual framework combining transaction cost economics and the social-ecological system (SES) framework, this paper identifies the conditions under which such collective action is effective for the restoration/maintenance of water quality. The research relies on a cross-case comparison of cooperation in six drinking water catchments. A qualitative analysis of primary data collected at the national, water basin and local levels serves as a basis for the multi-case investigation. Variables related to the hydrogeological system, the stakeholders involved, the contracts governing cooperation and the economic and policy contexts are shown to interact in their influence on collective action. The results highlight the importance of the match between contract incentives and the characteristics of the local context and the potential complementarities between informational, regulatory and economic policy tools for enhancing the effectiveness of collective action for water pollution control.},

abstract={Many regional and national organisations promote the modernisation of agriculture by supporting new technologies to increase their territory's competitiveness in a free-market context. Such technologies and their associated intensive land management practices are geared towards obtaining higher yields. However, their application also entails changes in water and land management institutions, which could alter interactions among multiple components of the agrarian social-ecological system and potentially weaken the system. Here, we assess how these components and their relations change in a village situated in Navarre (Spain) after the uptake of large-scale irrigation infrastructure. Specifically, we analyse such changes by comparing how the design principles for robust social-ecological systems manifest before and after the adoption of large-scale irrigation. Our findings indicate that an unequal distribution of water and land induces some farmers to abandon their agrarian activities. Our case study also shows how irrigation communities have partially lost their autonomy to self-organise and make agrarian management-related decisions. We suggest that the adoption of large-scale irrigation in this region contributes to a decrease in cooperation among resource users, and between users and infrastructure providers. This is due to a decline in the capacity to achieve collective-choice arrangements and higher external control and monitoring of water use. We argue that the current agrarian management changes may damage social-ecological system robustness and affect the sustainable use of common-pool resources, leading farmers to maladaptation to climate and market variability.},

abstract={In this paper we attempt to integrate environmental education, with a focus on building capacity at the level of the individual, with frameworks for resilience, with a focus on adaptive capacity at the level of the social-ecological system. Whereas previous work has focused on enhancing system-level capacity through building adaptive capacity in individuals, we suggest a wider range of processes for linking individual learning with resilience in social-ecological systems. In particular, we use activity theory as a lens to examine how environmental education programs situated within adaptive co-management practices might foster learning among youth while contributing directly to environmental quality, building and distributing multiple forms of knowledge among stakeholders, and changing adult behaviors in a local watershed.},

abstract={Understanding public perceptions, values, and preferences can be fundamental to effective conservation governance, management, and outreach. This is particularly true in socially and ecologically complex marine and coastal spaces, where many relevant questions remain. The social-ecological system of Biscayne Bay and Miami-Dade are on the frontier of problems that will soon engulf many coastal-urban systems. Despite the economic, ecological, and cultural importance of Biscayne Bay, research into the social components of this social-ecological system is distinctly lacking. In order to effectively address urgent coastal management issues, practitioners and policy-makers need a clear understanding of public perceptions, values, and priorities. In this paper I present the results of a large online survey (n = 1146) exploring public attitudes toward Biscayne Bay as a case study of management and opportunity in a complex coastal social-ecological system. Results describe a public that interacts with and utilizes Biscayne Bay in a variety of ways, from leisure and recreation, to subsistence. This public believes the Bay to be moderately healthy, though somewhat in decline, and has experienced a range of local environmental threats, about which they feel considerable concern. These interactions and concerns are in turn reflected in overwhelming endorsement of value statements regarding the ecological, material, cultural and economic importance of the ecosystem to the city, as well as high levels of support for policy actions to protect and restore that ecosystem. Together these findings indicate that additional policy steps to preserve and restore Biscayne Bay would enjoy support from the local public and demonstrate the power of public perceptions research to identify gaps and opportunities for management and outreach.},

abstract={Wetlands are unique ecosystems formed by the interaction between land and water on Earth. Poyang Lake, which is a part of China's largest freshwater lake wetland, is well known for its ecological and economic importance. This study uses a social-ecological system (SES) framework that integrates watershed and human activities; we used action scenarios to analyse the influencing factors, solutions, and feedback mechanisms involved in the SES framework. We chose Nanchang, Jiujiang, and Shangrao in the Poyang Lake wetlands of the Jiangxi province as the study areas to provide a problem-oriented analytical strategy for the organic interface between ecological conservation and green development. The key issues indicate that the Poyang Lake region faces multiple problems, such as ecosystem structural changes and environmental pollution, caused by anthropological activities, inefficient implementation of conservation policies, and insufficient funding for pollution prevention and control. Our findings provide a systematic solution for major conservation and development issues in the Poyang Lake region and are adapted to the characteristics of the lake. We also provide a theoretical reference and direction for the implementation of green development and modernisation of ecological governance in the Great Lakes basin in China.},

abstract={In this paper, we frame the problem of urban water sustainability in megacities as a social-ecological system (SES) to examine the underlying coupling of social and ecological factors and processes. Based on our empirical research of two major megacities of the global south, SAo Paulo and Delhi, we have developed an urban water SES module within the broader SES framework proposed by Ostrom. The module's multilevel nested structure consists of the following four subsystems: water resource and infrastructure, settlements, governance, and actors. A distinct advantage of our module is that it enables us to capture the plurality of settlements patterns (from formal to informal settlements), actor networks, and governance patterns found in cities of the global south and how these uniquely shape and are shaped by the process of rapid urbanization. We use this module as: (a) an analytical tool to identify the different variables and processes within each subsystem, which through their interactions, have influenced the trajectory of water systems in these cities; (b) a diagnostic tool in a comparative setting to examine why desired goals in terms of service delivery and/or governance were achieved (or not); and (c) a prescriptive tool to identify cross-learnings and practical lessons.},

abstract={Rapid urbanization causes wetland ecosystem functions to degrade worldwide. This phenomenon negatively affects the resilience of ecosystem functions in the face of unexpected impacts, particularly climate change. An approach is required for combining resilience with management in a Wetland City. This study aims to model the resilience of ecosystem functions for climate change adaptation management in a Wetland City via system dy-namics from 2021 to 2100. First, we set a system boundary through expert interviews to identify the main issues in the social-ecological system of a Wetland City. Second, we constructed a social-ecological system of a Wetland City that provides ecosystem function trade-offs between flood control and wildlife habitat provisioning. Then, we simulated the resilience of ecosystem functions according to different climate change adaptative management scenarios. Finally, we determined an appropriate scenario for minimizing the impacts of ecosystem function trade-offs reinforced by climate change. As a result, we recommend that the water level should be managed such that the controlled flood water level ranges from 12 to 14 m and that 30\% of the willow areas should be thinned each year. Based on these simulation results, we proposed three climate change adaptive management strategies: considering long-term plans including short-term effects, networking with multiscale community participation, and applying sustainable wetland management to urban planning. Ultimately, this study can contribute to planning and management guidelines for a Wetland City.},

abstract={Coral reefs are threatened globally by the climatic consequences of rising atmospheric CO2 levels; in many regions they are also threatened locally, for example, by reductions in the water quality of runoff from adjacent catchments. Interaction between global and local pressures makes it possible to use local actions to mitigate the impacts of climate change. To this end, managers and policy-makers are seeking to implement agricultural land management regimes that improve runoff water quality and thereby reduce risks to the Great Barrier Reef. Although components of the Great Barrier Reef Region have been researched for some time, a systemic approach capable of representing the Region's key functional relationships as a social-ecological system is lacking. Here we provide a conceptual framework of the Great Barrier Reef social-ecological system that identifies a range of complex socioeconomic tradeoffs that may be required to maintain resilient reefs under climate change. The conceptual framework is the first step toward development of a functional analytical tool that is capable of helping policy-makers choose between alternative management actions.},

abstract={The wetlands of the Amudarya River delta in Uzbekistan provide valuable ecosystem services to the local human population which has suffered severely from the loss of the Aral Sea, desertification and the post-soviet socio-economic transition. The region is also particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change as a recent severe drought has shown. In this contribution, we assess the potential and implications of incorporating environmental flows into management of the Amudarya River for improving the provision of wetland ecosystem services and enhancing resilience of the social-ecological system to river runoff uncertainty. Our assessment is based on analyses of 1) the current vulnerability of deltaic wetlands to years of low water availability, 2) expected regional climate change and its impact on water flows to the wetlands, and 3) alternative water use options to enhance environmental flows under a changing climate. The results provide a ranking of these options with respect to their benefits for the provision of environmental flows and implications for agriculture. Their realization, however, poses challenges that cannot be tackled by technical interventions of redistribution and efficiency increase alone but call for institutional changes and moves towards multi-purpose water use. The diversification of impacts and livelihood options would allow enhancing the resilience of the social-ecological system to climate or socio-politically induced changes in water flow.

title={Ecosystem Services Linking Social and Ecological Systems: River Brownification and the Response of Downstream Stakeholders},

year={2011},
volume={16},
number={4},
pages={NA},
month={NA},
abstract={The theoretical framework of ecosystem services and that of resilience thinking are combined in an empirical case study of a social-ecological system. In the River Helge a catchment in southern Sweden, a slow increase in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) results in brownification of the water with consequences on ecosystem services in the lower part of the catchment of concern by local resource managers. An assessment of ecosystem service delivery was conducted to (1) identify plausible drivers of brownification in the study site and assess future ecosystem service delivery for stakeholders in downstream areas. An analysis of the perspective of beneficiaries, using qualitative methods, was pursued to (2) evaluate the impacts of brownification on downstream stakeholders. Our analyses of drivers of brownification in combination with climate change projections suggests that Kristianstads Vattenrike Biosphere Reserve will experience extreme water flows much more frequently than the system is accustomed to today, and that these water flows will be highly affected by brownification. The combination of severe summer flooding and high water color constituted a new disturbance regime and thus requires new adaptive strategies by local stakeholders. A range of coping and adaptation strategies were displayed by the farmers but also a possible transformation strategy, i.e., abandonment of the seasonally flooded meadows. Because hay making and grazing are central components in the active management of the Kristianstads Vattenrike Biosphere Reserve, to discontinue this practice would have system-wide ramifications for the Biosphere Reserve. The vulnerability of fishing in the culturally significant ``Eel Coast,{''} part of the downstream area, was also exposed. We argue that for environmental monitoring of slow changing variables to make sense to local stakeholders, clear links to ecosystem service benefits are required. The responsibility for this and thus for matching of social and ecological scales falls heavily on regional managers. We further argue that resilience of a social-ecological system can be estimated by observing and analyzing how local stakeholders respond to disturbances, i.e., by analyzing their response strategies.},

abstract={Current governance of regional scale water management systems in the United States has not placed them on a path toward sustainability, as conflict and gridlock characterize the social arena and ecosystem services continue to erode. Changing climate may continue this trajectory, but it also provides a catalyst for renewal of ecosystems and a window of opportunity for change in institutions. Resilience provides a bridging concept that predicts that change in ecological and social systems is often dramatic, abrupt, and surprising. Adapting to the uncertainty of climate driven change must be done in a manner perceived as legitimate by the participants in a democratic society. Adaptation must begin with the current hierarchical and fragmented social-ecological system as a baseline from which new approaches must be applied. Achieving a level of integration between ecological concepts and governance requires a dialogue across multiple disciplines, including ecologists with expertise in ecological resilience, hydrologists and climate experts, with social scientists and legal scholars. Criteria and models that link ecological dynamics with policies in complex, multi-jurisdictional water basins with adaptive management and governance frameworks may move these social-ecological systems toward greater sustainability.},

abstract={Debate continues regarding which policy instrument should be used to ensure land, water, and environmental governance that promotes the sustainability of social-ecological systems (SESs). Policy instruments and Social Ecological Systems have played important roles in the theoretical development of natural resource governance systems. They, however, have been considered in isolation from one another. This study aims to bridge between the two by interpreting policy instruments as rules of interaction in a social-ecological system. Specifically, a longitudinal study on Victorian Acts was conducted to understand how policy instruments for land, water, and environmental governances adopted from 1860 to 2016 worked in the governance of SESs. Through a content analysis of the Acts, we constructed a simple typology of the ways in which policy instruments manage components of SESs. This typology includes the reserve regime, authority regime, information regime and integration regime. The study shows the circumstances under which interactions among components of biophysical and social systems deserve attention as partial shapers of policy instruments. The present work can be used to understand, examine and reflect on policy instruments currently used for resource governance and to make strategic improvements that account for current conditions rather than adopting new policies without understanding the existing context.},

abstract={Elinor Ostrom and colleagues developed the social-ecological system framework with the aim of synthesizing knowledge to foster a better understanding of the relationship between people, institutions and the environment. Although the framework has facilitated the diagnosis of complex systems; it has thus far struggled to account for the role of history in structuring the range of opportunities and constraints that actors face as they interact with the environment and each other. More recent innovations in measuring institutions and the integration of process-oriented approaches are beginning to provide the tools required to systematically trace the co-evolution of institutions and social-ecological systems. We review the history and development of social-ecological system scholarship, including longstanding concerns regarding the weak inclusion of temporal dynamics. We highlight the contributions of three novel advances - namely the combined IAD-SES framework, the institutional grammar tool, and the power in polycentric governance approach.},

abstract={Diverse public policies encourage farmers to adopt eco-friendly practices to address the issue of diffuse pollution from agriculture, including measures based on the provision of information on the environment. Indeed, farmers' perception of the state of the water body and their awareness of the causes and consequences of water pollution affect their willingness to adopt eco-friendly farming practices. Public policies therefore have a role to play in disseminating environmental information. In this article, we investigate how information measures may exert influence on changes in farming practices and thereby water pollution. We extend an existing agent-based model of a social-ecological system representing a drinking water catchment area. In the decision-making process based on the theory of planned behaviour we integrate a dynamical environmental component of farmers' attitude towards eco-friendly practices, in order to take into account the effect of information on the ecological system. We explore the impact of information measures, heterogeneity in farmers' environmental preferences and var-iations in the initial level of water pollution on farmers' participation to a water catchment protection pro-gramme. Our results show that: (1) targeting farmers who have higher environmental preferences is more effective than no targeting; (2) the heterogeneity in farmers' environmental preferences impacts their involve-ment in the programme depending on the average environmental preferences; (3) the higher the initial pollution, the higher the farmers are involved in the protection programme; (4) when two different measures are combined, once a certain threshold of public awareness is reached, there is a synergy between them.},

abstract={This study makes a first attempt to operationalize the safe operating space concept at a regional scale by considering the complex dynamics (e.g. non-linearity, feedbacks, and interactions) within a systems dynamic model (SD). We employ the model to explore eight `what if' scenarios based on well-known challenges (e.g. climate change) and current policy debates (e.g. subsidy withdrawal). The findings show that the social-ecological system in the Bangladesh delta may move beyond a safe operating space when a withdrawal of a 50\% subsidy for agriculture is combined with the effects of a 2 degrees C temperature increase and sea level rise. Further reductions in upstream river discharge in the Ganges would push the system towards a dangerous zone once a 3.5 degrees C temperature increase was reached. The social-ecological system in Bangladesh delta may be operated within a safe space by: 1) managing feedback (e.g. by reducing production costs) and the slow biophysical variables (e.g. temperature, rainfall) to increase the long-term resilience, 2) negotiating for transboundasy water resources, and 3) revising global policies (e.g. withdrawal of subsidy) that negatively impact at regional scales. This study demonstrates how the concepts of tipping points, limits to adaptations, and boundaries for sustainable development may be defined in real world social-ecological systems.

abstract={Research into urban commons has gained momentum in recent years. This article concentrates on the concept and analysis of urban water commons as social-ecological systems, which receive a less prominent focus in the literature than other commoning practices. In the light of the distinctive social and ecological values of water for both ecosystem health and human wellbeing and sociability, we argue that the presence of water systems can foster stakeholder engagement and leverage self-organization in urban commons. We test our hypothesis in a dynamically evolving urban water common: the recently restored Geoffrey Jellicoe's Water Gardens in Hemel Hempstead, England. We apply Ostrom's multilevel diagnostic tool, the ``Social-Ecological System framework{''}, to analyse the characteristics of the Gardens water system and their impact on the self-organizing process undertaken by the local community. Our application is supported by collection of primary and secondary data, including Jellicoe's design archived evidence, field observation data, in-depth interviews with key stakeholders, as well as data mining from social media (topic modelling of Facebook posts, review of Facebook user profiles, and Twitter mention-network analysis). Through our results, we identify a broad spectrum of characteristics of the Gardens urban water common that can catalyse the local self-organization dynamics. These include the leadership position of a specific non-governmental stakeholder group with knowledge and expertise on water ecosystems; active engagement of the local population across age groups in recreational activities on the water; community-building through expertise and knowledge-sharing on the peculiar natural and infrastructural components of the Gardens water systems; and, finally, continued online networking and social-media communication among different stakeholder groups on water-related activities.},

abstract={More frequent drought is projected for California. As water supplies constrict, and urban growth and out-migration spread to rural areas, trade-offs in water use for agriculture, biodiversity conservation, fire hazard reduction, residential development, and quality of life will be exacerbated. The California Black Rail (Laterallus jamaicensis coturniculus), state listed as ``Threatened,{''} depends on leaks from antiquated irrigation district irrigation systems for much of its remnant small wetland habitat in the north central Sierra Nevada foothills. Residents of the 1295 km(2) foothill habitat distribution of the Black Rail were surveyed about water use. Results show that the most Black Rail habitat is owned by those purchasing water to irrigate pasture, a use that commonly creates wetlands from leaks and tailwater. Promoting wildlife, agricultural production, and preventing wildfire are common resident goals that call for abundant and inexpensive water; social and economic pressures encourage reduction in water use and the repair of leaks that benefit wildlife and greenery. Broad inflexible state interventions to curtail water use are likely to create a multitude of unintended consequences, including loss of biodiversity and environmental quality, and alienation of residents as valued ecosystem services literally dry up. Adaptive and proactive policies are needed that consider the linkages in the social-ecological system, are sensitive to local conditions, prevent landscape dewatering, and recognize the beneficial use of water to support ecosystem services such as wildlife habitat. Much Black Rail habitat is anthropogenic, created at the nexus of local governance, plentiful water, agricultural practices, historical events, and changing land uses. This history should be recognized and leveraged rather than ignored in a rush to ``save{''} water by unraveling the social-ecological system that created the landscape. Policy and governance needs to identify and prioritize habitat areas to maintain during drought.},

abstract={Oases provide the most important support to human livelihood and economic activities in drylands. In recent decades, nature and humanity in oases areas have been increasingly integrated, and it is necessary to coordinate the development of the two. This study quantitatively defined the evolutionary phases of the social-ecological system based on varying correlations among agricultural, socioeconomic, and ecological factors. Three different evolutionary phases have been identified in the development of oases in northwestern China since 2000. In the first phase, the groundwater supply increased with agricultural and socioeconomic development. The subsequent phase was characterized as the groundwater supply increased with faster agricultural development. In the final phase, the groundwater supply decreased in response to urban development improvements. As social factors such as population, economic growth, urbanization, and environmental protection became more reliant on groundwater, its contribution to groundwater depletion increased from 8.37\% to 76.52\%, which further constrained grain production. The findings emphasized that groundwater allocation played a critical role in influencing the development mode of the oasis system. Achieving sustainable social-ecological development requires an integrated and systemic perspective that focuses on the tradeoff between food production, ecological security, water resource security and economic development.},

abstract={The European Alps are known as the `water towers of Europe'. However, climatic and socioeconomic changes influence both water supply and demand, increasing the need to manage this limited and valuable resource properly to avoid user conflicts and water scarcity. Two major challenges emerge when assessing water scarcity in the Alps: Firstly, mountainous regions are very heterogeneous regarding water availability and demand over space and time, and therefore water scarcity assessments need to be done at low temporal and spatial scales. Secondly, the tight coupling of the natural and the social sphere necessitate an integrative approach considering dynamics and interactions of the social-ecological system. Hence, we applied the agent-based water supply and demand model Aqua.MORE, which is designed for catchment scale and sub-daily temporal resolution, to a case study site in the Italian Alps. In the model, the water supply, the local water managers and water users are represented by interacting model agents. We estimated the water supply by refining the annual runoff data provided by the InVEST water yield model for within-year variations. Local stakeholders contributed to the development of quantitative and spatially-explicit scenarios for land use and tourism evolution. To evaluate water supply and demand dynamics, we assessed six scenarios for the period of 2015 to 2050: three different socio-economic policy pathways, both alone and in combination with a climate change scenario. In all six scenarios, the water demand:supply (D:S) ratio continuously rises from 2015 to 2050. The highest D:S ratio values are prognosed at the beginning of the irrigation period in May. In all scenarios considering climatic changes, the D:S ratio exceeds 20\% for several days, indicating potential water scarcity. The simulation results reinforce the importance of analysing water balances at a high temporal resolution and can support management processes and stakeholder dialogues for sustainable watershed management.

abstract={Globally, environmental and social change in water-scarce regions challenge the sustainability of social-ecological systems. WaterSES, a sponsored working group within the Program for Ecosystem Change and Society, explores and compares the social-ecological dynamics related to water scarcity across placed-based international research sites with contrasting local and regional water needs and governance, including research sites in Spain and Sweden in Europe, South Africa, China, and Alabama, Idaho, Oklahoma, and Texas in the USA. This paper aims to provide a commentary on insights into conducting future solutions-oriented research on water scarcity based on the understanding of the social-ecological dynamics of water scarce regions.},

abstract={Al Jabal Al Akhdar, an arid mountain region in northern Oman, has experienced rapid development over the last decades, resulting in the deterioration of water resources. This paper applies the driving force-pressure-state-impact-response (DPSIR) framework as an integrated environmental assessment tool to illustrate the cause-and-effect relationships for sustainable management of water resources in the area. The research aimed to examine social and ecological aspects of mountain water to explore optimal approaches for sustainable use and management. The water resources are affected by increasing drivers of population growth and socio-economic development, through agriculture, tourism, and urbanization, exerting pressures through overconsumption of water, coupled with the exogenous pressure of climate change. The decreased rainfall and increased water demand have resulted in the degradation of water quantity and quality. The declining state of the water resources and reduced area of cultivation have resulted in considerable losses in agricultural income. The Omani government has adopted some responses, including water development projects, acting to reduce pressures as well as to improve the state of water resources. The DPSIR analysis indicates that trade-offs should be made between economic development and the continued supply of water for the agro-ecological system; choices could be in the prioritization of drivers. A dependence on desalinated water will introduce a reliance on a non-renewable external energy supply and is unlikely to ensure water supply at the multi-century timescale of the social-ecological system. In addition, tourism is predominantly based around the disappearing agro-ecosystems which in turn are dependent on the supply of water. Therefore, efforts should be directed towards improving water-use efficiency through installing modern irrigation technology, water conservation methods, use of greywater and treated wastewater, and rainwater harvesting as well as integrated water resources management, and climate change mitigation and adaptation measures.},

pages={NA},

abstract={Stormwater management has long been a critical societal and environmental challenge for communities. An increasing number of municipalities are turning to novel approaches such as green infrastructure to develop more sustainable stormwater management systems. However, there is a need to better understand the technological decision-making processes that lead to specific outcomes within urban stormwater governance systems. We used the social-ecological system (SES) framework to build a classification system for identifying significant variables that influence urban stormwater governance decisions related to green infrastructure adoption. To adapt the framework, we relied on findings from observations at national stormwater meetings in combination with a systematic literature review on influential factors related to green infrastructure adoption. We discuss our revisions to the framework that helped us understand the decision by municipal governments to adopt green infrastructure. Remaining research needs and challenges are discussed regarding the development of an urban stormwater SES framework as a classification tool for knowledge accumulation and synthesis.},

abstract={Social-ecological system (SES) management plays an important role in terrestrial carbon dynamics and human well-being in fragile drylands. Over the past four decades, the Chinese Ecosystem Research Network has accumulated valuable experience on the infrastructure safeguarding, vegetation restoration, and watershed improvements, and has made substantial progress in biodiversity, land use, and climate change research, which could provide data and a theoretical base for an explicit and quantitative SES indicator system. Here, we introduced the key findings that could inspire scientific SES trade-off rethinking and presented a conceptual framework based on the observation platforms. Emphasis is placed on the radiative effects of the in situ-site stations involved in local social and natural surroundings, which could link-up the policy makers to enhance the balance of SES elements. It aiming to contribute to full initiatives of station researchers and to promote more productive collaboration for cross-site and interdisciplinary research in SES sustainability management.},

abstract={Research on water resource conflicts needs to be better aligned with practitioner approaches to water resources development, chiefly integrated water resources management (IWRM). This paper bridges the gap between research and practice through a novel application of the social-ecological systems framework to a set of 10 conflict cases from an IWRM initiative in rural Central America. The conflicts in the empirical cases are found to be primarily the result of socio-political variables, particularly low levels of trust and social capital, and peacebuilding is suggested as a promising approach to address this suite of conflicts. The paper concludes with a proposed course of research designed to further both theoretical and applied knowledge of water resource conflicts.},

month={DEC},
abstract={Transboundary water resources, such as international river basins, pose complex and often contentious management challenges. In response to the failures associated with the state-centric approach to the governance of international waters, discussions on transboundary water resources governance over the last two decades or so have focused largely on public involvement. The need to build resilience into such governance systems has been virtually overlooked. Based on a conceptualization of transboundary water resources as complex social-ecological systems, the manuscript proposes adaptive governance as a unifying framework for informing policies aimed at promoting the conservation of transboundary water resources in an increasingly unpredictable future. The key attributes of adaptive governance satisfy the requirements for good governance of transboundary water resources, as well as preparing the coupled social-ecological system to respond to unpredictable drivers of change.},

abstract={This paper argues for a systemic-relational (SR) approach to environmental ethics, in order to enable water resource management (WRM) to be effective and fair. This will require WRM to develop and internalise an ethically grounded approach. An SR approach holds that value with regard to the social-ecological system (SES) is to be primarily located, not at the level of its constituent components, but at the level of the SES as an integrated unit. The key principles informing the SR approach are spelled out, and its potential relevance to WRM is illustrated, using the key values operating within the WRM sector in South Africa as a case study.},

title={Implementing Integrated Catchment Management in the upper Limpopo River basin: A situational assessment},
journal={PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH},

volume={93},
number={NA},
pages={104-118},
month={JUN},
abstract={A three-phase study was initiated as a way to promote Integrated Catchment Management approaches in the Limpopo River basin. This paper presents the situational assessment, which should enable De Beers to understand how their Venetia Mine operations are located within a broader and highly dynamic socioeconomic and ecohydrological landscape as it pertains to water risks. The second phase, Risk assessment, aims to develop conservation interventions in the identified areas; the third phase will develop mechanisms for implementing water stewardship schemes to mitigate the shared water risks. Analysis of the social-ecological system (hydrological, climatic, ecological, socio-economic and governance systems) of the Limpopo River basin indicates that the institutional arrangement of the Limpopo River basin is neither simple nor effective. The basin is rapidly approaching closure in the sense that almost all of the available supplies of water have already been allocated to existing water users. If the proposed ecological flow requirements were to be met for all of the tributaries, the basin would be `closed'. On-going and projected land use changes and water resources developments in the upper reaches of the basin, coupled with projected rainfall reductions and temperature increases, and allocation of the flows for the ecological reserve, are likely to further reduce downstream river flows. The coupled increase in temperature and decrease in rainfall is of great concern for everyone in the basin, especially the poorer communities, who rely on rain-fed agriculture for their livelihoods. Increased temperatures also lead to increased evaporation from reservoirs and therefore result in a decrease in water availability. This will lead to increased abstraction of groundwater, especially from alluvial aquifers, and consequently an increase in river transmission losses and a decrease in river flows.

abstract={Global groundwater overexploitation positions groundwater governance as a critical issue for improving sustainable water management. Evidence of aquifer recovery after overexploitation is scattered, as is the research on the drivers behind recovery. The Fuencaliente Aquifer in Spain faced a tragedy of the commons situation, but after an innovative governance arrangement was implemented, the aquifer is gradually recovering. In this research, we identify the drivers that made possible the emergence and acceptance of such an arrangement using the social-ecological system framework. We identified external drivers such as market incentives and limited enforcement capacity of the water authority as the main factors that led to groundwater depletion, but we also found that these same drivers, under a new regulatory framework that reinforced monitoring and sanctioning capacities, are the basis for the effective recovery of the aquifer. Internal drivers such as the socioeconomic attributes of the users, their limited collective action and the power differences between traditional and commercial farmers are also critical in explaining the acceptance of the new governance arrangement. Even if these drivers are context-specific, we identified innovations that might be transferable and contribute to the literature on good practices in groundwater governance and management.},

abstract={This paper is a social-ecological systems (SES) analysis of tourism and water inequity in Bali. It uses Elinor Ostrom's SES model to look at the particular niche of Bali's tourism and water nexus. Re-analysis of previous qualitative research revealed that the vulnerability of the SES was due to numerous characteristics. In particular, user groups are highly diverse, transient and stratified, thereby inhibiting communication and knowledge sharing. This, in combination with weak governance systems and the economic power of the tourism industry, interact to affect declining water resources and the iniquitous impact of this. Whilst there are obvious indications that Bali's water resources are over stretched, there is no feedback loop to the institutional structures that would help enable appropriate responses from the user groups or governance system.},

volume={17},

abstract={In many densely settled agricultural watersheds, water quality is a point of conflict between amenity and agricultural activities because of the varied demands and impacts on shared water resources. Successful governance of these watersheds requires coordination among different activities. Recent research has highlighted the role that social networks between management entities can play to facilitate cross-scale interaction in watershed governance. For example, bridging organizations can be positioned in social networks to bridge local initiatives done by single municipalities across whole watersheds. To better understand the role of social networks in social-ecological system dynamics, we combine a social network analysis of the water quality management networks held by local governments with a social-ecological analysis of variation in water management and ecosystem services across the Monteregie, an agricultural landscape near Montreal, Quebec, Canada. We analyze municipal water management networks by using one-mode networks to represent direct collaboration between municipalities, and two-mode networks to capture how bridging organizations indirectly connect municipalities. We find that municipalities do not collaborate directly with one another but instead are connected via bridging organizations that span the water quality management network. We also discovered that more connected municipalities engaged in more water management activities. However, bridging organizations preferentially connected with municipalities that used more tourism related ecosystem services rather than those that used more agricultural ecosystem services. Many agricultural municipalities were relatively isolated, despite being the main producers of water quality problems. In combination, these findings suggest that further strengthening the water management network in the Monteregie will contribute to improving water quality in the region. However, such strengthening requires developing a network that better connects both agricultural and tourism oriented municipalities. Furthermore, these findings show that consideration of the social-ecological context of social networks, can help explain the structure of networks and reveal social-ecological clusters and disconnects in a network.},

month={NA},
abstract={Interdependencies of ecologic, hydrologic, and social systems challenge traditional approaches to natural resource management in semi-arid regions. As a complex social-ecological system, water demands in the Sonoran Desert from agricultural and urban users often conflicts with water needs for its ecologically-significant riparian corridors. To explore this system, we developed an agent-based model to simulate complex feedbacks between human decisions and environmental conditions in the Rio Sonora Watershed. Cognitive mapping in conjunction with stakeholder participation produced a Bayesian model of conditional probabilities of local human decision-making processes resulting to changes in water demand. Probabilities created in the Bayesian model were incorporated into the agent-based model, so that each agent had a unique probability to make a positive decision based on its perceived environment at each point in time and space. By using a Bayesian approach, uncertainty in the human decision-making process could be incorporated. The spatially-explicit agent-based model simulated changes in depth-to-groundwater by well pumping based on an agent's water demand. Changes in depth-to-groundwater feedback to influence agent behavior, as well as determine unique vegetation classes within the riparian corridor. Each vegetation class then provides varying stakeholder-defined quality values of ecosystem services. Using this modeling approach allowed us to examine effects on both the ecological and social system of semi-arid riparian corridors under various scenarios. The insight provided by the model contributes to understanding how specific interventions may alter the complex social-ecological system in the future.},

abstract={In Azraq in Eastern Jordan, farmers, domestic users, and a wetland ecosystem compete for and overexploit limited groundwater resources. Current studies explain parts of the problem, but do not take a comprehensive social-ecological systems perspective and tend to miss underlying hidden factors. To explain decision-making in this complex social-ecological system, we combine the concept of networks of action situations (NAS) with the political economy concept of the social contract. While the NAS allows a systematic exploration of the system, the concept of the social contract allows a deeper understanding of how informal institutions and power influence the system. Besides a comprehensive literature review, we draw on social network mapping and 67 semi-structured interviews with relevant stakeholders. We find that the main conflict arises between a heterogeneous group of farmers, who use groundwater for irrigation agriculture supported by a strong political lobby, and the water authorities, which rely on the aquifer for domestic water supply at national level. The original wetland with its diverse ecosystem services has largely disappeared and its remainder is maintained artificially. Our analysis reveals that a diversity of action situations, including water, agricultural, environmental, energy, and land governance, but also the monarchy's underlying social contract and the informal concept of wasta, influence outcomes on the ground. We show that no panacea exists, but that systems thinking may help identify a range of intervention points, some more sensitive than others, that could support a social-ecological transformation towards sustainability.},

title={Historical, contemporary, and future perspectives on a coupled social-ecological system in a changing world: Canada's historic Rideau Canal},

abstract={Anthropogenic waterways and canal systems have been part of the cultural and natural landscape for thousands for years. As of the late 20th century, more than 63 000 km of canals exist worldwide as transport routes for navigation, many with barriers (e.g., locks, dams) that fragment the system and decrease connectivity. Fragmentation alone can have negative implications for freshwater biodiversity; by isolating populations and communities, other human-mediated disturbances associated with canals like poor water quality and invasive species can exacerbate these negative effects. As such, the capacity of these interconnected freshwater systems to support biodiversity is continuously degrading at a global level. One critical, highly complex issue that unites canals worldwide is the challenge of governing these systems in a holistic, unified way to both protect biodiversity and preserve historical elements. Managing historic canals involves multiple objectives across many agencies and stakeholders, often with different or conflicting objectives. Here, we use the Rideau Canal, a UNESCO World Heritage Site and National Historic Site of Canada, as a case study to demonstrate the importance of considering canals as social-ecological systems for effective and efficient governance. Historic canals are integrated systems of both humans (social) and the environment (ecological), linked by mutual feedbacks and coevolution, and must be managed as such to achieve conservation goals while maintaining commemorative integrity. We discuss the history of the Rideau Canal and its current governance, biodiversity in the waterway, different threats and issues (user conflicts, aquatic pollution, shoreline development, water management, species at risk, and invasive species), and conclude by outlining ways to address the challenges of managing it as a coupled social-ecological system. We present different research needs and opportunities that would enable better management, though above all, we propose a shift from the current governance structure - which at best can be considered ``patchwork{''} - to a coordinated, multi-scalar and multi-stakeholder governance regime such that the Rideau Canal can be maintained for its historical integrity without compromising biodiversity conservation. Given that canals are now pervasive worldwide, this article is not only topical to the Rideau Canal, but also to other waterways in Canada and beyond.},

abstract={The social-ecological system of the Lake Manyara basin (Northern Tanzania), a UNESCO Biosphere reserve (BR) suffers from social-economic and environmental problems due to decreasing water levels, erosion and land and water use conflicts. We propose an integrated assessment of the social-ecological interactions of the area to support future sustainable management. Within the Drivers-Pressures-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) framework an integrated literature review and several methods of knowledge collection were combined to identify future management priorities and challenges. During focus groups with farmers and pastoralists, stakeholders confirmed the role played by land use changes as driver and pressure in the landscape, e.g. through increased erosion rates and siltation of the lake. Moreover, economic and social issues were identified as prominent factors being influenced by, or influencing these processes. These statements match the scientific literature. During participatory mapping exercises different spatial and resource allocation perceptions appeared amongst pastoralists and farmers. The multidisciplinary approach proved to be useful to acquire an integrated and comprehensive understanding of the state, challenges and opportunities of Lake Manyara BR, to feed into a decision support system in service of an integrated management plan. Our assessment suggests that improved water governance in a multi-actor approach (with a focus on distribution of benefits, rights, and a specific role of the water authorities) should be a priority for future integrated management strategies. Also, awareness raising amongst decision makers, scientists and local communities is needed to demonstrate the advantages of an integrated approach. And finally, visible and fair mechanisms to share conservation revenues should be designed in a way that local benefits can be obtained together with incentive mechanisms for co-management and conservation.},

abstract={In this study we analyse how three cities in the arid Americas have addressed urban growth while facing water scarcity: Hermosillo, Mexico; Mendoza, Argentina; and Tucson, USA. We use the urban water security framework to examine five domains of water management: sociodemographic, economic, technological, ecological and governance (SETEG). Our analysis indicates that, in spite of water scarcity, urban growth has been promoted in the three cities. We argue that this expansion, although encouraged for economic development, is not sustainable in the long term. In the three cities, groundwater plays a major role in water supply, but growth has negatively affected riparian ecosystems, the health of the aquifers and access to domestic water. In order to pursue water security, several options are essential to enhance social-ecological system resilience. These include limits or reduction of urban expansion, reuse of treated effluent for riparian conservation, and community conservation efforts such as rainwater harvesting and other green infrastructure practices.},

abstract={The objective of this paper is to identify the type of barriers related to the implementation of a new Water Law in Nicaragua. By exploring the perceptions of 40 actors involved in the drafting process of the Law, this paper finds that major barriers are related to the power configuration of the water administration set-up, which creates conflicts of competences within government and at local and national levels. Our research suggests that decision-making is highly centralized, whereas local governments remain unpowered despite their relevant role in water management. One of the particular novel aspects of this paper is the linking of interview data to grammarcoded institutional statements along the social-ecological systems' variables. The institutional grammar tool is used to identify the institutional statements of the Nicaraguan Water Law and to connect the interview results to the institutional configuration of the Water Law. This allows us to understand to what extent the Water Law modifies both the formal and informal institutions that are in place.},

abstract={A social-ecological system (SES) framework increasingly underpins the ``resilience paradigm.{''} As with all models, the SES comes with particular biases. We explore these key biases. We critically examine how the SES resilience literature has attempted to define and analyze the social arena. We argue that much SES literature defines people's interests and livelihoods as concerned primarily with the environment, and thereby underplays the role of other motivations and social institutions. We also highlight the SES resilience literature's focus on institutions and organized social units, which misses key aspects of social diversity and power. Our key premise is the importance of inter-and multi-disciplinary perspectives. To illustrate this, we draw attention to the critique of earlier ecological anthropology that remains relevant for current conceptualizations of SESs, focusing on the concepts of social diversity and power. And we discuss insights from social anthropology and political ecology that have responded to this critique to develop different ways of incorporating social diversity and power into human-environment relations. Finally, we discuss how these social science perspectives can help improve the understanding of the ``social{''} in SES resilience research.},

abstract={One environmental solution proposed by scholars since the 1980s is to manage our common natural resources adaptively with emphasis on feedback, the inclusion of multiple stakeholders and the flexibility to change accordingly. By focusing the analysis on the understudied topic of urban river systems in adaptive governance, a systematic literature review and a scenario-building exercise were conducted. Whereas the bibliometric analysis aims to improve our collective knowledge on many aspects of the adaptive management in urban stream governance, the urban commoning scenario-building exercise is to simulate alternatives beyond conventional top-down management approaches and to explore different opportunities of engaging multiple stakeholders throughout the adaptive management cycle. Our investigations recommend that although there is a trend of considering the ``human{''} or ``soft{''} perspective as part of the integrated solution approach, future researches need to ground their studies in more empirical cases in order to identify a few contextual variables such as ICT or public-private collaboration arrangement to leverage the complex inputs of soft power as benefits and added value in the management of urban river as a social-ecological system.},

journal={INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE COMMONS},

volume={10},
number={1},
pages={71-118},
month={NA},
abstract={Achieving cooperation in natural resource management is always a challenge when incentives exist for an individual to maximise her short term benefits at the cost of a group. We study a public good social dilemma in water infrastructure provision on land reform farms in Namibia. In the context of the Namibian land reform, arbitrarily mixed groups of livestock farmers have to share the operation and maintenance of water infrastructure. Typically, water is mainly used for livestock production, and livestock numbers are subject to high fluctuations due to the given environmental conditions. Our paper assesses how alternative payment systems with differing congruence of provision and appropriation support the cooperation in the group given the ever-changing equilibria. In a first step, we conducted an exploratory overview of the social-ecological system of central Namibian land reform projects. The Social Ecological System (SES) Framework served as a guideline for this assessment (Ostrom 2009). Taking the complexity of the cooperation situation into account, in the second step we designed a role-play that is based on a social-ecological simulation model. The role-play simulates the real-life decision situations of land reform beneficiaries wherein equilibria are permanently changing. This approach helped us to not only better understand the cooperation challenges of Namibian land reform beneficiaries, but also supported stakeholders in their decision making and institution building. Our study provides evidence to support that land reform beneficiaries increase their contributions as they own more livestock and as other group members increase their payments. Nevertheless, only groups with relatively homogeneous livestock endowments manage to agree on payment rules. Interestingly, the dominant rule is an ``equal payment per farmer{'' and not a ``payment per head of livestock{''}, though the latter would imply a higher congruence of provision and appropriation.},

title={Environmental flows in the Rio Grande - Rio Bravo basin},
journal={ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
year={2022},
volume={27},
number={1},
pages={NA},
month={MAR},
abstract={The Rio Grande/Bravo is an arid river basin shared by the United States and Mexico, the fifth-longest river in North America, and home to more than 10.4 million people. By crossing landscapes and political boundaries, the Rio Grande/Bravo brings together cultures, societies, ecosystems, and economies, thereby forming a complex social-ecological system. The Rio Grande/Bravo supplies water for the human activities that take place within its territory. While there have been efforts to implement environmental flows (flows necessary to sustain riparian and aquatic ecosystems and human activities), a systematic and whole-basin analysis of these efforts that conceptualizes the Rio Grande/Bravo as a single, complex social-ecological system is missing. Our objective is to address this research and policy gap and shed light on challenges, opportunities, and success stories for implementing environmental flows in the Rio Grande/Bravo. We introduce the physical characteristics of the basin and summarize the environmental flows studies already done. We also describe its water governance framework and argue it is a distributed and nested governance system across multiple political jurisdictions and spatial scales. We describe the environmental flows legal framework and argue that the authority over different aspects of environmental flows is divided across different agencies and institutions. We discuss the prioritization of agricultural use within the governance structure without significant provisions for environmental flows. We introduce success stories for implementing environmental flows that include leasing of water rights or voluntary releases for environmental flow purposes, municipal ordinances to secure water for environmental flows, nongovernmental organizations representing the environment in decision-making processes, and acquiring water rights for environmental flows, among others initiatives. We conclude that environmental flows are possible and have been implemented but their implementation has not been systematic and permanent. There is an emerging whole-basin thinking among scientists, managers, and citizens that is helping find common-ground solutions to implementing environmental flows in the Rio Grande/Bravo basin.},

abstract={In this study we hypothesize that Ostrom's social-ecological system (SES) framework can be useful to address the introduction pathways and dispersal vectors of non-native species. We have applied this framework to the introduction of the Asian clam Corbicula fluminea in freshwaters in Galicia (Spain). We reviewed scientific and grey literature and performed a series of interviews with key stakeholders. This information, coupled with an extensive survey campaign, provided an updated C. fluminea distribution map. Using a Principal Component Analysis and pair-wise correlations we analyzed a set of 18 social, ecological, economic and governance variables and related them to the total number of water bodies invaded by C. fluminea in Galicia. Our field data on C. fluminea distribution indicated a mean upstream spread of 3.6kmyr(-1). We suggest that the total number of water bodies invaded by C. fluminea in Galician freshwaters is mainly linked to the following variables of the social (higher education level and mass media news), ecological (endangered freshwater species, scientific publications, dams, wastewater treatment plants, livestock, and agricultural lands), economic (gross domestic product, gross imports, and industrial productivity index) and governance (surveillance, legislative instruments and non-governmental organizations) dimensions. The SES framework has been useful in identifying introduction pathways and dispersal vectors of non-native species. We encourage decision-makers to get involved in real implementation of legislative instruments and management plans that will be benefitted by collaborating efforts between stakeholders.},

abstract={The water policy reform in the Murray-Darling Basin (MDB) will have a range of implications on the social-ecological system (SES) of the Basin. We propose an analytical framework that may be useful in analysing how policy changes or external shocks, which originate in one part of a SES can be traced transparently throughout the SES by sequentially linking a series of models, where each model has demonstrated strength in explaining a part of the whole system. This framework is suitable to analyse the national, regional and spatial socio-economic and distributional effects of regional-specific policy reforms or external shocks.},

abstract={The management of Lake Okeechobee in Florida has undergone significant changes in the last decade. Socio-political, environmental and demographic factors have driven changes in the environmental and water policy, which in turn have led to wide-ranging institutional changes and a shift toward multiobjective planning and implementation in the Lake management. This article describes the changes in the philosophy and practice of water resources management in South Florida hydrologic system, of which Lake Okeechobee is a crucial component. The impacts of the changes on management goals and decision processes are illustrated through a case study of the use of climate information in Lake management. The article concludes with a brief examination of the implications of the institutional changes, including greater public participation, for the long-term sustainability of the social-ecological system in South Florida.},

abstract={Managing transboundary river basins requires balancing tradeoffs of sustainable water use and coping with climate uncertainty. We demonstrate an integrated approach to exploring these issues through the lens of a social-ecological system, combining remote and in-situ earth observations, hydrologic and climate models, and social surveys. Specifically, we examine how climate change and dam development could impact the Se Kong, Se San and Sre Pok rivers in the Mekong region. We find that climate change will lead to increased precipitation, necessitating a shift in dam operations, from maintaining low flows to reducing flood hazards. We also find that existing water governance systems in Laos, Vietnam, and Cambodia are ill-prepared to address the problem. We conclude that the solution space for addressing these complex issues will be highly constrained unless major deficiencies in transboundary water governance, strategic planning, financial capacity, information sharing, and law enforcement are remedied in the next decades.},

abstract={The Social-Ecological Systems framework serves as a valuable framework to explore and understand social and ecological interactions, and pathways in water governance. However, it lacks a robust understanding of change. We argue an analytical and methodological approach to engaging global changes in SES is critical to strengthening the scope and relevance of the SES framework. Relying on SES and resilience thinking, we propose an institutional and cognitive model of change where institutions and natural resources systems co-evolve. Our model of change provides a dynamic understanding of SES that stands on three causal mechanisms: institutional complexity trap, rigidity trap, and learning processes. We illustrate how data cube technology could overcome current limitations and offer reliable avenues for testing hypotheses about the dynamics of Social-Ecological Systems and water security by offering to combine spatial and time data with no major technical requirements for users.},

abstract={In the European Union (EU) context, regulatory instruments and incentive schemes targeting individual farms remain the main policy instruments implemented to control diffuse pollution from agriculture. Yet, collective approaches to policy implementation have been recently developing. This article aims at assessing the potential for hybrid policy instruments relying on collective action among farmers to limit diffuse nitrate pollution from agriculture. Transaction cost economics are used to assess the potential advantages of collective action as a complement to regulatory and incentive policy tools. The conditions under which such hybrid forms of governance may be successful are identified using the Social-Ecological System (SES) framework. A review of empirical studies documenting cases of collective action for policy implementation in the EU context serves as a basis for the identification of the factors likely to affect the potential of collective approaches for water quality management in agriculture. The analysis relies more particularly on two cases: the Environmental Cooperatives in the Netherlands and the ``Ferti-Mieux{''} operations in France. The results suggest that collective action is a relevant tool to consider for improving the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of policies targeting diffuse pollution from agriculture. In particular, relying on farmers' cooperation for policy implementation may be associated with advantages in terms of transaction costs. However, such advantages will be effective under a number of conditions related to the characteristics of the water resource, the actors involved, the governance of cooperation and the broader economic and institutional contexts.},

abstract={The resolution of issues related to sustainable development in regions and urbans is closely related to the complex systems, which lie not only in the numerous subsystems and spatial hierarchy, but also in the complex relationships between humans, socioeconomic, environmental and governance.The system dynamics (SD) model has been widely used in modeling regional and urban complex systems which involve multi-dimensional socio-economic and environmental issues. However, most simulations have focused on the state variables, such as the end-state social-economic and environmental situation, while the interaction between governance and their consequences on complex systems has been scarce. In addition, the social-ecological system (SES) framework has been endorsed worldwide because of its ability to explicitly recognize the complex interactions among socioeconomic-ecological-governance subsystems. To date, there have been few studies that combine the SES framework and complex systems models to quantitatively simulate the environmental performance of governance. In this research, we try to fill this gap by combining both to create a SDES model to quantitatively simulate the impacts of stakeholders' actions on environmental performance, and the feasibility of SDES model is verified by simulating the impacts of stakeholders' actions on water environment carrying capacity (WECC) in Liyang City, China. Moreover, we establish a cost-benefit analytical framework to identify the most cost-effective action to improve WECC based on the SDES model. Findings of this research contribute new theoretical and methodological insights into addressing environmental issues while we are facing a more complex regional and urban system and fragmented governance.},

abstract={This study aims at exploring ways of increasing adaptive capacity and reducing vulnerability of farmers in the face of water scarcity through establishing a link between social network indicators and the dimensions of adaptive capacity. For this purpose, a Social Network Analysis (SNA) model along with a Structural Equation Model was developed to investigate the effects of SNA indices on the dimensions influencing the adaptive capacity of the water users in rural areas in the west of Iran. The developed model links participation in production and knowledge exchange with ten critical dimensions identified to affect the adaptive capacities of water resources users. The results indicated that the most important subdimensions affecting adaptive capacity were governance, innovation, and awareness. Also, the positive effects of individual and whole network level of indices on the adaptive capacity indicated high coherence in the study area and the ability of people to develop social learning to improve the adaptive capacity.},

abstract={In a multi-reservoir system, ensuring adequate water availability across reservoirs while managing conflicting goals under uncertainties are critical to making the social-ecological system sustainable. The priorities of multiple user-groups and availability of the water resource may vary with time, weather and other factors. Uncertainties such as variation in precipitation bring more complexity, which intensifies the discrepancies between water supply and water demand for each user-group. To reduce such discrepancies, we should satisfice conflicting goals, considering typical uncertainties. We observed that models are incomplete and inaccurate, which challenge the use of the single optimal solution to be robust to uncertainties. So, we explore satisficing solutions that are relatively insensitive to uncertainties, by incorporating different design preferences, identifying sensitive segments and improving the design accordingly. This work is an example of exploring the solution space to enhance sustainability in multi-disciplinary systems, when goals conflict, preferences are evolving, and uncertainties add complexity.},

abstract={Three decades of economy growth and urbanization has brought China into the rim of water crisis. Transition to sustainability has gained consensus and put into practice at all administrative levels. However, due to locking mechanisms such as sunken investments, vested interests, and economic structure, such transition would not prove to be easy. Here we adopt the Multi-Level Perspective framework to analyze a county level water regime shift in Yiwu of Zhejiang province, which is representative for its economic success and severity of water problem in China. The transition is described as the interactions between water regime subsystems including society, economy, administration, infrastructure, and natural water cycling process, as well as the influence from the landscape level such as politics. Figures show that the water system is making a turnaround to the better side, while the government plays a key role in pushing and managing the transition. This study allows us to have a glimpse of the whole water regime transition currently happening in China, as well as being used for reference in other parts of the developing world, for the promoting of sustainable water resource management.

year={2021},
volume={8},

pages={NA},
month={MAY},
abstract={Reservoirs are built worldwide for a higher water supply in dry periods by storing water temporarily in wet periods. Recent socio-hydrology studies hypothesized, by creating ``supply-demand cycles{''}, that reservoirs can lead indirectly to counterintuitive dynamics such as more water scarcity and a higher economic and social vulnerability. This opinion argues that reservoirs are part of co-evolutionary processes with natural, social, and engineered elements and therefore, water scarcity need to be analyzed within socio-political interactions. Aspects such as (a) institutions; (b) governance processes; (c) social-ecological factors; (d) narratives of water scarcity; and (e) powerful economic interests are essential to understand feedback mechanisms between reservoirs and water scarcity and to hypothesize long-term phenomena such as water scarcity. Neglecting these interactions could lead to biased research agendas, misleading conclusions, and adverse effects on the transformation process toward sustainability. Given the complexity of social-ecological systems, the diversity and critical capacity of inter- and transdisciplinary work is crucial to further advance the study of unintended side effects of reservoirs or - more general - the study of socio-hydrology.

journal={ECOSYSTEM SERVICES},

volume={45},

pages={NA},
month={OCT},
abstract={Producing food to meet rising global demand requires a more thorough understanding of how farming systems can ensure food security without compromising economic, environmental, and social sustainability. This dilemma can be addressed through a social-ecological systems approach to ecosystem service assessment, which assesses the linkages between the different components of an agricultural social-ecological system - beef production in the Canadian Prairies. Using this framework, we documented the relationships between governance and management, social and ecological structures and processes, ecosystem services and human well-being for these systems. We also examined how this framework could aid in the greater integration of ecosystem services into decision-making and management practices for these systems. The framework was applied to all stages of the prairie beef production cycle, consisting of the cow-calf, backgrounding, finishing and feed production stages. The benefits, shortcomings and limitations of such an approach as well as the state of knowledge on relationships between the components of the system are discussed, and recommendations for future research directions, farm management strategies and policy are proposed. Overall, the high degree of heterogeneity in biophysical and socio-economic conditions across the prairie landscape underscores the need for more site-specific ecosystem service assessments and environmental stewardship policies that are tailored to these specific contexts.},

abstract={We propose and illustrate a multi-scale integrated analysis of societal and ecosystem metabolism (MuSIASEM) as a tool to bring nexus thinking into practice. MuSIASEM studies the relations over the structural and functional components of social-ecological systems that determine the entanglement of water, energy, and food flows in a complex metabolic pattern. MuSIASEM simultaneously considers various dimensions and multiple scales of analysis and therefore avoids the predicament of quantitative analysis based on reductionism (one dimension and one scale at the time). The different functional elements of society (the parts) are characterized using the concept of ``processor,{''} that is, a profile of expected inputs and outputs associated with the expression of a specific function. The processors of the functional elements of the social-ecological system can be either scaled-up to describe the metabolic pattern of the system as a whole, or scaled-down by considering the characteristics of its lower-level parts-i.e., the different processors associated with the structural elements required to express the specific function. An analysis of functional elements provides insight in the socio-economic factors that pose internal constraints on the development of the system. An analysis of structural elements makes it possible to study the compatibility of the system with external constraints (availability of natural resources and ecological services) in spatial terms. The usefulness of the approach is illustrated in relation to an example of the use of charcoal in a rural village of Laos.},

abstract={In a multireservoir system, ensuring adequate water availability while managing conflicting goals is critical to making the social-ecological system sustainable in the presence of considerable uncertainty. The priorities of multiple user groups and availability of the water resource vary with time, weather, and other factors. Uncertainties such as variations in precipitation can intensify the discrepancies between water supply and water demand. To reduce such discrepancies, we seek to satisfice conflicting goals, considering typical uncertainties. We observe that models are incomplete and inaccurate, which calls into question using a single point solution and suggests the need for solutions, which are robust to uncertainties. So, we explore satisficing solutions that are relatively insensitive to uncertainties, by incorporating different design preferences, identifying sensitive segments, and improving the design accordingly. In this article, we present an example of the exploration of the solution space to enhance sustainability in multidisciplinary systems, when goals conflict, preferences are evolving, and uncertainties add complexity, which can be applied in mechanical design. In this paper, we focus on the method rather than the results.},

abstract={Often, we think of cities as designed landscapes, where people manage everything from water to weeds. But we do not fully understand what happens to these extensively managed landscapes when there is an abrupt disruption in economic activity. Considering the ability of cities to support plant biodiversity and their importance as human habitat, we studied pre- and post-recession landscapes across a gradient of human influence by asking: How did vegetation change over time from before the housing bubble to after the nadir of the Great Recession? And how did vegetation vary across sites at regional versus residential scales? This investigation used long-term vegetation data to examine diversity trends and responses to a novel economic disturbance in, an urban social-ecological system. Overall, we found that plant species diversity increased through time across scales, while species composition homogenized in urban and agricultural areas. Residential yards, however, initially had high compositional heterogeneity which then increased over time. Changes in residential diversity were driven by substantial increases in the role of annual plants. This research improves our understanding of spatiotemporal vegetation dynamics in a coupled human-natural system, and specifically how urban vegetation dynamics are linked to anthropogenic influence. Ultimately, we recommend that city planners and managers consider economic trends when approaching community projects because of the interconnectedness of ecology and socioeconomics in urban landscapes.

abstract={Water quality degradation is a chronic problem which influences the resilience of a social-ecological system differently than acute disturbances, such as disease or storms. Recognizing this, we developed a tailored resilience framework that applies ecosystem service concepts to coastal social-ecological systems affected by degraded water quality. We present the framework as a mechanism for coordinating interdisciplinary research to inform long-term community planning decisions pertaining to chronic challenges in coastal systems. The resulting framework connects the ecological system to the social system via ecological production functions and ecosystem services. The social system then feeds back to the ecological system via policies and interventions to address declining water quality. We apply our resilience framework to the coastal waters and communities of Cape Cod (Barnstable County, Massachusetts, USA) which are affected by nitrogen over-enrichment. This approach allowed us to design research to improve the understanding of the effectiveness and acceptance of water quality improvement efforts and their effect on the delivery of ecosystem services. This framework is intended to be transferable to other geographical settings and more generally applied to systems exposed to chronic disturbances in order to coordinate interdisciplinary research planning and inform coastal management.},

volume={48},

pages={97-119},
month={NA},
abstract={The relationship between climate change and human displacement is an important topic of global concern. China is a special case due to a high level of government control enforcing the ecological migration of millions of people since the mid-1980s. Little research has addressed how resettled people adapt to climate impacts in ecologically vulnerable resettlement areas and what factors influence their intentions to relocate again or adapt locally. Employing a social-ecological system approach, this study builds a conceptual econometric framework which differentiates two steps that drive migration intention at the household level. The study uses this approach to examine the role of both contextual and household factors in motivating the migration intentions of resettled people in the largest environmental resettlement area of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, China, where household survey data were collected in 2012. This framework enabled an analysis, first, of how local contextual factors and household factors shape the severity of climate impacts on households and, second, how these factors interact with the experience of climate impacts to further influence a household's migration intention as a response to climate impacts. The results show that some contextual factors (such as limited use of water-saving techniques, little practice of cultivating aridity-resistant crops, and lack of government support), strong local social networks and being in receipt of low rates of financial remittances have significant associations with adverse climate impacts experienced by resettled households, and also with their anticipated further relocation to respond to these impacts.},

abstract={The Yangtze River Basin faces unprecedented challenges in harmonizing competing interests in its ecological and social systems. The central government of China, in response to the need for change in governance arrangements and cooperation, passed the Yangtze River Protection Law. It is China's first legislation at the basin scale and for a specific river basin. Ecological disturbances caused by industrial and other human activity, followed by political support for environmental protection, catalyzed the passage of this law. As the first tentative effort to regulate a complex and changing social-ecological system, it has incorporated multiple legal and institutional design principles identified in the adaptive governance and law scholarship: scaled approaches to social-ecological systems, cooperation to address geographical and sectoral fragmentation, and participatory capacity. These commonalities show that designs are fundamental to tackle geographic and sectoral fragmentation of complex systems and catalyze the emergence of adaptive water governance.},

abstract={Human activities, such as industrial, agricultural, and domestic pursuits, discharge effluents into riverine ecological systems that contains aquatic resources, such as fish, which are also used by humans. We conducted case studies in Malaysia to investigate the impacts of these human activities on water and fish resources, as well as on human well-being from an ergonomics perspective. This research shows that a green ergonomics approach can provide us with useful insights into sustainable relationships between humans and ecology in facilitating human well-being in consideration of the overall performance of the social-ecological system. Heavy metal concentrations contained in the effluents pollute river water and contaminate fish, eventually creating significant health risks and economic costs for residents, including the polluters. The study suggests a number of policy interventions to change human behavior and achieve greater collaboration between various levels of government, academia, civil society, and businesses to help establish sustainable relationships between humans and ecology in Malaysia.

abstract={Lakes in the Indian city of Bangalore face conservation challenges. In order to analyse these conservation challenges, the article uses DiGaetano and Strom's framework on urban governance to identify and analyse the different modes of lake governance which are at play within the city. Using data from semi-structured interviews and secondary research, this research argues that three modes of governance (managerial, clientelist and populist) characterize the city's lake system. Conflict amongst these modes of governance, which often act at cross-purposes to each other, may be one of the reasons why Bangalore has been unable to protect its lakes.},

abstract={Global environmental change affects the intensity and frequency of rainfall that increases the necessity for sustainable management of rainwater. It is more important for rain intensive country like Bangladesh otherwise it creates further problems like water logging, flood, soil erosion, and water borne diseases. Based on the survey of 80 rainwater harvesters in the Coastal Bangladesh in 2017, this paper evaluates whether rainwater harvesting is sustainable approach to govern rainwater or not by using social and ecological performance measures of Social Ecological System (SES) of Elinor Ostrom. This study found that rainwater harvesting does not affect environment, it is an acceptable approach in family and society, help to develop biodiversity condition, create resilience to climate change impact, improve equitable access to water, efficient use of rainwater, improve women performance regarding water supply to the family, contribute in achieving sustainable development goal, and do not overharvest of rainwater that could create environmental problem. Beyond these measures, it needs rainwater harvesting controlling mechanism like formal operation rule or policy to avoid overharvesting and ensure more sustainability in governing rainwater.},

abstract={Water utility managers play potentially important roles in current and future transitions toward more adaptive and sustainable approaches to water management. We report the results of qualitative interviews and focus groups designed to explore the perspectives of 22 water utility managers in the United States regarding pressures, challenges, and opportunities facing their organizations and communities. Overall, the study participants characterized their jobs as requiring a delicate balance between innovation and reliability, with no room for error in delivering abundant, clean water, but opportunities for creative problem-solving and forward planning. They demonstrated capacity for embracing changes that benefit the longer term future while imposing short-term costs on their own organizations. Coding of transcripts generated 17 major themes (11 problem categories and six solution categories), which overlap meaningfully with results of previous research on resilience, adaptability, and transformability of social-ecological systems. Overlapping themes include social learning and development of social capital through various forms of collaboration, communication, and citizen and stakeholder engagement, as well as capacity for innovation and sufficient authority to make decisions based on system needs without undue political interference or burdensome adherence to rigid rule structures.},

month={OCT},
abstract={Nature-Based Solutions for Integrated Water Resources Management (NbS-IWRM) involve natural, or nature-mimicking, processes used to improve water availability in quantity and quality sustainably, reduce the risks of water-related disasters, enhance adaptation to climate change and increase both biodiversity and the social-ecological system's resilience. United Nations and the European Commission promote their research as a cornerstone in the changeover to the Ecological Transition. In the Sierra Nevada range (Spain) and the Andean Cordillera, there is a paradigmatic and ancestral example of NbS-IWRM known as ``careo channels{''} and ``amunas{''}, respectively. They recharge slope aquifers in mountain areas and consist of an extensive network of channels that infiltrate the runoff water generated during the snow-thawing and rainy season into the upper parts of the slopes. The passage of water through the aquifers in the slope is used to regulate the water resources of the mountain areas and thus ensure the duration of water availability for the downstream local population and generate multiple ecosystem services. This form of water management is known as Water Sowing and Harvesting (WS\&H). As shown in this work, it is a living example of a resilience and climate change adaptation tool that can be qualified as a nature-based solution.},

title={Unravelling Stakeholder Perceptions to Enable Adaptive Water Governance in Dryland Systems},
journal={WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT},
year={2018},
volume={32},
number={10},
pages={NA},
month={AUG},
abstract={Adaptive water governance seeks to increase a social-ecological system's adaptive capacity in the face of uncertainty and change. This is especially important in non-linear dryland systems that are already exposed to water scarcity and increasing degradation. Conservation of water ecosystem services is key for increasing adaptive capacity in drylands, however, how stakeholders perceive water ecosystem services greatly affects how they are managed, as well as the potential for adaptive water governance. This paper focuses on identifying the system's potential for enabling adaptive water governance by analysing different stakeholder perceptions on water ecosystem services. It takes the Rio del Carmen watershed as a case study, offering important insights for an increasing number of water-scarce regions. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with key stakeholders in the watershed in order to unravel their perceptions and understand the governance context. We found disparities in how stakeholders perceive water ecosystem services have led to water overexploitation and several conflicts over water access. Our results indicate that stakeholder perceptions have a major influence on the system's adaptability, as they shape the acquisition of water ecosystem services. Divergent stakeholder perceptions act as an important barrier to collaboration. Generating and sharing knowledge could facilitate the development of a common vision, allowing all actors to co-create information about water ecosystem services and the system state, engaging them in a participatory process, suitable for their context, and that will better support adaptive water governance.},

abstract={The network relations of Qanat stakeholders in Iran as an ancient type of water-supply system were considered with the aim of clarifying the societal transformation through revitalizing power dynamics. The present network was highlighted by the interaction of three groups of new actors with the greatest social power: 1. those capable of developing trust and participation ties, 2. those with high control power and high mediation who link small family groups and play a role in empowering individuals, and 3. those who have high fame and are key players by leading thoughts and resolving conflicts. Meanwhile, Boolean Combination Index confirms the increase of various quantitative indicators, such as higher reciprocity and transitivity of relationships and shorter geodetic and diameter index. This study concluded that the revival of power relations in a social-ecological system can be effective in changing the social structure based on the recognition of internal social capitals.},

abstract={Global freshwater resources have faced critical water security challenges during the 21st century in the world's river basins. Shortages of water have impaired economic development by disrupting regimes of river flows, ecosystem functioning and food security. Excessive surface and groundwater withdrawals have almost reached the threshold. The current withdrawals of total water (4700 km(3)center dot y(-1)) suggest the imbalance of water use and renewal rates in the world's river basins. The water security issues are further intensified by phosphate and nitrate pollution from land use and climate change. Today, about 400 million people worldwide experience extreme shortages of water for daily use. Limited availability of water which needs to meet the basic needs of hygiene and sanitation for consumption and other uses has increased competition among users. While the society demands more water-intensive goods and services, the ecosystems are however left behind, consequently leading to increased conflicts and insecurity. Equitable water allocation for people and nature is becoming increasingly urgent. However, understanding the complex interactions between the society and nature in the world's river basins is limited. This paper aims to unravel some key strategies that enhance future water security through the advancement of science, knowledge and technologies in the world's river basins.},

abstract={Complex interactions between water, society, the economy, and the environment necessitate attention to how water issues are framed, and the limitations of a water-centric framework for analyzing or solving problems. We explore this complexity through an example of an existing complex, or wicked, policy problem-the case of agricultural wetland drainage in the Canadian Prairies. Agricultural wetland drainage expands the amount of productive agricultural land, increasing agricultural efficiency and productivity. Drainage is also one of the primary drivers of the loss of Canada's wetlands and is a hotly contentious issue between actors with divergent views and values in the Canadian Prairies. Using the nuances of drainage as an exemplar, we discuss how fragmented framings of water foster perspectives and solutions that fail to consider the full range of aspects and interactions, and contribute to the enduring conflicts that accompany drainage debates inmany regions. First, we discuss agricultural wetland drainage as practiced in the province of Saskatchewan, where significant regulatory and governance changes are in progress. Next, we discuss the challenges of policy and governance fragmentation, both specific to water and to the surrounding system. Finally, we note potential alternative framings that, while specific to prairie water governance, provide guidance for how other complex social-ecological challenges might be approached.},

month={DEC},
abstract={Freshwater ecosystem services supply and demand are important for achieving Sustainable Development Goal 6 of clean water. Urbanization has significantly impacted the supply, demand, and flow of freshwater ecosystem services due to various human activities. However, the changes in freshwater ecosystem service flow (FESF) under the influence of urbanization were still unclear. This study examines the highly urbanized Dongjiang River as an example and maps the supply-flow-demand network of freshwater services based on social-ecological network analysis. The results indicate that freshwater supply has increased by 0.21 billion m3 per year, while there is a decreasing trend of 0.17 billion m3 per year in demand. The FESF approach reveals that 42\%-60\% of imbalanced sub-watersheds rely on artificial water diversion projects to alleviate water deficits under dynamic flow conditions. Approximately 15.6\% of the region experiences water insecurity, driven by urbanizationinduced demand for water diversion. This increased demand puts stress on downstream sub-watershed water supply and elevates the risk of flow reduction in the main stream. The study highlights the need for sustainable water management strategies to ensure freshwater security in large river basins within urbanized areas worldwide and to address the challenges posed by uncertain urban expansion.},

abstract={There are growing accounts of innovative, often collaborative institutional approaches to water management that seem to respond better to new challenges in supply and water quality management. While some describe these new institutional designs as a ``third way{''}, as opposed to traditional state-centered or market-based modes, we find that the most salient features of it to characterize even those effective state or market designs. The fundamental ingredient, which is patterned relationships, is one that arises when social networks are built around the formal (state or market) institutions. The necessary plane of description is not on the dimension of structure (state, market, or otherwise) but in the nature and workings of these relational networks. We describe necessary features of these networks. We illustrate these points with a case study: the Environmental Water Account (EWA), a novel market-based program for negotiating water allocations around the San Francisco Bay-Delta (California, U.S.A.). We point out how this institution worked precisely because it was not merely a market-based program but, rather, built in features of an effective social network. In this way, we found a capacity of the EWA to adapt to the dynamic nature of water resources and needs, along with the uncertainties inherent in a complex social-ecological system.},

abstract={The river basin sustainability depends on both the coordinated development of socio-ecological systems and resilience to water resources. However, the lack of integrating them on spatial and temporal scales compromises our capacity to develop precise interventions towards sustainable river basins. We developed an approach by integrating water security and social -ecological coupling to assess the river basin sustainability. We divided it into four categories including highly sustainable (secure and coordinated), insecure, uncoordinated, and low sustainable (insecure and uncoordinated). The middle reach of Heihe River (MHR) was taken as the study area with the sub -basin as the spatial analysis unit from 2000 to 2020. The results showed that there was heterogeneity and agglomeration in spatial distribution. 23.8 \%, 38.8 \%, and 11\% of the sub -basins mainly clustered in the north and central areas were found in the state of water insecure and SES uncoordinated, or both respectively. The unsustainable areas (five sub -basins) and lose -lose areas (two sub -basins) should be the priority areas for management interventions. Our approach can provide an important reference for assessing and improving the river basin sustainability.},

abstract={Water management in mountainous regions faces significant challenges due to deep uncertainties arising from data scarcity, knowledge gaps, and the complex interplay of climate and socio-economic changes. While existing approaches focused on uncertainty reduction and water system optimization contribute to managing uncertainties, they often require probability distributions that can be difficult to obtain in data-scarce mountain regions. To address these challenges, we demonstrate the effectiveness of Exploratory Modeling and Analysis (EMA) in assessing water management strategies and identifying operational ranges that avoid future water scarcity. Through a case study in the complex and data-scarce Peruvian Andes, we employed EMA to run 12,000 simulations by 2050, incorporating deep uncertainties from climate and socio-economic scenarios, and hydrological modeling parameters. This analysis identified specific policy combinations demonstrating greater robustness across diverse scenarios and uncertainties. EMA explicitly identifies operational ranges of policies to avoid water scarcity but also highlights the conditions that might trigger policy failure. We also delve into the roles of the different factors used in EMA and their significance in water management applications. Our research illustrates that an exploratory hydrological modeling approach based on robust decision-making can foster a more informed decision-making process for long-term water adaptation in rapidly changing mountain regions under data scarcity and deep uncertainties.},

abstract={Blue water (irrigation water) and green water (soil moisture), as natural bases in crop production, are vulnerable to natural and socioeconomic disturbances. However, quantitative resilience assessments of blue and green water for crop production are still lacking. Here we constructed a social-ecological based general water resilience assessment framework that distinguishes blue and green water for crop production in four dimensions, including resistance, absorptive capacity, adaptive capacity and transformative capacity. The framework was applied to quantify the spatiotemporal characteristics of water resource resilience for three staple crops (rice, wheat, and maize) at provincial level in mainland China over 2000-2017. Results indicate that water resilience related to crop production of China as a whole was at the lower-middle level over the study period. The green water resilience had higher initial performance, while the blue water resilience had a faster growth rate (>50\%). The performance of adaptive and transformative capacity was 8.9 similar to 153.7\% better than resistance and absorptive capacity. There were significant heterogeneities in the water resilience score among crops and in time and space. Wheat had the highest resilience of green water, while its blue water resilience was the lowest among the three crops. The water resilience for crop production varied by up to 2.4-fold across provinces. Synergies and trade-offs among the four dimensions of water resilience were further evaluated. The current study provides an effective approach for assessing the state and progress of resilience of regional water resources for crop production.},

title={Farmers' Perception of Water Quality and Risks in the Mashavera River Basin, Georgia: Analyzing the Vulnerability of the Social-Ecological System through Community Perceptions},
journal={SUSTAINABILITY},
year={2018},
volume={10},
number={9},
pages={NA},
month={SEP},
abstract={Competing natural resources usage that leads to dramatic land use changes can threaten the balance of a social-ecological system. When this is the case, communities are directly exposed to the negative consequences of those land use changes. The Mashavera River Basin is considered one of the hotspots of environmental pollution in Georgia. This is of importance for public health because the food production from this basin meets a substantial proportion of the country's food demand. The farmers' perception of the water quality and their perceived risks to the economy, health, and lifestyle reflect the status of the environmental and social conditions. The inclusion of farmers' risk perceptions is an important stage of water quality governance that could enable active civic participation. The approach of this research study was the convergence model in the triangular design of the mixed method approach. As part of the social data, the research study was conducted with a survey of 177 households, for which agriculture was either a main or partial source of income. A few focus group discussions were also conducted. A binary logistic regression analysis was employed as the main method for the analysis. The results from the pollution load index (PLI) were used as the supportive data to verify some geospatial hypotheses. We found that aesthetic attributes (i.e., color changes observed in the river) and the source of the water contamination (i.e., mining sites) were the main predictor variables for a perceived risk to water quality, health, and livelihoods. The people who work in agriculture as the main income source had more concern about their ability to sell their agricultural products as a result of water contamination in the river, compared with people for whom agriculture is a secondary source of income or for self-consumption. Age, amount of land, years of agricultural experience, and the source of water supply for agriculture did not have a significant effect on any of the risk perception or water quality perception models. The results indicate that the health risk is perceived more strongly in areas with more heavily contaminated water compared to less polluted areas. We propose that conducting a public risk perception assessment is an ideal means to detect people's concerns regarding water quality governance for future risk analysis in Georgia. Another recommendation of this study is an integrated model of risk assessment that combines the results from a public risk perception assessment and a technical assessment. The benefits of such an integrated assessment include finding new hazard-sensitive areas for further analysis, the possibility to cross-check data for verification, communal communication of hazardous conditions by utilizing local knowledge, and the direct participation of the community in monitoring risks.},

abstract={Ecosystem services (ES) are the direct and indirect benefits people obtain from ecosystems, serving as a bridge linking ecological systems and social-economic systems. The quantitative assessment of the dynamic changes in ES and their relationships and the identification of the driving forces behind them have recently become a research hotspot. However, several research gaps remain challenging, such as the lack of an analytical framework for selecting relevant driving factors and the need for an innovative approach that integrally estimates the impacts of driving factors on the changes in ES and the relationships between ES. In this study, we modify the social-ecological system framework as the analytical basis and suggest a series of principles for selecting relevant driving factors, we then adopt the path analysis model to simultaneously and consistently quantify the contributions of driving factors to ES changes and their relationships. Using the West Liao River Basin (WLRB) as a case study, the results show the spatial-temporal variations in three ES and six driving factors from 2000 to 2020, divided into four periods. The estimation of path analysis model confirm two hypotheses that different driving factors exerted differential effects on changes in multiple ES in four periods for the whole WLRB and in three subbasins for the period 2015-2020. In addition, the path analysis exhibits the quantitative relationships between food production, water yield, and soil conservation, which vary temporally and spatially in different periods and different sub-basins. The identification of driving factors is helpful for supporting policy-making to construct a coupled self-adjusted social-ecological for the benefit of the public.},

month={SEP},
abstract={Sandy beaches are ecosystems that hold great economic value at local, national, and international level. How-ever, their perception as social-ecological systems is often limited by users and managers to the recreational asset, and their perception of ``beauty{''}. Such a perception bias can hamper conservation management, negatively impact the biodiversity on sandy beaches and even threaten the ecosystem services they provide. To survey this perception bias, we applied the method of netnography to analyse Instagram posts with the hashtag \#sandy -beach, extracting perceptions and values for nature (intrinsic, instrumental, and relational) towards sandy beaches and their ecological features. We used the concept of littoral active zone (LAZ) to define the boundaries of this social-ecological system that spans the land and the sea. Our results show that Instagram users focus on their social media mainly on the recreational values of sandy beaches and prioritise ecological features fitting into an imaginary of a ``pristine{''} beach, characterised by white sand and clear water - therewith supporting the hypothesis about a perception bias on sandy beaches. We identified a diverse set of relational values, especially around recreation and aesthetics, with a very marginal number of posts mentioning intrinsic or instrumental values. A recurring activity on LAZ was surfing, which emphasises the LAZ (wave break point, surf zone). To conserve the biodiversity and ecosystem services of sandy beaches, we see it as necessary to move away from a biased and narrow perception to one that, based on the LAZ as a system, is capable of including a diversity of biogeographical and ecological features, and the natural processes that maintain them.},

abstract={As the bulk of the world's population becomes urban, maintaining urban ecosystem services for environmental and social well-being in cities is crucial. According to resilience theory, maintaining such services requires for a complex adaptive systems perspective that helps in identifying key elements and dynamics behind cross-scale social-ecological interactions. In this context, the objective of this article is to use a resilience ``lens{''} to problematize the imminent loss of an urban wetland using the adaptive cycle model as a heuristic tool. Our case study focuses on the Xochimilco wetland, located in the southern periphery of Mexico City. Xochimilco is characterized by the presence of a complex system of raised bed wetland agriculture (the chinampa system), which was established over 1000 years ago; currently, despite having a recognized cultural and environmental value, it is threatened by increasing urban sprawl, over-exploitation of the aquifer, and water contamination. By conducting a historical analysis of the Xochimilco social-ecological system, we assess how it has gone through phases of the adaptive cycle. As a result, we identify critical elements of the system's historically maintained resilience and main drivers of system change. From such findings, we present some insights on the possibilities of maintaining the system's resilience and guidance for future management strategies for the Xochimilco wetland. Lastly, we reflect on the scope and limitations of using a resilience-based approach and an adaptive cycle analysis for addressing urban sustainability problems, especially in cities in the Global South.},

title={Groundwater as a social-ecological system: A framework for managing groundwater in Pacific Small Island Developing States},
journal={GROUNDWATER FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT},
year={2019},
volume={8},
number={NA},
pages={579-589},
month={APR},
abstract={Groundwater in Pacific Small Island Developing States is a critical source of freshwater for island ecosystems and human communities. Groundwater systems face challenges from growing populations, climate change and climate variability. Many groundwater systems in the region have been inappropriately managed, with increasing occurrences of groundwater pollution and saltwater intrusion. This limits the availability of freshwater, increases the likelihood of contracting water borne diseases, and the cost of access to alternative freshwater sources. In this paper, we argue that groundwater systems are social-ecological systems, where anthropogenic activities and groundwater conditions are linked through dynamic, non-linear processes. We also argue that groundwater management failures in the region, are associated with traditional command and control approaches to management, which ignore the systemic nature of coupled social and ecological groundwater systems; and assumes that groundwater resources, and the dependant human communities can be managed independently. Recognising the linkages and feedbacks between groundwater and dependant social communities is important for the long-term sustainability of groundwater in these regions. Conceptual frameworks are useful tools to order phenomena and material, revealing patterns and processes, and enabling the joining of multiple areas of understanding into a single conceptual-empirical structure. We propose a framework to manage groundwater as a social-ecological system. The framework is comprised of three building blocks: complex adaptive systems, resilience thinking and strategic adaptive management. We discuss how the application of the framework in the Republic of Nauru may alter decades of groundwater mismanagement and steer the resource towards a sustainable path.},

abstract={This article presents a social-ecological resilience assessment and attempts to explicitly examine the impacts of urbanization on resilience, with a view to explore how to strengthen social-ecological governance of the resilience of urban ecosystems. We use a combined Grey-Fuzzy evaluation model to discuss a case study of the Su-Xi-Chang city cluster, a metropolitan area in East China, in which total social-ecological resilience scores generally exhibited an upward trend, from 0.548 in 2001 to 0.760 in 2013. In the same period, resilience increased in relation to deterioration of environmental quality, pollution discharge, and landscape and ecological governance change, but decreased in relation to social-economic development. Besides, different contributions of indicators to their related resilience values reveal the heterogeneity of the resilience in terms of various disturbances. In addition, several scenarios are posited in an attempt to detect the relationship between social-ecological resilience and urbanization with the goal of improving urban governance. The results suggested that rapid urbanization under rigid and vertically organized forms of governance would cause the social-ecological system to lose resilience, or even to bring it near collapse. When the growth rate of urban land expansion reaches 16\%, disturbances caused by urbanization would push the social-ecological system over a particular threshold, where the way it functions changes. However, it is found that adaptive and collaborative governance, incorporating increases in both public participation and the efficiency of environment administration, would strengthen social-ecological governance of resilience to provide the urban system with a wide operating space, and even with accelerated urbanization ratios.},

They provide a majority of global ecosystem goods and services and are central to socio-cultural and economic development. Demographic pressure on coastal lands and sea resources is increasing and so are pressures attributable to global change and globalization. Managing coastal systems needs a joined-up holistic system understanding and acknowledging the multiple spatial, temporal, and institutional scales involved. Ultimately, it is all about managing people along a water continuum that may reach from far upstream down to continental shelf margins. We provide an overview of this volume featuring outstanding cases of coastal management and regions up to continental scale showing rapid coastal change as well as some insight into new scientific concepts to inform sustainable development in coasts.},

abstract={In the era of the Anthropocene, understanding the dynamic interactions between humans and water is crucial for supporting both human well-being and the sustainable management of resources. The current water management challenges are inherently unpredictable and difficult to control. Social-ecological systems (SESs) approaches explicitly recognize the connections and feedbacks between human and natural systems. For addressing the complex challenges of the Anthropocene, consideration of SES attributes such as causality (or interdependence), feedback, non-linearity, heterogeneity, and cross-scale dynamics is important. In addition, innovative qualitative and quantitative methods such as Bayesian networks, agent-based modelling, system dynamics, network analysis, multicriteria analysis, integrated assessment and role-play games have recently been used in SES research. The overall goal of this review is to gauge the extent to which SES attributes and methods are considered within the current interdisciplinary water paradigm. The paper therefore develops the normative theoretical characteristics of SES in terms of its key attributes (i.e. causality, feedback, heterogeneity, nonlinearity, and cross-scale dynamics) incorporated in the water paradigm approaches. The paper then compares the methods applied in the interdisciplinary water paradigm and examines how they can complement each other.

abstract={Community-based financing of rural water supply operation and maintenance is a well-established policy principle in sub-Saharan Africa. Yet evidence from over 90,000 waterpoints in five sub-Saharan African countries suggests a majority of communities fail to establish and sustain a revenue collection system. As a result, insufficient finances to repair waterpoints can lead to lengthy downtimes or abandonment, threatening the health and welfare of millions of water users forced to revert to unsafe or distant alternatives. Applying a social-ecological systems framework to community waterpoints in rural Kenya, we empirically assess the prevalence and determinants of financial contributions among water users. The analysis draws on multi-decadal data covering 229 years' worth of water committee financial records consisting of more than 53,000 household payments. Results reveal that non-payment and late payment are prevalent, and payment behaviours are predicted by groundwater quality, waterpoint location, productive water use, and rainfall season. The findings reflect the socio-ecological nature of waterpoint sustainability in rural sub-Saharan Africa and confirm that households are not always willing and able to pay for an improved water supply. This situation is symptomatic of a fundamental operation and maintenance financing challenge that must be addressed if the Sustainable Development Goal of universal access to safe water is to be achieved.

journal={ENVIRONMENTAL DEVELOPMENT},
year={2021},
volume={38},

pages={NA},
month={JUN},
abstract={Achieving water security for humans and ecosystems is a pervasive challenge globally. Extensive areas of the Americas are at significant risk of water insecurity, resulting from global-change processes coupled with regional and local impacts. Drought, flooding, and water quality challenges pose significant threats, while at the same time, rapid urban expansion, competing water demands, river modifications, and expanding global markets for water-intensive agricultural products drive water insecurity. This paper takes a social-ecological systems perspective, aiming to identify examples and pathways towards resilient ecosystems and social development. It draws on lessons from two science-policy network projects, one focusing on water scarcity in arid and semi-arid regions of Argentina, Chile, Brazil, Peru, Mexico and the United States; and the second addressing river and lake basins as sentinels of climate variability and human effects on water quantity and quality in Canada, the United States, Argentina, Colombia, Uruguay and Chile. Together, these `complementary contrasts' provide an analytical basis to empirically examine stakeholder engagement, knowledge co-production and science-policy interaction supporting decision-making to achieve water security. The paper identifies four tenets for decision-making based on water-security-focused global-change science in the Americas: 1) Decision makers should focus on protecting ecosystems because water security (along with food and energy security) depend on them; 2) Water-use and allocation decisions ought to be made considering future environmental and societal vulnerabilities, especially climate projections; 3) Holistic approaches (at basin or other appropriate levels) are best suited to ensure social-ecological system resilience and reduce vulnerability; and 4) It is essential to support local/traditional livelihoods, and underserved populations to achieve equitable water security and ecosystem resilience.},

abstract={In this study, we examined the extent to which global warming management is currently integrated into the European Water Framework Directive (WFD), the central legal framework for water management in the EU. We focused on the Elbe River Basin District and how global warming is addressed in its water management. We used the social-ecological systems (SES) approach as our theoretical framework, representing an eminent analytical frame of biosphere-based sustainability science. In our study, we analysed core characteristics of SES in the context of global warming to evaluate the effectiveness of current water management in the Elbe River basin concerning long-term changing climate conditions. To determine to what extent each SES feature is considered in the Elbe water management, we applied a scale of 1 to 5. Our results show that the SES feature ``scale and openness{''} is best addressed (score 4.0) by the Elbe River basin management, followed by ``context dependency{'' (score 3.9); however, ``non-linearity, uncertainty, unpredictability{'' (score 3.2), ``self-organisation and adaptability{''} (score 3.1), and ``dynamics{''} (score 3.0) have only moderate impacts. SES features can only be considered comprehensively if global warming is accounted for in an integrated way at a European level. In order to ensure effective implementation, explicit regulations and legally binding obligations are most likely required.},

abstract={In arid environments, water is a highly unpredictable natural resource. Land use must be adapted to the availability of water for plant growth and as drinking water. In the oases along the river Draa, the variability of available water is partly buffered by natural storage and by human management. The vast areas outside the oases are used as rangelands. Here, water resources can only be managed indirectly, through the management of the vegetation and natural resources, firewood and forage. To understand the effects of direct and indirect water resource management on the social-ecological system's functioning, local land use strategies must be analyzed. In the past, research has concentrated on the management of water resource scarcity because this is an obvious problem of natural resource management in arid regions. In this section, we apply a broadened approach and analyze the relevant factors on an annual and inter-annual scale. We identify key traits of pastoral land management in the High Atlas region that mitigate the negative effects of extreme weather events (droughts and floods) and slow down land degradation. Our results show that local land use mitigates drought effects through a preventive natural resource management, particularly in times of abundant rainfall; it maintains or increases the capacity of the rangeland vegetation to buffer against rainfall variability.},

volume={77},

month={AUG},
abstract={Coal mining has consumed a large amount of water resources in China, and the entire industrial chain of coal production has a larger consumption of water resources than the past especially in Shendong mining area. The water resources carrying capacity determines the scale of coal industry development. The previous research had been conducted at the national, provincial and municipal levels, but there were few studies on the water resources carrying capacity of coal mining areas. The Shendong mining area is located in the coal-rich and waterscarce western region, where precipitation is low and evaporation is high. As a water-scarce area, the development of Shendong mining area is inseparable from the support of coal resources and the rational use of water resources. Therefore, firstly, taking the Shendong mining area as the research object, this paper set high, medium and low scenarios according to the development goals of Shendong mining area, Shenhua Group and the plans of China. The gray forecast model was used to predict the water demand of the economic-social-ecological system of the mining area from 2020 to 2030 under different scenarios. Secondly, a multi-objective optimization model was established with the objective function to optimize the water resources allocation in Shendong mining area. Thirdly, based on the forecast and optimization results, a water resources carrying capacity evaluation model was constructed to evaluate the water resources carrying capacity of the Shendong mining area. Finally, based on the results, the suggestions for rational development and the utilization of water resources in the Shendong mining area were proposed.},

abstract={Problem, research strategy, and findings: States need guidance to adopt comprehensive water planning legislation that can affect urban planning and built form. Current state legislation, however, may not yet incorporate emerging water resource paradigms that promote sustainable water management at the state and substate levels. Planners can improve existing state legislation, but need guidance on incorporating the latest thinking on resilience, adaptive capacity, and sustainable commons management. I identify the 26 states with comprehensive water planning legislation, and analyze that legislation using a new assessment tool that builds on the coercive versus cooperative metric (CvCA). I determine where each state's water planning legislation falls on a coercive versus cooperative spectrum, and the extent to which each state's legislation incorporates sustainable commons management (SCM) and social-ecological resilience (SER) mechanisms and attributes. Most of the 26 states with comprehensive water planning legislation balance coercive and cooperative approaches to achieve state and substate water plans, although research suggests that planning is most effective when legislation is more cooperative. Moreover, most have not codified SCM and SER mechanisms into state water planning legislation, suggesting that the plans that follow may lack the adaptive capacity to increase the resilience of the water system. Research limitations include the single data source and potential interpretive coding bias.Takeaway for practice: Planners can advocate for new or improved state water legislation that incorporates integral adaptive and resiliency concepts, encouraging states to include the fundamental features of the social-ecological system that lead to better water management.},

abstract={In groundwater management as a common pool, the participation of the beneficiaries faces the problem of free riding. Therefore, it is necessary to provide a framework that can minimize the water public tragedy and free riding. This article used studies from around the world to develop a governance framework for the socio-ecological and resilience system and express the function of element resilience within this system in protecting groundwater public and private rights. The elements of water management were divided into the three subsystems of the aquifer, the natural environment, and the community above the aquifer, and explained how the elements sustain water services through interacting with each other. Also determined how resilience characteristics of elements against control variables groundwater, challenge public and private rights and cause controversy. The discussions showed that the elements and resilience of the elements can be different and contradictory to each other and challenge the public and private rights of groundwater, which can be very effective in building trust and stakeholder participation in water management. The SES framework is used in planning and policy-making and determining public and private rights, strengthening the resilience of the system, and assessing the dynamics of the groundwater system.},

abstract={Quantification of empirical relationships between ecosystem health and human well-being is uncommon at broad spatial scales. We used public data for Virginia (USA) counties to examine pairwise correlations among two indicators of stream health, thirteen indicators of human well-being, and four demographic metrics. Our indicators of stream health included the Virginia Stream Condition Index (VSCI) and the percentage of stream kilometers with a fish consumption advisory (\%FCA); these measures are inversely related. VSCI and \%FCA were correlated with some indicators of human health, safety and security, and living standards, as well as with some demographic metrics. VSCI was most strongly correlated (positively) with the percentage of a county's population self-identifying as White; \%FCA was most strongly correlated (positively) with overall mortality rate (number of deaths per 100,000 people). This exploratory study highlights the need for future multidisciplinary, multiscale studies to characterize toxicological, epidemiological, socioeconomic, and political linkages including causal mechanisms - between ecosystem health and human well-being.},

abstract={The land is a vital resource to support economic growth. Previous studies have mainly taken urban and agri-cultural areas as the major factors of economic boost. However, the supporting role of diversified land in sus-tainable economy has not been fully valued. This study analyzed the relationship between land cover diversity and socioeconomic outputs from 1992 to 2019 on up to 2086 counties in China. The results showed the regional disparity in the eastern and western counties. In the western counties, land cover diversity was positively correlated with per area socioeconomic indicators throughout the period. In the eastern counties, the correlation with per area indicators has gradually changed from negative to positive. The correlation with per capita in-dicators was more significant in the east than west. The regional disparity and temporal trends may come from the influence of water resources, demographic pressure and other constraints in different regions. The refreshed land value can help to achieve sustainable development and improve human well-being in the long term.},

abstract={Row crop production in the United States (US) Midwest is responsible for a myriad of water pollution issues in the Mississippi River Basin and the Gulf of Mexico. US federal and state governments have spent billions of dollars since the 1930's to understand and develop biological and geophysical practices that will reduce the negative impacts of agriculture on these landscapes and water bodies. However, significantly fewer resources have been applied to understanding the human factor within this social-ecological system. Recently the social psychological framework known as farmer identity as been used to better understand how farmers view themselves as they perform their role as farmer. To empirically test this concept in the US state of Iowa, a farmer identity question was developed and data were collected as part of an annual survey of Iowa farmers. Four farmer identities (Productivist, Conservationist, Civic-minded, and Naturalist) are identified using principal components analysis and tested for their ability to predict support for farm policy scenarios related to soil and water resource protection. Results show that Productivist, Conservationist, and Naturalist identities were likely to be activated by soil and water policies; and the Civic-minded identity was not activated by soil and water policies in general but was significantly against more money for conservation because it might mean more regulation.

pages={332-344},
month={NOV},
abstract={This article proposes a conceptual framework for understanding the resilience of water security at the scale of a river basin, thereby contributing to the ongoing scholarship on water security. Based on literature review, we apply systems thinking and resilience theories to encapsulate water security in a river basin as a system whose behaviour depends on the interaction of the component parts and the environment within which it occurs. The proposed framework has been built on the tenet that the resilience of any system such as that for water security depends on the interactions (the relationships) of the components of the particular system. We have thus argued that there is a relationship between resilience and the configurations of the system of water security. By exploring the Orange-Senqu River Basin, we suggest that configurations of the system of water security that includes the interaction of actors within the river basin, the structure of institutions (including institutional regimes), governance mechanisms, the capacity of actors and so forth generate the changes in the behaviour of the system. This behaviour might enable the system of water security to move into a different regime. Depending on the nature of the regime, the system can be considered to be resilient or nonresilient to disturbances. Any attempt to better understand this system requires us to uncover the configurations of this system and how its parts interact with each other, and this is, therefore, the pathway to unlocking the potential of achieving water security at the scale of a river basin.},

year={2024},
volume={32},

pages={33-57},
month={FEB},
abstract={Wetland protected areas (WPA) are among the most productive natural environments, providing substantial socio-economic benefits to humans as well as habitats for numerous species. However, they are also highly vulnerable in the Anthropocene era due to various factors, such as population growth, unsustainable production, and climate change. Assessing the land cover change of WPA and its driving forces is necessary work for the sustainable development and management of WPA. Here, we investigated vegetation as an indicator for land cover changes in WPA because of its strong interaction with the governance system and external related ecosystems of WPA, such as water resources and nutrient cycles. Along with the change in vegetation, we examined how climate change contributes to WPA change and human management. With the complexity of the research tasks, a social-ecological system (SES) approach was applied with three main elements: the resource system (vegetation covers), external related ecosystems (climate change), and governance system (wetland management) and their interactions through ecological performance (outcome). We contribute to the lack of temporary SES research in the coverage of External Related Ecosystems in relation to Resource systems and Governance systems. The selected site is the first Ramsar site of Vietnam's Mekong Delta-Tram Chim National Park (TCNP), which is located at the exit of the Mekong River flowing into Vietnam's territory. The study used a mixed methodology with the Mann-Kendall rank test, Theil-Sen estimative method, and the Mann-Whitney-Pettit method to analyze trends in climate parameters from 1978 to 2019. Additionally, the wetland vegetation changes were detected through the analysis of satellite images based on the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from 2002 to 2020. We also used Public Participation Geographic Information Systems (PPGIS) and carried out a desk review of local reports and previous research for the local disaster timeline and governance system. The results show that the climate in TCNP has significantly changed, with an increase in both temperature and rainfall during the dry season. However, a decrease in NDVI dynamics and an extension of the lowland vegetation community dominate the trends of spatio-temporal change in vegetation. With the SES approach, we indicated that climate change is not the main driver but is always perceived as an increased risk for biodiversity conservation of WPA. Consequently, maladaptive actions and regulations from the governance system have been implemented, which can threaten the sustainable development of WPA. Therefore, this study contributes to a more comprehensive viewpoint on the conservation and adaptive management of WPA.},

abstract={On the basis of the results of the ELVULMED, MOUVE, and CLIMED research projects, this chapter presents a long-term analysis of the Bedouin society in the northwestern coastal zone (NWCZ) of Egypt, especially the resilience of the Bedouin social-ecological system facing global change. Located along the Mediterranean coast, the NWCZ is bordered by Libya to west, the hinterland of the Nile Valley to the east, and the northeastern Sahara to the south. Settled by Bedouin tribes, the NWCZ is a typical case study of the North African pastoral area. Global change in this arid region is characterized by frequent droughts and water scarcity, structural deficit in food security, strong demographic growth, rural exodus, new social demands, especially from the youth, and serious social challenges currently linked to the Arab Spring. The first part of this chapter presents some elements relevant to the history of the NWCZ, from the Roman period until the beginning of the twentieth century, to give a better understanding of the context of the establishment of the Bedouin society. Many of these elements are not specific to the NWCZ, and they concern the entire North African and western Asian region. The second part describes the major events that have occurred during the twentieth century in the NWCZ, with the objectives to better define the main phases of the Bedouin social-ecological system and to understand the drivers of long-term change and, consequently, define possible key factors for sustainable development in the face of the new context of global change, including rangeland recuperation and management. The third part considers the Bedouin strategies in the face of global change, especially the 15-year drought from 1995 to 2010, and the changes in the socioeconomic context linked to the building of infrastructures for water supply, tourism development, information and communication technologies, the new demands of the local society, mainly the youth, and more recently the Arab Spring. Maybe the main change is the weak role of the rangeland in the new Bedouin society. In the fourth part, three scenarios for the future are described and which have been drafted with the perceptions of different local stakeholders. The fifth and final part presents some concluding remarks, focused specifically on the future of the rangeland, its management, and the role of the Bedouin society, and more generally the future of the pastoral society in the new North African changing context. The results presented in this chapter come from data collected during three successive research projects conducted from 2011 to 2013. The first project was a survey based on a large questionnaire completed by 180 breeders in six villages in the NWCZ. The questionnaire included data about the history and structure of the family, the tribe, the land, the crop and livestock farming system, the family and local networks, the perception of change, and the family's projects for the future, etc. The second project was a more detailed survey, based on the same questionnaire with 50 families in the Nagamish wadi located in the central part of the NWCZ, near the city of Marsa Matruh. This project used several tools from diverse disciplines, including crop and livestock farming systems, geography, economics, water management, and policy science. The third project involved a set of interviews with 25 local stakeholders in the NWCZ focusing on the following topics: their mental models about livestock, their perceptions regarding diverse topics such as regional trends, the main drivers of change, past, current, and future functions of livestock on a local scale, their hopes and fears for the local society, current challenges and conflicts, especially those linked to drought, water supply, and rangeland management, and their scenarios for the future.},

abstract={The Bear River is driven by a highly variable, snow-driven montane ecosystem and flows through a drought-prone arid region of the western United States. It traverses three states, is diverted to store water in an ecologically unique natural lake, Bear Lake, and empties into the Great Salt Lake at the Bear River Migratory Bird Refuge (BRMBR). People in the Bear River Basin have come to anticipate droughts, building a legal, institutional, and engineered infrastructure to adapt to the watershed's hydrologic realities and historical legacies. Their ways of understanding linked vulnerabilities has led to what might appear as paradoxical outcomes: farmers with the most legally secure water rights are the most vulnerable to severe drought; managers at the federal Bear River Migratory Bird Refuge engage in wetland farming and make unlikely political alliances; and, increased agricultural irrigation efficiency in the Bear River Basin actually threatens the water supply of some wetlands. The rationality of locality is the key to understanding how people in the Bear River Basin have increased their adaptive capacity to droughts by recognizing their interdependencies. As the effects of climate change unfold, understanding social-ecological system linkages will be important for guiding future adaptations and enhancing resilience in ways that appropriately integrate localized ecosystem capacity and human needs.},

title={Interactions between Climate Change and Infrastructure Projects in Changing Water Resources: An Ethnobiological Perspective from the Daasanach, Kenya},

pages={331-348},

abstract={The fast and widespread environmental changes that have intensified in the last decades are bringing disproportionate impacts to Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities. Changes that affect water resources are particularly relevant for subsistence-based peoples, many of whom already suffer from constraints regarding reliable access to safe water. Particularly in areas where water is scarce, climate change is expected to amplify existing stresses in water availability, which are also exacerbated by multiple socioeconomic drivers. In this paper, we look into the local perceptions of environmental change expressed by the Daasanach people of northern Kenya, where the impacts of climate change overlap with those brought by large infrastructure projects recently established in the Omo River. We show that the Daasanach have rich and detailed understanding of changes in their environment, especially in relation to water resources. Daasanach understand observations of change in different elements of the social-ecological system as an outcome of complex interactions between climatic and non-climatic drivers of change. Our findings highlight the perceived synergistic effects of climate change and infrastructure projects in water resources, driving multiple and cascading impacts on biophysical elements and local livelihoods. Our results also demonstrate the potential of Local Ecological Knowledge in enhancing the understanding of complex social-ecological issues, such as the impacts of environmental change in local communities. To minimize and mitigate the social-ecological impacts of development projects, it is essential to consider potential synergies between climatic and socioeconomic factors and to ensure inclusive governance rooted in local understandings of environmental change.},

title={Archetypical opportunities for water governance adaptation to climate change},
journal={ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
year={2020},
volume={25},
number={4},
pages={NA},
month={DEC},
abstract={We explore opportunities for climate adaptation in the context of water governance. We focus on opportunities linked to the provision of climate information, raising the question of whether they are limited to incremental adaptation, or can also bring about transformational adaptation. We address this question through an archetype analysis based on 26 peer-reviewed articles. In each article, opportunities are identified, coded using the social-ecological system framework, and then bundled into archetypes that encompass similar opportunities reappearing across multiple cases. Results suggest that the provision of climate information can constitute an opportunity for adaptation that goes beyond purely incremental adjustments to a changing climate. Specifically, two of the six archetypes identified enable transformational adaptation by bringing long-term implications of current impacts into focus and by addressing the issue of capacity of existing institutions to respond to climate change. However, there is a high degree of heterogeneity in the characterization of opportunities, and the six archetypes only cover about one in three of the opportunities identified. This indicates the need for further research to develop more streamlined conceptualizations. In this respect, the archetypes identified herewith suggest some avenues for further conceptual development. We also explore policy implications, raising questions regarding the current development of climate services.},

journal={JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
year={2013},
volume={116},
number={NA},
pages={58-71},
month={FEB 15},
abstract={In Phoenix, Arizona and other metropolitan areas, water governance challenges include variable climate conditions, growing demands, and continued groundwater overdraft. Based on an actor-oriented examination of who does what with water and why, along with how people interact with hydro-ecological systems and man-made infrastructure, we present a sustainability appraisal of water governance for the Phoenix region. Broadly applicable to other areas, our systems approach to sustainable water governance overcomes prevailing limitations to research and management by: employing a comprehensive and integrative perspective on water systems; highlighting the activities, intentions, and rules that govern various actors, along with the values and goals driving decisions; and, establishing a holistic set of principles for social ecological system integrity and interconnectivity, resource efficiency and maintenance, livelihood sufficiency and opportunity, civility and democratic governance, intra- and inter-generational equity, and finally, precaution and adaptive capacity. This study also contributes to reforming and innovating governance regimes by illuminating how these principles are being met, or not, in the study area. What is most needed in metropolitan Phoenix is enhanced attention to ecosystem functions and resource maintenance as well as social equity and public engagement in water governance. Overall, key recommendations entail: addressing interconnections across hydrologic units and subsystems (e.g., land and water), increasing decentralized initiatives for multiple purposes (e.g., ecological and societal benefits of green infrastructure), incorporating justice goals into decisions (e.g., fair allocations and involvement), and building capacity through collaborations and social learning with diverse interests (e.g., scientists, policymakers, and the broader public).

abstract={Role-playing simulations have gained in popularity in recent years as a novel method of engaging researchers and stakeholders in a variety of social and environmental issues. While academic interest has grown on this topic, knowledge remains sparse on the underlying theories that may guide the design of such games. Thsi article introduces a new game design framework - Com-pleC-Sus (Com-plex-ity-Col-lab-o-ra-tion-Sus-tain-abil-ity) - built on the concepts of social learning and procedural rhetoric. We describe and discuss the conceptual basis for our framework, giving a detailed account of its application through the recently developed the Water-Food-Energy Nexus Game (Nexus Game) as an example. We illustrate the process involved in designing the Nexus Game through initial scoping, prototyping, and design decisions, and how game structure and debriefing have been crafted to foster social learning focused on the understanding of the underlying social-ecological system as well as fostering collaboration between stakeholders. We also provide the analysis of qualitative data collected during recent gaming sessions across three continents to evaluate the Nexus Game's potential learning effects.},

abstract={Threats to water security are on the rise globally. In the Great Lakes, major threats arise from watershed land-use practices promoting chemical and nutrient pollution. In the Maumee River Watershed (MRW), which discharges into the western basin of Lake Erie, nutrient inputs associated with harmful algal bloom events (HABs) have increased in frequency and severity over the last several decades. This includes forcing the historic shut down of the City of Toledo's drinking water supply to 400,000 residents in 2014. Conditions which favor HABs did not appear overnight. We trace the history of land-use practices that transformed the structure and function of the MRW from a balanced system into a source of nutrient dynamics favoring HABs. Successful policy intervention must treat the MRW as a complex adaptive system operating at multiple scales at the intersection of agricultural practices and conflicting socioeconomic drivers, confounding traditional interventions that focus on single factors such as water quality or fertilizer use regulation. We conclude with three interventions that policymakers can employ to help tip the scales back into an ecologically balanced system.},

abstract={The cryosphere plays a critical role in maintaining the stability of the social-ecological system, but rapid cryosphere changes have been and are wide-ranging and have a profound affect, even threatening the achievement of the UN's 2030 sustainable development goals (SDGs). In the study, we review the opportunities and threats caused by cryosphere changes in achieving the SDGs. The results reveal that cryosphere changes are significantly related to the supply of sustainable fresh water (SDG 6), alpine hydropower (SDG 7), and climate action (SDG 13). In addition, they favorably support life on land and below water (SDG 14-15), and effectively affect the livelihoods (SDG 1-5), agricultural development (SDG 2), snow/ice tourism (SDG 8), infrastructure (SDG 9), regional inequality (SDG 10), and cities and communities (SDG 11), as well as affecting Arctic shipping routes (SDG 16). Long-term cryosphere threats far outweigh their contributions to the SDGs. The cryosphere contributes little to human emissions, but it is significantly affected by climate change. Areas affected by cryosphere changes need to strengthen resilience and enhance the ability to adapt to the influences of cryosphere changes (SDG 1-17) via financial transfer, multilateral international cooperation, and other practical policies.},

title={Institutional Performance of Collective Irrigation Systems: A Fuzzy Set Qualitative Comparative Analysis in the Nile Delta of Egypt},
journal={SUSTAINABILITY},
year={2021},
volume={13},
number={3},
pages={NA},
month={FEB},
abstract={Egypt, akin to many countries in the global South, has striven to promote collective management to overcome the challenges of irrigation management since the 1990s. Establishing shared pumping stations (SPSs) has been one of the cornerstones helping farmers better manage water for irrigation. Operating SPSs successfully poses collective action problems, for which there is no single set of solutions. This paper utilizes fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to identify which conditions or configurations are sufficient or necessary for well-operated SPSs. The study draws on empirical data gathered through semi-structured interviews from 45 cases, located in Kafr El-Sheikh Governorate in Egypt's Nile Delta. Results show that three different paths are sufficient to ensure well-operated SPSs. These are: (1) the condition of effective rules related to allocation, monitoring, and sanctions; (2) the configuration of small group size of SPSs and large irrigated sizes of SPSs; or (3) the configuration of adequate water supply and appropriate location of the SPS command area. The paper concludes that neither group size nor resource size alone explains the outcome of collective action, while a combination of both factors does. Similarly, an adequate water supply is essential to enhance users' engagement in collective actions only when resource location characteristics do not provide alternative water sources for irrigation.},

abstract={Ecological regime shifts from clear to turbid water states in shallow temperate lakes are quite well-investigated phenomena but critical time lags from human interaction with the lake and restoration activities are much less understood. This is a complex challenge for institutions who manage lakes but are usually less familiar with non-linear dynamics, slow and fast influences on water quality and how to manage those from a social-ecological perspective. We extend a well-known minimal model of shallow lake regime shifts to enable simulations over time with short- and long-term management measures (nutrient reduction, trawling, planting of aquatic vegetation). While we explore the mathematical conditions for ecological bistability, we also identify the necessary and sufficient extent of measures to restore the clear water state. Restoration scenarios evaluated by trajectories in the state space demonstrate the increased effectiveness from combined measures even when considering countereffective activities such as pike fishing. But, single measures alone may delay or even miss the overall restoration target. Our analysis demonstrates the importance of understanding transient dynamics where stable state analyses alone remain elusive about alternative ways to interact with bistability. We conclude that successful management of bistable systems, and particularly shallow temperate lakes, needs careful balancing between short-term improvements and long-term influence on the systems state.},

volume={48},
number={NA},
pages={120-131},
month={JAN},
abstract={Many international river basins are likely to experience increasing water scarcity over the coming decades. This water scarcity is not rooted only in the limitation of resources, i.e. the shortage in the availability of freshwater relative to water demand, but also on social factors (e.g. flawed water planning and management approaches, institutional incapability to provide water services, unsustainable economic policies). Therefore, the assessment of water scarcity risks is not limited to the assessment of physical water supply and demand, but it requires also consideration of several socio-economic factors. In this study, we provide a comprehensive dynamic assessment of water scarcity risks for the Lower Brahmaputra river basin, a region where the hydrological impact of climate change is expected to be particularly strong and population pressure is high. The basin area of Brahmaputra River lies among four different countries: China, India, Bangladesh and Bhutan. For water scarcity assessment, we propose a novel integration of different approaches: (i) the assessment of water scarcity risk, considering complex social-ecological system; (ii) the analysis of dynamic behaviour of the system; (iii) exploration of participatory approach in which limited number of stakeholders identify the most relevant issues with reference to water scarcity risks and provide their preferences for the aggregation of risk assessment indicators. Results show that water scarcity risk is expected to slightly increase and to fluctuate remarkably as a function of the hazard signal. Social indicators show trends that can at least partially compensate the increasing trend of the drought index. The results of this study are intended to be used for contributing to planned adaptation of water resources systems, in Lower Brahmaputra River Basin. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Ecosystem restoration projects (ERPs) facilitate land degradation neutrality (LDN). However, the response dynamics and interactions of sectors within ecosystem-agriculture-economy nexus (EAEN) have not been sufficiently explored, which constrains the coordinated efficacy of LDN efforts. To bridge the knowledge gaps, the present study selected a land restoration hotspot in southeastern China as a case to investigate the simultaneous responses of the EAEN sectors to ERPs from a novel social-ecological system (SES)-based LDN perspective. Various biophysical models and Manne-Kendall trend test as well as multi-source spatially explicit data and socioeconomic statistics were applied to quantify the co-evolution of natural and socioeconomic indicators. ERPs converting cropland to woodland and grassland promoted vegetation restoration, reduced soil erosion, and enhanced carbon sequestration. However, cropland loss initially resulted in a decline in grain productivity. Policy adjustments and improvements in ecosystem restoration efforts and agricultural production conditions improved food security and increased agricultural production capacity. Effective policymaking and favorable resident engagement accelerated the transformation from a grain-production-based agriculture to diversified industries and, by extension, economic output, income, and population. The success of socioeconomic development under the SES framework for LDN demonstrated that this strategy could achieve the desired environmental, agricultural, and economic targets. EAEN under the SES conceptual framework provides an inclusive, comprehensive LDN perspective and improves ERP efficacy. The findings of the present work might be applicable to other land restoration areas challenged by the complex interactions among multidimensional factors. Comparably successful implementation of these ERPs could be realized if individual environmental and socioeconomic conditions are thoroughly considered during the formulation of coordinated development policies.},

journal={JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
year={2020},

pages={NA},
month={AUG 1},
abstract={Globally, the management of invasive plants is motivated by a desire to improve ecosystem services (e.g., recreation, flood mitigation, soil fertility for agriculture, aesthetics) and critical habitat for imperiled species. To reduce invader populations and impacts, it is important to document the social and ecological basis (i.e., the social-ecological system) for the management that has been employed and areas where a greater level of coordination among stakeholder groups (managers, scientists, legislators, resource users) could improve efforts. We present a conceptual model that builds on current thinking for how best to connect these four stakeholder groups-to foster stronger citizen lobbying for impacted resources, science-based governance, legislator-driven noxious weed laws and funding for management and science, knowledge co-production by scientists and managers, and co-management by managers and resource users. In light of our model, we present two case studies based in Nebraska and Utah, U.S.A. involving a common North American wetland invader, Phragmites australis (non-native common reed). In Nebraska, potential lawsuits stemming from water conveyance was strong motivation for funding management. In Utah, duck hunters and other resource users initially instigated management. Progress toward the successful management of Phragmites has been the result of manager-scientist partnerships addressing a knowing-doing gap among practitioners, the complexities of management mosaics, as well as overcoming economic and logistical constraints. Our model demonstrates how legislative initiatives can fund new research and bolster on-going management, while organically building strong partnerships among scientists, managers, and resource users that are key for successfully managing invasive species.},

abstract={Economic, policy, and climate changes have profoundly influenced pastoral social-ecological systems on the Tibetan Plateau. Climate change is believed to be leading to increasing extreme weather conditions such as snow disasters and droughts, putting a strain on the rangeland resources herders must have to increase income. Market-based economic reforms and interrelated development policies such as the Rangeland Household Contract Policy, the Ecological Construction Project, and herder settlement Initiatives have increased integration of pastoral regions into modern markets with promotion of tourism, expanded livestock markets, and marketing opportunities for rangeland resources. Although allocating common rangelands to households is the foundation of current rangeland management strategies to achieve these goals, it removes important technologies for coping with high variability in rangeland forage production from the traditional rangeland management portfolio on the Tibetan Plateau. These include shared risk, shared labor, seasonal and yearly herd mobility, and access to diverse areas of rangelands and multiple water sources. Field study of two villages in Guinan County of Qinghai Province, and Ruoergai County of Sichuan Province from 2011 to 2014 found that the villages responded to externally driven policy, economic, and climate changes with an innovative locally adapted quota-based grazing management system that preserves valuable management technologies, conserves rangeland resources, and provides individual opportunities for financial gain. In this way the village social-ecological system has exhibited considerable resiliency, maintaining a form of community governance that functions to manage the rangelands, improve well-being as indicated by livestock productivity, and, according to local perceptions, maintain rangeland condition. The community-based grazing quota system devised by the villages occupies a middle ground between common and individual models for resource use because it focuses more on how to equitably distribute services and utilities from rangelands, instead of how to distribute rangelands.},

title={Integrating the social, hydrological and ecological dimensions of freshwater health: The Freshwater Health Index},

abstract={Degradation of freshwater ecosystems and the services they provide is a primary cause of increasing water insecurity, raising the need for integrated solutions to freshwater management. While methods for characterizing the multifaceted challenges of managing freshwater ecosystems abound, they tend to emphasize either social or ecological dimensions and fall short of being truly integrative. This paper suggests that management for sustainability of freshwater systems needs to consider the linkages between human water uses, freshwater ecosystems and governance. We present a conceptualization of freshwater resources as part of an integrated social-ecological system and propose a set of corresponding indicators to monitor freshwater ecosystem health and to highlight priorities for management. We demonstrate an application of this new framework - the Freshwater Health Index (FHI) - in the Dongjiang River Basin in southern China, where stakeholders are addressing multiple and conflicting freshwater demands. By combining empirical and modeled datasets with surveys to gauge stakeholders' preferences and elicit expert information about governance mechanisms, the FHI helps stakeholders understand the status of freshwater ecosystems in their basin, how ecosystems are being manipulated to enhance or decrease water-related services, and howwell the existing water resource management regime is equipped to govern these dynamics over time. This framework helps to operationalize a truly integrated approach to water resource management by recognizing the interplay between governance, stakeholders, freshwater ecosystems and the services they provide.

abstract={East African wetlands are hotspots of ecosystem services, particularly for climate regulation, water provision and food production. We review the ability of current approaches to ecosystem service assessments to capture important social-ecological dynamics to provide insight for wetland management and human wellbeing. We synthesise evidence of human influences on wetlands and gauge the suitability of models and tools for simulating spatial and temporal dynamics, and land management on multiple ecosystem functions and services. Current approaches are largely unsuitable for advancing knowledge of social-ecological system dynamics and could be greatly improved with inter-disciplinary model integration to focus upon interactions between multiple ecosystem functions and services. Modelling can alleviate challenges that tropical wetland ecosystem services management faces and support decision-making of land managers and policymakers. Better understanding of social-ecological systems dynamics is crucial in East Africa where societies are vulnerable to poverty and climate variability, whilst dependent upon agrarian-ecological based economies.

abstract={Water is essential to human societies and a prerequisite for flourishing nature, especially in arid regions. Yet, climate change and socio-economic developments are expected to exacerbate current and future stresses on water resources, demanding innovative approaches to balance water needs for society and nature conservation. In this study, we use the IPBES conceptual framework to combine ecological and socio-economic insights and analyse the connections between people and nature in the water scarce Draa River Basin, southern Morocco. We study the diversity of desert benthic macroinvertebrates as one component of nature using DNA barcoding and their potential to serve as bioindicators of human impact by relating species occurrences to environmental parameters. Furthermore, based on 87 interviews with farmers and key institutional stakeholders, we investigate how farmers perceive water related changes and how water is managed in the basin. Regarding benthic macroinvertebrates, 41 families were identified, 475 DNA barcodes generated and assigned to 118 putative species (Barcode Index Numbers) of which 60 were first records. This indicates a lack of reference sequences for known, but also a potentially high number of undescribed species. Environmental parameters, which are partly influenced by human activities, such as aquatic stages, salinity and intermittency, were the most important variables explaining invertebrate richness and community composition in generalized linear models. We further describe farmers perceptions of decreasing water quality and quantity. Farmers generally believe that they are able to cope with water related changes, although perceptions are regionally differentiated with farmers downstream being less optimistic. With growing concerns, water policies currently locus on increasing water supply and less on reducing water demands. Based on these findings, the usefulness of the IPBES framework for understanding social-ecological system dynamics is reflected, and recommendations for future freshwater management and research are derived.

abstract={The process of learning in social-ecological systems is an emerging area of research, but little attention has been given to how social and ecological interactions motivate or inhibit learning. This is highly relevant to the South African water sector, where a major policy transition is occurring that provides local water users and managers with new opportunities to engage in adaptive learning about how to balance human and ecological needs for water. In this paper, an agent-based model is used to explore potential `learning dilemmas', or barriers to learning in the South African water sector, whereby human perceptions combined with social-ecological conditions affect the capacity, understanding, and willingness required to learn. Agents manage water according to different management strategies and use various indicators to evaluate their success. The model shows that in areas with highly variable hydrological regimes, agents may be less able to learn because conditions are too unpredictable for them to benefit from past experience. Because of these changing conditions, however, agents are more likely to try new water management strategies, promoting a greater diversity of experience in the system for agents to learn from in the future. In water-stressed areas, where agents tend to have greater difficulty fulfilling demand for water than in areas with abundant water supplies, they are also more apt to try new strategies. When learning is restricted to small areas, agents may learn more quickly but based on a more narrow range of experience than in larger or more heterogeneous areas. These results suggest a need to enhance learning so that it accounts for interacting hydrological, ecological, and social dynamics. Although the model is a highly stylised version of reality, this preliminary exploration may eventually help to reverse the past trend of poor understanding of social-ecological dynamics as they relate to water management.},

abstract={``Environmental flows{''} is a research discipline that emphasizes freshwater allocation in rivers to sustain desired ecological conditions and human well-being. The basis for environmental flow requirements has traditionally relied on hydrological and ecological data. Contemporary methods focus on detailed hydro-ecological relationships within river ecosystems; however, there is currently no structured approach to systematically incorporate socially relevant data into the environmental flows discipline. To address this limitation we developed a flexible framework that applies a social-ecological systems approach to account for multiple flow-related objectives that reflect both biophysical sustainability and societal preferences. First, we conceptualize the freshwater social-ecological system as a hierarchy of human and environmental domains. Then, we recommend stepwise procedures to assess flow-related vulnerabilities of important system attributes, address their feedbacks, and translate these assessments to a common classification for comparative analyses that guide holistic flow management decisions.},

abstract={Mountains are social-ecological systems exposed to multiple climatic and socioeconomic drivers. The Pyrenees are a clear example of the concomitant challenges that these regions face, as they are exposed to stressors linked to depopulation, an economic shift towards tourism, and climate change. To understand how these multiple stressors affect the system's resources, it is useful to study them from a social-ecological system (SES) perspective. Focusing on a Pyrenean SES, we use piecewise structural equation modeling and network analysis to quantitatively describe the interactions between water resources, biodiversity, and the social and economic elements of the system. Our results show that the current economic focus and dependency on tourism severely impact water resources and biodiversity. Future climatic scenarios forecast a worsening of the pressures on the hydrological system and may threaten winter tourism. Actions to alleviate the pressures on water and biodiversity and to increase socioeconomic resilience are a priority. We argue that such actions will have to include both a diversification of the region's touristic offer and of the economy, coupled with a more sustainable use of water resources. Our findings highlight the importance of studying the interactions and causal relationships between SES elements. This can help gain a comprehensive understanding of how the SES functions and its sustainability challenges.},

abstract={It is becoming increasingly clear that the threat to the use of natural landscapes and persistent droughts are affecting the water quality of rural communities. The socio-ecological fit emerges as an aid to advance in the search for solutions to environmental problems in rural communities. Consequently, between May 2016 and September 2021, an interdisciplinary study of community-based water quality monitoring (CWQM) was implemented at a coastal catchment in the Nuble region, Central Chile. The objective of the study was to involve the participation of local communities in initiatives to control the water quality of various parameters {[}pH, total iron (Fe-T), alkalinity as CaCO3, hardness (Ca2+ and Mg2+), sodium (Na+) and potassium (K+), water temperature, sulfate (SO42-) chloride (Cl-), and nitrate (NO3-)] in groundwater, share local knowledge, and apply co-creative measures for improving water conservation. In situ chemical data were also analyzed in the laboratory to check data quality. The PHREEQC hydrogeochemical model is used to characterize hydrogeochemical parameters of groundwater and to know about hydrogeochemical processes related to water quality. High levels of NO3- and Fe-T are recorded in 75\% of the groundwater samples, mainly when water scarcity is higher during the summer. According to Chilean standards, nitrate levels exceed the maximum permissible limits for drinking water. A type of mainly Ca (Mg)-HCO3- carbonated water was recorded with Ca2+, Na+, Mg2+, and HCO3- as dominant ions. This study demonstrated the opportunity of a rural community group to help fill spatial data gaps in water quality monitoring and reassess water quality protection, especially considering the decrease in water availability in the region. Therefore, the community together with researchers can respond with an early alert system to water quality to collaborate with the implementation of rural drinking established on a community-based water quality monitoring. Moreover, to prioritize the level of urgency of rural water, minimize water pollution and improve the perception of the water and the resilience of their social-ecological system.},

abstract={This study assesses social vulnerability to hazards by analyzing the nature of biophysical hazards, and the characteristics of exposures, susceptibilities and adaptive capacities in Kumasi. A mixed method approach was used to collect primary data from farms and nearby markets. Water, soil, and plant samples were collected and tested for total coliforms and cadmium. Primary dataset was also collected from farmers and vendors using structured interview guide and from key informants through in-depth interviews. The analysis shows that several pressures residing within the coupled social-ecological system are threats to the health and livelihood of the farmers and vendors. The concentration of cadmium and total coliform in irrigation water, soil, and plants exceeded the WHO/FAO acceptable standards. Bio-toxins in plants were also found to be potentially high. However, the degree of exposure to these stressors and the strength of response and adaptive capacities were determined to be dependent on position within the urban agriculture value chain, type of plant, and socio-demographic characteristics. The study concludes that pollution of irrigation water, soil, and plant is an issue of environmental concern in the urban agriculture system and requires concerted efforts of all stakeholders to address. It is recommended that there should be frequent monitoring of the quality of irrigation water, soil, and produce from urban farms and markets to assess their physical, chemical, and microbial properties and possibly initiate remedial measures where necessary. Government policies must also focus on building the resilience of urban farmers and vendors to reduce their vulnerability to biophysical hazards.},

abstract={Environmental flows (e-flows) management takes place within a complex social-ecological system, necessitating the involvement of diverse stakeholders and an appreciation of a range of perspectives and knowledge types. It is widely accepted that incorporating participatory methods into environmental flows decision-making will allow stakeholders to become meaningfully involved, improving potential solutions, and fostering social legitimacy. However, due to substantial structural barriers, implementing participatory approaches can be difficult for water managers. This paper assesses the effectiveness of an e-flows methodology that combines elements of structured decision-making and participatory modeling, whilst constrained by project resources. Three process-based objectives were identified by the group at the start of the process: improving transparency, knowledge exchange, and community ownership. We evaluated the success of the approach according to those objectives using semi-structured interviews and thematic analysis. In evaluating how well the participatory approach achieved the process objectives, we found that at least 80\% of respondents expressed positive sentiment in every category (n = 15). We demonstrate that the values-based process objectives defined by the participant group are an effective tool for evaluating participatory success. This paper highlights that participatory approaches can be effective even in resource-constrained environments when the process is adapted to fit the decision-making context.},

abstract={Rice production in coastal wetlands provides critical ecosystem services that range from flood control to wildlife habitat. In the Iberian Peninsula rice was introduced in the 10th Century. Today Iberian rice accounts for about one quarter of the total rice production of the European Union, almost exclusively cultivated in the coastal wetlands of Spain, with permanent flooding. The intensive water management required to produce rice stands at a crucial point since freshwater supply is deteriorating at an unprecedented rate. Here we explore flexible adaptation options to climate change in the Doana wetlands - a world heritage and biodiversity site - from two points of view: What are the policy options for agricultural water management in view of climate change? How can informed stakeholders contribute to better adaptation? The first question is addressed by simulating water availability to farmers with the WAAPA model under a range of adaptation policy options derived from the view of the local communities. The second question was addressed by means of participatory research. Adaptation options are framed according to the local environmental, social and policy context. Results suggest that perception on the potential role of new water infrastructure and farming subsidies dominates the view of local communities. The choices of the stakeholders that could be simulated with the hydrological model, were quantified in terms of additional water availability for the rice farming, therefore providing a quantitative measure to the qualitative solutions. Information provided during the study shaped the final adaptation options developed. Our research contributes to the definition of sustainable rice production in Europe.},

volume={16},
number={2, SI},
pages={429-443},
month={FEB},
abstract={This study takes an historical approach in order to establish how the form and function of the social-ecological system that represents the Bangladesh south-western coastal zone has changed over recent decades. Time series data for a range of ecosystem services and drivers are analysed to define the range of trends, the presence of change points, slow and fast variables and the significant drivers of change. Since the 1980s, increasing gross domestic product and per capita income mirror rising levels of food and inland fish production. As a result, the size of population below the poverty line has reduced by similar to 17 \%. In contrast, non-food ecosystem services such as water availability, water quality and land stability have deteriorated. Conversion of rice fields to shrimp farms is almost certainly a factor in increasing soil and surface water salinity. Most of the services experienced statistically significant change points between 1975 and 1980, and among the services, water availability, shrimp farming and maintenance of biodiversity appear to have passed tipping points. An environmental Kuznets curve analysis suggests that the point at which growing economic wealth feeds back into effective environmental protection has not yet been reached for water resources. Trends in indicators of ecosystem services and human well-being point to widespread non-stationary dynamics governed by slowly changing variables with an increased likelihood of systemic threshold changes/tipping points in the near future. The results will feed into simulation models and strategies that can define alternative and sustainable paths for land management.},

abstract={Based on a five-town case-study cohort in Kenya, a conceptual framework has been developed to enable the formulation of holistic and effective strategies that encompass the national aspirations and regional to global sustainability agendas, and which can be used to monitor progress in achieving set objectives. The approach is flexible, scalable and transferrable, so that it can be applied in different contexts and using different indicators, based upon the same construct. Insufficient technical knowledge of urban aquifers and their interplay with the wider social-ecological system constrains the development of holistic, effective and robust management systems to ensure their sustainability for intended uses. The objective was to consider governance and management solutions that could promote water security for urban towns in Kenya through the sustainable use of groundwater in the context of its complex hydrogeology, water access disparities, competing uses and future risks. The in force national and county water policies, strategies, and plans for the case study areas were critically reviewed. The status of aquifer knowledge, water access disparities, competing uses, and risks was evaluated from critical literature reviews and data compilation, fieldwork, and analysis of indicator datasets from the Kenya 2009 census. Key aquifers need urgent characterisation to reverse the current situation whereby development proceeds with insufficient aquifer knowledge. Private sector and public participation in management should be enhanced through decentralised management approaches. Water infrastructure and technologies should be fit-for-purpose in application and scale, and the pro-poor focus should be underpinned by appropriately focused management regimes.},

abstract={Communities in dryland ecosystems face multiple stressors that threaten their livelihood resilience. While community resilience in socio-ecological systems is largely determined by access to and sustainable management of natural resources, the underlying mechanisms are still poorly understood. This study, which uses grounded theory integrated with discourse analysis, aims to contribute addressing this knowledge gap. First, we explore global literature describing trends and patterns in the various stressors-including climate change, frequent drought, and famine, ecological, socio-economic, and institutional stressors-that impact the livelihood resilience of these communities, with the goal of summarizing how multiple stressors impact the sustainability of dryland social-ecological systems. Then, using the sustainable development goals (SDGs) as a reference target, we propose potential entry points to support livelihood resilience pathways. These include land, water, livestock and agroforestry, and institutional and social capital. Lastly, we suggest an integrated multi-scalar pathway embedded with cross-sectorial policies and differential cross-social strategies towards combining resilience with SDGs targets. This research can help stakeholders to adapt to and mitigate the impacts of various stressors, ultimately strengthening livelihood resilience in dryland ecosystems.},

abstract={This article proposes a new theoretical explanation to the question of environmental governance failures, combining micro and macro explanations in the long run. We put forward the concept of Transversal Transaction Costs (TTCs) as a critical source of governance failures. TTCs are transaction costs induced by interlinkages between public policies and property rights, an area under-investigated by the natural resources governance literature. We emphasise that TTCs are consequential in limiting the ability of environmental governance to coordinate natural resource uses. Drawing on institutional complementary and cluster literature, we argue that TTCs increased significantly over the years shaping governance evolution at the macro level in the long run. We show that institutional resource regimes tend to get locked into an Institutional Complexity Trap (ICT), which prevents improvement in coordination capacity and explains the persistence of environmental governance failures. Four cases substantiate our conceptual proposition of transversal transaction costs. In addition, the process-tracing of six water governance cases in Europe from 1750 to 2004 provides empirical support to the macro dynamics of institutional complexity trap.},

title={A social-ecological framework for analyzing and designing integrated crop-livestock systems from farm to territory levels},

volume={32},

pages={43-56},
month={FEB},
abstract={Integrated crop-livestock systems are often considered a promising way to address agricultural sustainability issues. Many authors claim that complementarities and synergies between crops and livestock can improve nutrient cycling and delivery of ecosystem services (ES) in agricultural systems. They have analyzed effects of interactions at the farm level and affirmed the potential advantage of developing crop-livestock interactions at the territory level. However, potential benefits of developing synergies beyond the farm level have not been clearly identified. Thus, we developed a conceptual framework that can be used to analyze, design and perform integrated assessment of crop-livestock systems at the territory level. To address crop-livestock interaction issues, we define it as a social-ecological system called the territorial crop-livestock system (TCLS). The ecological system is represented as three interacting components, crops, grasslands and animals, allowing description of various land uses and their potential effects on nutrient cycling and ES. The social system, represented as farmers interacting with natural-resource managers and agro-food chain actors, determines land use and the nature and intensity of ES delivered. We highlight the importance of coordination and learning among actors to support implementation of complex adaptive systems such as TCLSs. We illustrate the expressive power of our conceptual framework through development of a generic typology of crop-livestock systems. Then we show how our conceptual framework can be used as an intermediary object with stakeholders in participatory design approaches. We illustrate this process by representing four archetypal TCLSs. We provide an example of the design approach implemented in Southwestern France to address severe recurrent water shortages, which includes analysis of land use in the current crop-livestock system and the associated key metabolic and ES issues, identification of options for change and multi-criteria analysis of these options. We conclude that this framework shows great potential to support development of sustainable farming systems at the territory level.},

abstract={Understanding social-ecological interactions is a major research priority for sustainable management. However, the scarcity in multi-decadal records represents a big gap in information that hinders the development of above research. In this paper, we propose a framework to explore the long-term dynamic mechanisms between social and ecological systems, and present a case study in the Erhai basin, southwest China. Using paleolimnological proxies to reconstruct the long-term trends of ecological changes, the social-ecological system (SES) framework links the variations of ecosystem services (ESs) and ecosystem functions with social policies. According to the results of the Erhai basin, there were increasing social demands and wanted provisioning ESs but degraded ecosystem functions over the last 70 years. Typically, the introduction of four major Chinese carps since the 1950s, the construction of hydropower stations on the Xi'er river since the 1970s, and the development of tourism since the 1990s, have been implemented to meet the social demands for wanted fish provisioning, hydroelectricity provisioning, and culture services respectively. Although there were temporary benefits in above desired services, improper strategies have gradually impaired the functions of native fish diversity, hydrodynamic forces, and nutrient cycling. Degraded ecosystem functions threatened the sustainable provision of wanted ESs, which motivated the implementation of subsequent social policies, such as the fishing ban after the 1950s, water level control after the 1970s and restoration projects after the 1990s. By rounds of renewed social drivers/ policies, the social system and ecosystem in the Erhai basin are tightly connected in the form of a feedback loop in the SES, rendering dynamic changes in wanted ESs. The current social-ecological trap in the Erhai basin emphasizes the significance of SES framework and advantages of a paleolimnological approach in revealing the long-term SES dynamics, which can help tailor proper management measures in the future.},

abstract={Large hydrologic basins involve multiple stakeholders, and coupled dynamic social and ecological processes. Managing such basins has long been a challenge. Balancing the demand for water from nature against that from humans is always difficult, particularly in arid watersheds. Here, we analyze potential institutional causes of ecological degradation and how it can be reversed by introducing new forms of governance. The framework and assumptions are illustrated using China's second-largest endorheic basin, where empirical evidence shows that the introduction of a new governing authority connecting midstream and downstream actors facilitated the establishment of a new governance regime that is better aligned with the biophysical scales of the watershed. A trans-regional water allocation project initiated by the new higher-level authority successfully rescued downstream oases and restored a dried terminal lake. These outcomes suggest that when social and ecological structures are better aligned our ability to manage the interplay between social and ecological processes increases. However, the lack of direct connection between the actors of the middle and lower reaches resulted in the paradox of an increase in water demand. We therefore suggest that measures to stimulate the emergence of horizontal social ties linking different critical groups of actors across the watershed could further the alignment of the institutional and biophysical structures-without these changes sustainable management of river basins and other common pool resources will remain problematic.

abstract={Ongoing urban expansion may degrade natural resources, ecosystems, and the services they provide to human societies, e.g., through land use and water changes and feedbacks. In order to control and minimize such negative impacts of urbanization, best practices for sustainable urban development must be identified, supported, and reinforced. To accomplish this, assessment methods and tools need to consider the couplings and feedbacks between social and ecological systems, as the basis for improving the planning and management of urban development. Collaborative efforts by academics, urban planners, and other relevant actors are also essential in this context. This will require relevant methods and tools for testing and projecting scenarios of coupled social-ecological system (CSES) behavior, changes, and feedbacks, in support of sustainable development of growing cities. This paper presents a CSES modeling approach that can provide such support, by coupling socio-economically driven land use changes and associated hydrological changes. The paper exemplifies and tests the applicability of this approach for a concrete case study with relevant data availability, the Tyresan catchment in Stockholm County, Sweden. Results show that model integration in the approach can reveal impacts of urbanization on hydrological and water resource, and the implications and feedbacks for urban societies and ecosystems. The CSES approach introduces new model challenges, but holds promise for improved model support towards sustainable urban development.},

abstract={Small and shallow alluvial aquifers in arid and semi-arid regions compose an important water system that smallholder farmers rely on for irrigation and livestock feeding. Geological settings and the small scale of these aquifers suggest the need for governance at the local level, but research supporting its development is still scarce. Treating a case of alluvial aquifers exploited by smallholder farmers located in the Brazilian semi-arid region as a common pool resource (CPR), this paper analyses the governance of a social-ecological system (SES) for which an alluvial aquifer is an essential source of water. The paper applies the SES Framework to analyse the SES in light of Ostrom's principles for sustainable CPR management to answer the questions: (1) can the governance arrangements support sustainable common pool resource management of the alluvial aquifers? (2) what opportunities are there to make the management of the aquifer more sustainable through community-based governance? (3) can Ostrom's design principles lead the transition to more sustainable governance of alluvial aquifers? Despite a water policy aiming for decentralisation and participatory governance, gaps in the implementation of these policies are identified. Taking into account the challenges imposed by the aquifer characteristics to impact efficient groundwater exploitation, equity in water distribution and conservation of the CPR, the analysis reveals opportunities to improve CPR management by supporting the community to increase participation in the governance of the aquifer in coordination with existing policies. This work concludes with suggestions that could empower community progress towards more sustainable governance of the aquifer.},

abstract={We implemented the semantically open conceptual framework `Multi-Scale Integrated Analysis of Societal and Ecosystem Metabolism' (MuSIASEM) to deal with nexus challenges in agricultural production systems in transboundary river basins, using the Iranian Aras River Basin as a case study. The performance of the agricultural sector was characterized for relevant typologies of crop production using metabolic profiles, i.e., inputs and outputs per ton of crop produced, per hectare of land use, and per hour of labor. This analysis was contextualized across hierarchical levels of analysis, including the agronomic context at the regional level (rainfed versus irrigated cultivation), the socio-economic and political context at the national level (food sovereignty; urbanization), and the hydro-ecological context of the larger transboundary river basin (water constraints, GHG emissions). We found that the simultaneous use of two different interrelated logics of aggregation-the productivity of land and labor (relevant for the agronomic and socio-economic dimension) and the density of flows under different land uses (relevant for the hydrological and ecological dimension)-allowed for the identification of trade-offs in policy deliberations. In the case of Iran, it showed that striving for strategic autonomy will exacerbate the current water crisis; with the current cropping patterns, agronomic improvements will not suffice to avert a water crisis. It was concluded that the proposed approach fills an important gap in nexus research, but to effectively guide nexus governance in the region, a co-production of the analysis with social actors as well as more complete data sets at the river basin level would be essential.},

title={Individual and collective political efficacy predict farmer engagement and support for groundwater policies: implications from the California Sustainable Groundwater Management Act},
journal={ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
year={2024},
volume={29},
number={1},
pages={NA},
month={JAN},
abstract={Common-pool resource theory suggests that the direct participation of local natural resource users in the management of common-pool resources can lead to effective management regimes. Nevertheless, the drivers of participation in common-pool resource management, including policy decision processes, and the effects of participation on stakeholder attitudes and policy preferences are relatively understudied. Here, we combine the social-ecological system (SES) framework with the political science concept of political efficacy to examine both contextual and personal drivers of farmer participation in California, USA's 2014 Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA), as well as the effect of participation on support for policy mechanisms from the SGMA. We surveyed a total of 553 farmers in three counties across the California Central Valley and Central Coast. Overall, we find that < 50\% of the farmers surveyed have participated in any SGMA-related events, with attending a meeting being the most common (45\%), and testifying before a board being the least common (6\%). Participation in any type of SGMA policy event was associated with multiple characteristics of the groundwater SES context, including the resource system (farm size) and actor attributes (farm bureau membership and receiving information about the policy), that likely combine to indicate a higher level of social, financial, and built capital. Higher participation was also associated with higher internal efficacy ratings, i.e., an individual's self-assessment of their ability to understand and participate in the political process. Higher levels of internal efficacy were also correlated with support for both incentive-and regulatory-based policy mechanisms, as well as the perception that groundwater impacts are occurring now or soon, and exclusive reliance on groundwater. These results demonstrate that political competence and experience with policy processes and programs are not only associated with participation in current policy issues, which is widely recognized in existing research, but are also associated with mechanisms, in with more mechanisms.},

abstract={Societal values are generally seen as leading to changes in human decisions and behavior, but have not been addressed adequately in current water management, which is blind to changes in the social drivers for, or societal responses to, management decisions. This paper describes the evolution of the societal value of water resources in Australia over a period of 169 years. These values were classified into two groups: those supporting economic development versus those supporting environmental sustainability. The Sydney Morning Herald newspaper was used as the main data source to track the changes in the societal value of water resources. Content analysis was used to create a description of the evolution of these societal values. Mathematical regression analysis, in combination of transition theory, was used to determine the stages of transition of the societal value, and the co-evolved social-ecological framework was used to explain how the evolution of societal values interacted with water management policies and practices, and droughts. Key findings included that the transition of the societal value of water resources fitted the sigmoid curve - a conceptual S curve for the transition of social systems. Also, the transition of the societal value of water resources in Australia went through three stages: (1) pre-development (1900s-1962), when the societal value of water resources was dominated by economic development; (2) take-off (1963-1980), when the societal value of water resources reflected the increasing awareness of the environment due to the outbreak of pollution events; (3) acceleration (1981-2011), when the environment-oriented societal value of water resources combined with the Millennium Drought to trigger a package of policy initiatives and management practices focused on sustainable water resource use. The approach developed in this study, provides a roadmap for the development of new disciplines across social and natural science. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

volume={31},

month={MAR},
abstract={The Florida Everglades, the largest subtropical wetland in North America, is in the midst of one of the most comprehensive and expensive environmental restoration efforts in history. Over the past 150 years, the Everglades has suffered substantial degradation due to massive drainage projects, polluting agricultural practices, and urban population growth. Decades of scientific investigation have shown that phosphorus (P) pollution is a primary driver of this environmental decline. This paper reviews how and why specific P-management goals and strategies have been adopted in support of Everglades restoration, focusing on the often-contentious process for converting science into restoration policies and standards. We synthesize current P-management successes, failures, and tradeoffs, including the challenge of balancing multiple hydrologic and water quality restoration goals with the priorities and values of a diverse group of stakeholders. We then highlight promising future directions for Everglades P policy and propose questions to help guide the discussion of future restoration priorities and research needs in this and other complex social-ecological systems. The overall goals of this review are thus twofold: (1) to support an in-depth understanding of the past, present, and potential future of P management approaches in this globally unique social-ecological system; and (2) to provide a broader framework for understanding how the coevolution of science and policy can support or undermine large-scale ecosystem restoration.},

title={The role of social learning in adaptiveness: insights from water management},

abstract={The article introduces the notion of adaptiveness and discusses the role of social learning in it. Adaptiveness refers to the capacity of a social actor or social-ecological system to adapt in response to, or in anticipation of, changes in the environment. We explore arguments both from a theoretical perspective and through illustrations from case studies of water management in the Alps of Europe and Mekong in southeast Asia. We propose and illustrate that social learning processes are important for building adaptiveness in several ways and at different scales. Social learning can help cope with informational uncertainty; reduce normative uncertainty; build consensus on criteria for monitoring and evaluation; empower stakeholders to take adaptive actions; reduce conflicts and identify synergies between adaptations; and improve fairness of decisions and actions. Findings in the case studies provide some support for these generalizations but often with caveats related to diversity of stakeholder interests, levels of shared understanding versus contested knowledge and scale of coordination. For this reason, we suggest that future work pays greater attention to issues of agency, knowledge and scale: What strategies have individuals and organizations pursued in successful examples of social learning? How are the boundaries and interactions between science, policy and practice managed? How does social learning occur across spatial and temporal scales?},

journal={JOURNAL OF LAND USE SCIENCE},

abstract={This study documents the event chronology and causes of land-use change in a deltaic region of the Philippines since the beginnings of aquaculture in the late nineteenth century. Satellite images and topographic maps spanning the period 1972-2013 were processed to map fishponds and the natural habitats over which they have encroached. Historical archives were consulted and interviews were conducted to understand the historical exploitation of local natural resources and the reasons behind the recorded land changes. Results showed that aquaculture developed in the late nineteenth century and expanded subsequently across the landscape under a succession of forcing factors. The global market, for example, played an early role but a number of land-use changes were also a direct response to changing environmental constraints and natural hazards. These cumulative events have promoted continuous gain in favor of aquaculture, to the detriment of other land-use options.},

abstract={The complex social-ecological systems network is an integrative platform of ecology, economy, management and complex networks which providing a new perspective on the comprehensive management of ecological and socio economical processes. Through research of the structures, functions and processes, one four-dimensional conceptual model of the complex social-ecological system for sustainable development was set up. The complex social-ecological systems comprise of natural subsystem, social subsystem, economic subsystem and integrative decision subsystem. The complex social-ecological systems network was defined as one six-element tuple which denotes the comprehensive spatial structure with different kinds of nodes of ecosystem, social system and economic system. The complex social-ecological systems network has some important characteristics including hierarchies, power-low, vulnerabilities, resilience, dynamics, co-evolution of flow and structure, et al. At last, based on the Multimedia Environment Pollutant Assessment System (MEPAS) of US EPA, the relationship between POPs (Persistent Organic Pollutants) exposure and lifetime fatal cancer risk was studied, and comprehensive risk network of the Taihu basin water pollution and human body health was established.},

title={Social Ecological Dynamics of Catchment Resilience},

year={2021},
volume={13},

pages={NA},
month={FEB},
abstract={Catchment resilience is the capacity of a combined social ecological system, comprised of water, land, ecological resources and communities in a river basin, to deal with sudden shocks and gradual changes, and to adapt and self-organize for progressive change and transform itself for sustainability. This paper proposes that analysis of catchments as social ecological systems can provide key insights into how social and ecological dynamics interact and how some of the negative consequences of unsustainable resource use or environmental degradation can be ameliorated. This requires recognition of the potential for community resilience as a core element of catchment resilience, and moves beyond more structural approaches to emphasize social dynamics. The proposals are based on a review of social ecological systems research, on methods for analyzing community resilience, and a review of social science and action research that suggest ways of generating resilience through community engagement. These methods and approaches maximize insights into the social dynamics of catchments as complex adaptive systems to inform science and practice.},

pages={NA},

abstract={Understanding the regime shifts of social-ecological systems (SES) and their local and spillover effects over a long time frame is important for future sustainability. We provide a perspective of processes unfolding over time to identify the regime shifts of a SES based on changes in the relationships between SES components while also addressing their drivers and local and spillover effects. The applicability of this approach has been demonstrated by analyzing the evolution over the past 1000 years of the SES in China's Loess Plateau (LP). Five evolutionary phases were identified: ``fast expansion of cultivation,{''} ``slow expansion of cultivation,{''} ``landscape engineering for higher production,{''} ``transition from cultivation to ecological conservation,{''} and ``revegetation for environment.{''} Our study establishes empirical links between the state (phase) of a SES to its drivers and effects. Lessons of single-goal driven and locally focused SES management in the LP, which did not consider these links, have important implications to long-term planning and policy formulation of SES.},

abstract={The problem of supporting decision-and policy-makers in managing issues related to solid waste and water quality was addressed within the context of a participatory modeling framework in the Sagarmatha National Park and Buffer Zone in Nepal. We present the main findings of management-oriented research projects conducted within this framework, thus providing an overview of the current situation in the park regarding solid waste and water quality issues. We found that most of the solid waste generated in the park is composed of organic matter, paper, and minor reused waste that is mainly reused for cattle feeding and manure, while disposal of other nondegradable categories of collected waste (glass, metal, and plastic) is not properly managed. Particularly, burning or disposal in open dumps poses a great hazard to environmental, human, and animal health, as most dump sites situated close to water courses are prone to regular flooding during the rainy season, thereby directly contaminating river water. Pollutants and microbiological contamination in water bodies were found and anthropogenic activities and hazardous practices such as solid waste dump sites, open defecation, and poor conditions of existing septic tanks are suggested as possibly affecting water quality. Collection of these data on solid waste and water quality and compilation of management information on the targeted social-ecological system allowed us to develop consensus-building models to be used as management supporting tools. By implementing such models, we were able to simulate scenarios identifying and evaluating possible management solutions and interventions in the park. This work reveals insights into general dynamics that can support the quest for solutions to waste and water quality management problems in other protected areas and mountain landscapes where traditional livelihood and land use patterns are changing under the influence of a growing population, changing consumption patterns, and international tourism.},

abstract={Carbon emissions in an industrialized world have created two problems for coral reefs: climate change and ocean acidification. Climate change drives ocean warming, which impacts biological and ecological reef processes, triggers large-scale coral bleaching events, and fuels tropical storms. Ocean acidification slows reef growth, alters competitive interactions, and impairs population replenishment. For managers and policymakers, ocean warming and acidification represent an almost paradoxical challenge by eroding reef resilience and simultaneously increasing the demand for reef resilience. Here, I address this problem in the context of challenges and potential solutions. Management efforts can compensate for reduced coral reef resilience in the face of global change, but to a limited extent and over a limited time frame. Critically, a realistic perspective on what sustainability measures can be achieved for coral reefs in the face of ocean warming and acidification is important to avoid setting unachievable goals for regional and local-scale management programs.},

title={Socio-Hydrological Approach for Water Resource Management and Human Well-Being in Pinglin District, Taiwan},

year={2023},
volume={15},

pages={NA},
month={SEP},
abstract={Despite being a limited resource, pollution, poor management, and other drivers like climate change make available water unsuitable and insufficient for human consumption and ecosystem maintenance. Therefore, a transdisciplinary approach is needed for managing this precious resource. The overall aim of this paper is to address water inequalities and improve human well-being using an integrated approach of key informant interviews, hydrological modeling, and the payment of ecosystem services (PES) scheme in Pinglin District, Taiwan. This site is an upstream area of Feicui Reservoir, which protects the downstream tap water supply. Key informant interviews were conducted to identify the gaps in and challenges to water resource management. This was followed by a scenario-based hydrological simulation using a Water Evaluation and Planning (WEAP) tool to project future water quality by the year 2050 (using biochemical oxygen demand and total coliform content as key indicator parameters) and to trace the factors responsible for water pollution. Survey analysis of key informant interviews depicts that this area is facing several challenges, such as lack of water infrastructure, agricultural subsidy, construction restrictions, etc., which cumulatively cause water scarcity in the upstream regions. On the other hand, hydrological simulation results show that population decline and climate change under an RCP 8.5 scenario will have an enormous negative impact on water quality. The concentrations of BOD and E. coli in river water will expand by 110.1\% and 117.3\%, respectively, by 2050 compared to 2018. Finally, the results of the study suggest that the PES scheme can play a positive role in enabling integrated water resource management. For example construction of a small-scale wastewater treatment plant in the upstream area will reduce the total E. coli concentration by up to 90\%. While the initial cost of construction will be taken care of by the government, the operation and management cost of this infrastructure will be covered by people living downstream, who need to pay only \$0.10 per year per person. The obtained results should be vital for both the stakeholders and decision-makers in this region.},

journal={WATER ECONOMICS AND POLICY},
year={2019},
volume={5},
number={1, SI},
pages={NA},
month={JAN},
abstract={The action situation is a core component of actor-centered institutional analysis of natural resource governance. Institutional analysis frameworks have been extended to observe multiple situations structured into networks. If further operationalized, this extension can improve policy diagnosis of human-environmental interactions. This paper proposes two complementary ways to move in that direction. First, we propose the use of qualitative configurational analysis and game theory to study the interactions between situations and assess the contribution of each to a desired outcome. Second, we draw on centrality measures to assess the benefits and risks of implementing policies that aim to change the equilibria in action situations. Both analytical strategies are applied to two cases involving irrigation and energy governance. In the Spanish case, centrality of the water allocation situation justifies a configuration of drought measures that also tackle cooperation in monitoring and infrastructure maintenance. In the Indian case, groundwater governance and adequate infrastructure capacity provision are necessary preconditions to enable coordinated technology adoption, which facilitates incentives for regulated irrigation. In both the cases, some action situations' positive outcomes are necessary in every configuration to guarantee optimal equilibria in the network. In the context of energy-fed irrigation systems, the proposed analytical strategies permit integrating interactions between water use, energy use and food production decisions in policy diagnoses. The analysis can be extended to identify archetypes, network closure, as well as structural and functional connectivity of networks in social-ecological systems.},

abstract={Rivers are social-ecological systems. Yet, in urban contexts, they have often been degraded to lifeless conduits, failing to promote human-nature interactions. As a countermeasure, river restoration has progressively been implemented globally to improve rivers' ecological quality and rejuvenate human-nature connections. In China, urban river restoration has been facilitated to improve river water quality and enhance nature-based recreation. Despite this nation-driven effort towards restoration, scholarly understanding of whether and how river restoration could align with societal preferences remains scarce. This study examined the social-ecological interactions associated with urban rivers with a social science methodology; a questionnaire survey was conducted at three Water Museums in three Chinese cities in summer 2022 and collected 654 responses from highly educated respondents. The results revealed an appreciation for rivers' environmental and recreational value among urban residents, with childhood experiences playing a role in shaping these evaluations and perceptions. Respondents generally preferred prioritizing biological elements in urban river restoration. They also stress the importance of a balanced approach, integrating nature conservation and recreational functionality while maintaining physical water access. These findings challenge the current approach of urban river restoration in the three Chinese cities, which tend to emphasize aesthetic and recreational aspects over comprehensive ecological considerations. The ANCOVA analysis further indicated that preferences for river restoration are influenced by individuals' perceptions of the positive and negative social-ecological impacts of rivers, emphasizing the need to enhance environmental awareness regarding river ecosystems. Finally, in alignment with China's vision of promoting human-nature harmony, the study advocated for strategies that harmonize ecological functionality with societal needs in urban river management.},

abstract={Ecosystem services are a telling concept to discuss the integrated management of natural resources, such as integrated water and soil, with non-academic stakeholders. Stakeholders have different perceptions regarding the management of various ecosystem services, which is challenging when aiming to develop and foster sustainable ecosystem management. We performed a stakeholder analysis as part of a social-ecological study in preparation of a decision support system for integrated water management within the Lake Manyara sub-basin (LMSB), Tanzania. The area includes a National Park and UNESCO Biosphere Reserve. A group discussion listed 26 stakeholders, categorized according to the sector, influence, and interest. The stakeholders were grouped into six functional categories: local Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs), other civil society groups, Belgian and international NGOs, authorities, academics associated to international donors and the private sector. We empirically identified advantages, shortcomings and associated risks when performing a stakeholder analysis with an interest-influence matrix. Confounding factors may include, e.g., the omission of important stakeholders, a different understanding of `influence' and `interest', or the omission of fragile groups. Instead of `low' or `high' interest and influence, we propose the terms `supportive', `potentially supportive', `unsupportive', `not interested', `low or no influence' and `antagonistic'. Further, we consider stakeholders who directly extract resources from the social-ecological system (SES) as a separate category, because of their direct dependence and impact on the SES. This improved stakeholder analysis framework for developing decision support systems in water basins can contribute to better analysis, understanding and management of aquatic social-ecological systems in general.},

abstract={As the complexity and interconnectedness of present-day social-ecological systems become steadily more apparent, there is increasing pressure on governments, policy makers, and managers to take a systems approach to the challenges facing humanity. However, how can this be done in the face of system complexity and uncertainties? In this paper we briefly discuss practical ways that policy makers can take up the systems challenge. We focus on resilience thinking, and the use of influence diagrams, causal-loop diagrams, and system archetypes. As a case study, set in the context of the climate-energy-water nexus, we use some of these system concepts and tools to carry out an initial exploration of factors that can affect the resilience of the Australian National Electricity Market. We stress the need for the electricity sector to prepare for the impacts of global change by encouraging innovation and diversity, supporting modularity and redundancy, and embracing the need for a policy making approach that takes account of the dynamics of the wider social-ecological system. Finally, taking a longer term view, we conclude by recommending that policy makers work to reduce reliance on conventional market mechanisms, institute continuing cross-sector dialogue, and promote basic education in system dynamics.},

abstract={The Danube Delta, the second-largest wetland in Europe, provides people with multiple ecosystem services, consisting of drinking water, food, flood protection, nutrient recycling, and recreation, as it is a complex social-ecological system. Nowadays, the area faces heavy depopulation due to its failure in achieving an equilibrium between social, economic, and environmental issues. Therefore, its resurgence is the core element of its sustainable development strategy, and particular sectors such as fishing and aquaculture, agriculture, and tourism national strategies deal individually with essential issues without considering the potential conflicts that may arise from a particular sector's development. This study develops a complex method for decision making concerning the sustainable development of the Danube Delta Biosphere Reserve based on the consultation of both local and higher-level stakeholders in decision making, and the identification of social, economic, and environmental key problems. After their validation by experts, we developed a system dynamics model and ran the identified scenarios together with the stakeholders and recommended policies for the sustainable development of the area. The scenario that combines the transition towards the moderate Intensification of aquaculture with ecological agriculture and slow tourism brings a reduced impact on water quality, but measures to reduce nutrients are still recommended.},

abstract={Bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) management involves ecological and socioeconomic aspects, creating a social-ecological system (SES). Social-ecological thresholds can be identified in the system to assess its specific resil-ience in response to climate stressors. Thus, the aim of this study is to build a dynamic model to assess whether this system is resilient to a particular stressor (water stress). In this study, the SES is considered resilient if the bighorn population is sufficiently large to provide economic revenue to landowners and promote conservation action. We validate and formalize this model by conducting semistructured interviews to Bonfil ejido landowners located in Baja California Sur (BCS), Mexico, and to experts in the field of recreational hunting and wildlife management. To explore the changes in specific resilience in this SES, we conduct simulations to assess the impact of rainfall variability patterns on the system. Our results indicate that rainfall variations with respect to the historical record have the potential to disrupt both the species and the local economy and that the lack of adaptive capacity in both harvest and conservation strategies may affect the dynamics of the whole SES. Finally, this paper explores how adaptive wildlife conservation management strategies can enhance the resilience of both subsystems in this SES.},

month={JUN 30},
abstract={Seagrass meadows are valuable ecosystem service providers that are now being lost globally at an unprecedented rate, with water quality and other localised stressors putting their future viability in doubt. It is therefore critical that we learn more about the interactions between seagrass meadows and future environmental change in the anthropocene. This needs to be with particular reference to the consequences of poor water quality on ecosystem resilience and the effects of change on trophic interactions within the food web. Understanding and predicting the response of seagrass meadows to future environmental change requires an understanding of the natural long-term drivers of change and how these are currently influenced by anthropogenic stress. Conservation management of coastal and marine ecosystems now and in the future requires increased knowledge of how seagrass meadows respond to environmental change, and how they can be managed to be resilient to these changes. Finding solutions to such issues also requires recognising people as part of the social-ecological system. This special issue aims to further enhance this knowledge by bringing together global expertise across this field. The special issues considers issues such as ecosystem service delivery of seagrass meadows, the drivers of long-term seagrass change and the socio-economic consequences of environmental change to seagrass.

title={Trade-offs in adapting to changes in climate, land use, and water availability in California},
journal={ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
year={2023},
volume={28},
number={4},
pages={NA},
month={OCT},
abstract={. Changes in land use and land cover, water systems, and climate are inextricably linked, and their combined stresses have had severe impacts in many regions worldwide. Integrated adaptation planning can support adaptive capacity by helping institutions manage land and water resources at regional to local scales. Linkages between these stressors mean that planners are often faced with potential trade-offs, and how to couple social and environmental sustainability remains a key question. We explore these questions in California's Central Coast, a region that is already experiencing serious water shortages, housing shortages, rapid expansion of perennial agriculture, and severe droughts that are projected to become worse with climate change. Linked models of land use change (the Land Use and Carbon + Water Simulator {[}LUCAS-W]), water resources (LUCAS-W), and climate (the Basin Characterization Model [}BCM]) produced forecasts of exposure to regional changes at 270-m resolution. We worked with regional stakeholders to develop a matrix of nine vulnerability measures that assessed key sensitivities to these changes. Each vulnerability measure combined one of the three exposure projections with spatial datasets representing one of three sensitivity communities (agricultural, domestic, or ecological). We assessed how five scenarios of land-use and water management strategies under consideration by regional planners could provide institutional, top-down adaptive capacity, and whether there were trade-offs in sustainable development goals for these communities. We found that specific land and water management strategies could greatly reduce regional vulnerability, particularly programs to cap water extractions to sustainable levels. The most dramatic trade-off was between the strategy of water demand caps that increased risk of habitat loss and ecosystem preservation that increased water vulnerability. However, trade-offs were usually limited and spatially localized, suggesting local tailoring of the strategies we assessed could reduce them. Trade-offs were more frequent across exposure classes (land use vs. water vs. climate changes) rather than sensitivity classes (agricultural vs. domestic vs. ecological communities), suggesting win-win opportunities for natural resource management. Our vulnerability maps can inform prioritization efforts for local adaptation planning.},

abstract={The Dolores River is fed primarily by snowmelt from the western San Juan Mountains in southwestern Colorado. It travels 241 miles across the Colorado Plateau to its confluence with the Colorado River, near Moab, Utah, a major nature-based tourism destination in the U.S west. Water usage and climate change projections in the Dolores River Watershed, as well as throughout the Colorado River Basin, complicate transboundary planning and management related to vital ecosystem services. As dynamic pressures alter this complex social-ecological system, disparities in resource allocation are magnified. In this study, we leverage reflections from recreation, conservation, and land management stakeholders (n = 18) to understand their perceptions of water allocation within the Dolores River Watershed. We frame this conversation using Rawls's (A theory of justice. Harvard University Press; JSTOR, 1971) theory of justice to explore perceived incompatibilities present within the existing watershed management and discuss recreational and environmental stakeholders' perceptions of the inequitable distribution of resources. A combination of deductive coding processes using Rawls's principles and inductive open coding processes help identify linkages between the Rawlsian framework and interviewees' experiences of the salient political ecologies of the watershed. We conclude by illustrating challenges with the current water regime within the Dolores River Watershed and potential improvements to the distribution of resources through policy and management consistent with Rawls's theory of justice.},

title={Integration of Capacity Factors Analysis Risk Methodology and Ostrom's Social Ecological System Assessment Framework to Assess and Improve Domestic Water Infrastructure in Nalgonda District, Andhra Pradesh, India},

abstract={Over the past 50 years, both financing and socioeconomic considerations in South India have shifted heavily towards improving urban infrastructure, causing rural services to be left behind. A recent report released by WHO and UNICEF states that over 884 million people, 84\% of whom live in rural areas, use ``unimproved water sources{''} for domestic purposes. This paper considers the case study of Nalgonda, a district to the east of Hyderabad, India. Nalgonda struggles with three main issues concerning domestic water: high fluoride levels in groundwater have caused thousands of cases of dental and skeletal fluorosis; second, over two-thirds of Nalgonda does not meet the WHO-requirement of 40 liters per capita daily of domestic water supply; third, poor management and maintenance have increased the risk of failure of existing water infrastructure. The state has been pursuing these issues in conjunction with a multi-district irrigation project that taps the regional Nagarjuna Sagar Dam. Centralized water supply, treatment, and distribution services are appropriate for high population density areas; however, geographical expanse and sparse populations lead to onerous access to improved water sources and inhibit the success of a similar centralized framework in rural areas. This is compounded by a lack of ownership at the habitation and socio-cultural levels. Further, the current water network and its problems-including inconsistent service, corruption, and general distrust of the treated Sagar water-have emboldened wealthier citizens to build private, unregulated groundwater defluoridation plants and commercialize small-scale water businesses. Inequitable services and uncertainty of shared water resources have caused a ``tragedy of the commons,{''} leading to growing disparity and a severely receding water table. This research proposes the Louis-Ostrom Comprehensive Capacity Assessment (LOCCA) tool-an integration of the quantitative Capacity Factors Analysis risk methodology and the qualitative Ostrom's framework for assessing socio-ecological systems (SESs). The new framework is used to provide a sample assessment of the Vaillapally habitation in Narayanpur Mandal, Nalgonda. Preliminary results indicate that the institutional, technical, and socio-cultural capacity factors must progress to meet the policymakers' current projects technical capacity. Alternatively, decentralized systems, such as rainwater harvesting technology, better serve rural areas with low capacity and demand, while increasing collective investment in village-scale systems.},

journal={JOURNAL OF RISK RESEARCH},
year={2016},
volume={19},
number={7, SI},
pages={829-846},
month={NA},
abstract={Transboundary Risk' and its management are widely acknowledged concepts, real-world problems and policy challenges preoccupying the fields of geography, sociology, political science, management and disaster studies. Up to the present, the notion of boundary' in the study and management of transboundary risks principally refers to national borders, whereas other important boundaries, such as the physical boundaries of drainage basins, the boundaries of social-ecological systems (SESs) or the lines separating public from private space, are rarely considered with respect to their penetration by risk dynamics. Resilience has been acknowledged in the case of SESs as an operation appealing to various spatial and temporal scales for access to vital resources. However, the spatio-temporal boundaries which are surpassed or penetrated in the process of transition from one scale to another is an unexplored issue. The authors focus their attention on a specific type of SESs, the social-hydrological systems (SHSs), facing the stress (risk) of water scarcity or drought, and assume that resilience of SHSs may be a process of attraction of water resources from other, probably distant SHSs. This type of resilience which transfers vulnerability might be termed trans-boundary resilience because it necessitates the breaking of boundaries and the spatial transformation of SHSs. This view considers resilience as a transboundary and trans-scalar dynamic process facilitating resource transfer and unveils its spatial dimension as well as its ethical and normative aspects. These assumptions are empirically confirmed in a range of water scarcity and drought problems, which are the following: (a) cities relying on water transfer from distant river basins; (b) agricultural populations and holdings facing drought and relying on a shared aquifer; and (c) arid islands. Whether this type of resilience is valid in other SES cases and other types of risk, is a matter of future research.},

abstract={We look to a particular social-ecological system, the restoration community in Rhode Island, USA and the rivers, wetlands, marshes, and estuaries they work to protect, to draw connections between communication, community involvement, and ecological restoration project success. Offering real-world examples drawn from interviews with 27 local, state, federal, and nonprofit restoration managers, we synthesize the mechanisms that managers found effective to argue that the communication employed by resource managers in each phase of the restoration process, in prioritization, implementation, and monitoring, and for garnering broad-based support, shapes the quality of public engagement in natural resources management, which, in turn, can impact the stakeholder, learning, and ecological success of restoration projects. Despite the possible trade-offs and conflicts between social and ecological outcomes, we suggest that managers need to consider their desired social-ecological outcomes and work from the outset to deliberately design mechanisms for communication and public engagement that weave community stakeholders into all phases of restoration projects in sustained and consequential ways.},

title={Climate resilient management in response to flash droughts in the US Northern Great Plains},

month={FEB},
abstract={The Northern Great Plains (NGP) region plays a very important role in providing water and land resources and other critical ecosystem services to support rural livelihoods. Semi-arid conditions and the tight coupling of livelihood enterprises with ecosystem services increases sensitivity to climate change. The changing climate and social-economic situations across the NGP have further challenged current management practices. Recent climate stresses has indicated that changing seasonality and extreme events (e.g., droughts, floods, ice storms) are impacting ecosystem services and increasing vulnerability to rural livelihoods. In particular, the emergence of rapid on-set of drought has been problematic to resource managers and operators due the shortened period to respond to these drought events. This paper provides a regional example for the North American Great Plains to illustrate how emerging climate impacts affect the ability to respond within the social-ecological system capabilities to manage for these impacts. This paper is a contribution to an international effort, the Global Dryland Ecosystem Programme (Fu et al. this issue), to develop regional research and engagement efforts to further understand the impacts of climate change on ecosystem processes and to enable this knowledge to guide further development of adaptive management options.},

year={2017},
volume={195},

pages={46-55},
month={JUN 15},
abstract={The uncertainty associated with the definition of strategies for climate change adaptation poses a challenge that cannot be faced by science alone. We present a participatory experience where, instead of having science defining solutions and eliciting stakeholders' feedback, local actors actually drove the process. While principles and methods of the approach are easily adaptable to different local contexts, this paper shows the contribution of participatory dynamics to the design of adaptation measures in the biodiversity-rich socio-ecological region surrounding the Donana wetlands (Southern Spain). During the process, stakeholders and scientists collaboratively designed a common scenario for the future in which to define and assess a portfolio of potential adaptation measures, and found a safe, informal space for open dialogue and information exchange. Through this dialogue, points of connection among local actors emerged around the need for more integrated, transparent design of adaptation measures; for strengthening local capacity; and for strategies to diversify economic activities in order to increase the resilience of the region.

journal={LAND},

abstract={We use the hybrid modeling laboratory of the Mediterranean Landscape Dynamics (MedLanD) Project to simulate barranco incision in eastern Spain under different scenarios of natural and human environmental change. We carry out a series of modeling experiments set in the Rio Penaguila valley of northern Alicante Province. The MedLanD Modeling Laboratory (MML) is able to realistically simulate gullying and incision in a multi-dimensional, spatially explicit virtual landscape. We first compare erosion modeled in wooded and denuded landscapes in the absence of human land-use. We then introduce simulated small-holder (e.g., prehistoric Neolithic) farmer/herders in six experiments, by varying community size (small, medium, large) and land management strategy (satisficing and maximizing). We compare the amount and location of erosion under natural and anthropogenic conditions. Natural (e.g., climatically induced) land-cover change produces a distinctly different signature of landscape evolution than does land-cover change produced by agropastoral land-use. Human land-use induces increased coupling between hillslopes and channels, resulting in increased downstream incision.},

abstract={Collaborative natural resource management institutions enable agents with diverse interests to come together to solve complex problems. These actors must overcome a series of collective action problems to create, maintain, and evolve these institutions. In addition to the challenge of heterogeneous actors, these commons social-ecological systems often face internal and external threats or disturbances. The institutional arrangements may be effective with problems that are internal to a social-ecological system - ones that they are designed to handle, but how do these arrangements cope with external disturbances, especially ones caused by large-scale political and economic decisions, events, and processes. Using ethnographic and archival data we conduct an institutional analysis outlining the existing and emerging collaboratives, the important actors, and ongoing efforts to cope with the five major challenges identified by rangeland actors. We trace the evolution of institutions on the western range with a focus on their ability to cope with challenges that are largely within the system - biodiversity, fire, and water management, and those that are driven externally by actors who are largely absent - border militarization and violence and exurbanization.},

journal={ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
year={2019},
volume={24},

pages={NA},
month={SEP},
abstract={We explore how loss of livelihood, loss of ecological function, and loss of group identity are linked in the process of social-ecological change through the narratives of stakeholders associated with the wetland of Xochimilco in Mexico City. Drawing from interviews, focus groups, and participatory workshops with a variety of residents and city administrators, we analyze narratives about what is valued, what is problematized, and what social and ecological relationships appear as critical from the perspective of contemporary residents and officials. Loss is prominent in these narratives, capturing the interdependence of ecology, identity, meaning, and livelihood for the inhabitants. We trace these narratives to the historical roots of center-periphery politics of land and water use, situating the current dynamic context within the social-ecological system's long pathway of change. Diffuse blame for social-ecological change expressed in the narratives appears to inhibit collective action, as does a conflicted history of local response to the city's control of resources. We posit that finding a sustainable pathway forward may depend in part on how residents are able to cognitively or emotionally accommodate landscape change while still enabling the values they have come to associate with the landscape. Such accommodation may entail accepting some degree of loss in system function and structure, but this loss may also provide opportunities for new social-ecological relations that enable the persistence of local identity.},

abstract={Multiple societal challenges such as climate change, water pollution and biodiversity loss require coordinated measures. Thereby the adoption of a nexus perspective is expedient. It acknowledges relationships between natural and social entities, and takes synergies and trade-offs of planned and implemented measures into account. We adopt a nexus perspective to elicit sectoral stakeholders' perceptions on the relationships of the regional nexus entities, relevant measures and their perceived synergies and trade-offs in the semi-arid agricultural production region Seewinkel in East Austria. In a multi-step cognitive mapping approach, consisting of a workshop and semi-structured interviews, we developed an aggregated cognitive map with perceptions of stakeholders from agriculture, water management, nature conservation, tourism, the civil society, renewable energy and hunting. Workshop and interview transcripts were analyzed by means of a qualitative content analysis. Stakeholders agree on the priority of a good quantitative and chemical status of the regional groundwater body and a location-adapted agricultural production. They propose a combination of market-based, legal and technical measures supported by cross-sectoral institutions in responding to regional nexus challenges. Stakeholders perceive divergent synergies and trade-offs. Perceived synergies may provide opportunities, which have not yet been considered for planning of measures. Perceived trade-offs require further examination and cross-sectoral discussion to encourage the implementation of measures. The aggregated cognitive map may improve stakeholders' understanding for nexus relationships and facilitate social learning through viewing the interlinked nexus from distance and different perspectives. This may facilitate cross-sectoral dialogue and enable collective decision making to tackle regional nexus challenges.},

volume={130},

pages={16-24},
month={APR},
abstract={Over the past decade, debates on the governance of food, water, and energy resources (FWE nexus) have increased, provoking new insights into social importance in ecological balance. Policymakers, management professionals, and scholars of the FWE nexus call for new approaches that address ranges of social and ecological impacts of uncoordinated sectoral planning. From a theoretical perspective, social-ecological systems (SES) science offers a balanced approach for improved FWE nexus through consolidating knowledge from a wide range of disciplines and providing the opportunity to adapt to the changing environment. However, although increasingly employed, it has been complicated to empirically monitor and evaluate the dynamic social ecological nexus systems. A framework for translating SES theory into FWE nexus practice is needed. This paper develops an integrated assessment framework of the social-ecological nexus systems governance and presents results from its application to a Dutch smart-eco city. An integrative multi-level analysis scheme is used to analyze intra-and inter-relationships, quantify social and ecological impacts of uncoordinated FWE management, and visualize FWE supply-chain risks posed to cities by the dynamic humans and nature interactions. The evidence-based approach of this study proved advantages of the proposed framework in (i) revealing connections of natural resources and the cultural, regulating, and supporting services of nexus systems, and (ii) making practical recommendations for improved socio-ecologically-balanced nexus interventions. The results can support policymakers and management professionals of the FWE nexus to organize their analytical, diagnostic, and prescriptive capabilities to make development decisions on urban resilience and ecological balance.},

abstract={Mine water drainage interferes with ecosystems of the discharging river, whilst river ecosystem services in return affect the livelihoods and well-being of adjacent communities. In Ha Long, Vietnam, surface coal mining will be closed after 2025 following the national and provincial strategy toward sustainable development. This opens up an opportunity to rehabilitate the associated rivers to increase resilience in the surrounding social-ecological system (SES) heavily affected by water pollution from coal mines. Increasing resilience through rehabilitation is costly and policy makers often lack precise enough information on public benefits to make good decisions. In this study, we apply the concept of SESs to analyze the interrelationship between river ecosystems and human society with its institutions and local governance surrounding the Ha Long coal mining area. Applying a contingent valuation survey with 410 households living near to the mining operations, we assess the public benefits resulting from three different but partly combined projects to increase resilience. Results show that households are significantly willing to contribute to all proposed resilience increasing projects. Factors explaining willingness to pay (WTP) are diverse and are found to be related to common institutions and local governance. Through a comparison of the results for the three projects, we find the presence of embedding effects and identify factors leading to upward biased estimates of WTP. Our study contributes to a better understanding and valuation of public benefits in SES necessary for public policy towards increasing resilience in developing countries.},

abstract={Biophysical and social systems are linked to form social-ecological systems whose sustainability depends on their capacity to absorb uncertainty and cope with disturbances. In this study, we explored the key biophysical and socio-cultural factors underlying ecosystem service supply in two semiarid watersheds of southern Spain. These included variables associated with the role that freshwater flows and biodiversity play in securing the system's capacity to sustain essential ecosystem services and their relationship with social demand for services, local water governance, and land-use intensification. Our results reveal the importance of considering the invisible dimensions of water and biodiversity, i.e. green freshwater flows and trait-based indicators, because of their relevance to the supply of ecosystem services. Furthermore, they uncover the importance of traditional irrigation canals, a local water governance system, in maintaining the ecosystems' capacity to supply services. The study also highlights the complex trade-offs that occur because of the spatial mismatch between ecosystem service supply (upstream) and ecosystem service demand (downstream) in watersheds. Finally, we found that land-use intensification generally resulted in losses of the biophysical factors that underpin the supply of some ecosystem services, increases in social demand for less diversified services, and the abandonment of local governance practices. Attempts to manage social-ecological systems toward sustainability at the local scale should identify the key biophysical and socio-cultural factors that are essential for maintaining ecosystem services and should recognize existing interrelationships between them. Land-use management should also take into account ecosystem service trade-offs and the consequences resulting from land-use intensification.},

volume={9},

pages={NA},
month={JAN 25},
abstract={Rivers are dynamic social-ecological systems that support societies and ecosystems in a multitude of ways, giving rise to a variety of user groups and competing interests. Environmental flows (e-flows) programs developed to protect riverine environments are often conceived by water managers and researchers. This is despite continued calls for increased public participation to include local communities and Indigenous peoples in the development process. Failure to do so undermines social legitimacy and program effectiveness. In this paper, we describe how adaptive management of e-flows allows an opportunity to incorporate a diversity of stakeholder views through an iterative process. However, to achieve this, stakeholder engagement must be intentionally integrated into the adaptive management cycle. Stakeholder engagement in e-flows allows for the creation of a shared understanding of a river and opens collaborative and innovative management strategies that address multiple axes of uncertainty. Here, we describe a holistic framework that unifies current participatory engagement attempts and existing technical methods into a complete strategy. The framework identifies the primary steps in an e-flows adaptive management cycle, describes potential roles of various stakeholders, and proposes potential engagement tools. Restructuring e-flows methods to adequately include stakeholders requires a shift from being driven by deliverables, such as reports and flow recommendations, to focusing on people-oriented outcomes, such as continuous learning and fostering relationships. While our work has been placed in the context of e-flows, the intentional integration of stakeholder engagement in adaptive management is pertinent to natural resources management generally.},

title={Compelling collective action: Does a shared pollution cap incentivize farmer cooperation to restore water quality?},

volume={13},
number={1, SI},
pages={378-399},
month={NA},
abstract={Decades of voluntary efforts to reduce agricultural nonpoint source pollution have been ineffective at protecting water quality worldwide. While farmer collective action is needed to deal with the geographical extent of diffuse pollution from nutrient runoff, theoretical expectations from commons governance research predicts that farmers will not protect water quality since they have few incentives to do so. These different factors indicate that compulsory approaches are needed. However, the commons literature has tended to overlook the constructive roles that government regulation can play. Research on why farmers adopt on-farm conservation measures similarly has failed to explore farmer cooperation, instead focusing mainly on financial motivations of farmers. Yet, some adoption research indicates that social norms are essential factors shaping (non) adoption, but which are largely overlooked by existing agri-environmental policies. This study examines the important gap of how government regulations can incentivise farmer-cooperation to improve water quality. I focus on a case study of the Florida Everglades, where farmers face joint liability under a phosphorus pollution cap and which has resulted in improvements in water quality over the past 20 years. Farms' drainage disrupts the oligotrophic conditions of the Florida Everglades, but water quality has steadily improved since regulations began in 1994. However, the regulations set compliance jointly for farmers, devolving responsibility to ensure sufficient adoption of conservation practices and deal with free riding. While state monitoring shows that collectively farms have improved water quality, we do not know whether participation is widespread or concentrated among a few large farms. This study provides the first analysis of farm-level water quality outcomes for this area and how judicial, legislative, and local institutions interact to encourage farmer cooperation. Results show that a large majority of farms have improved their water quality, demonstrating that collective action has been a key element in the outcome. At the same time, poor-performing farms reveal the shortcomings of joint compliance. I end by discussing the implications of how individual and collective requirements can provide farmers with valuable information while also drawing on farmer social dynamics to encourage greater participation.},

journal={ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
year={2020},
volume={25},
number={4},
pages={NA},
month={DEC},
abstract={Developing countries frequently find their poverty reduction initiatives to be at odds with promotion of sustainable practices. In India too, agricultural intensification through horticulture cultivation is an important government strategy to raise farm incomes but its mechanisms and implications have not been critically analyzed. Our objective is to characterize this intensification and explore conditions under which its goals may be achieved while ensuring equity in access to ecological services and resilience of the social-ecological system (SES). Our focal SES is the water-constrained farm system of western India that overlays shallow hard-rock aquifers common to the Indian peninsula. We document farm decisions and coping strategies of 121 farmers over two consecutive years: a drought year and a good rainfall year. We find that farmers are driven to high-value horticulture to remain economically viable in the face of increasing social-ecological vulnerability due to factors such as monsoon variability, high groundwater development, and uncertainty in irrigation access. Through systems modeling, we uncover the feedback loops that propagate risk. Risk in access to water, in part due to monsoon dry spells, starts a cycle of expensive investments often requiring large loans to assure access and a simultaneous move to horticulture in response to the elevated cost of water. This mitigates risk for the farmer in the short run but, in the absence of regulation and complete information about the common groundwater pool, leads to competitive investments, driving the regime to greater uncertainty levels for the entire community. This vicious cycle of investment and intensification escalates risk, leading to frequent crop failure, farmer indebtedness, and the tragedy of the commons. Government interventions further catalyze this. We propose alternate leverage points to enhance social comprehension of risk and facilitate collective action so as to negotiate room for human needs while remaining within biophysical boundaries.},

abstract={Policy-making in social-ecological systems increasingly looks to iterative, evolutionary approaches that can address the inherent complexity of interactions between human wellbeing, provision of goods, and the maintenance of ecosystem services. Here, we show how the analysis of available time-series in tropical delta regions over past decades can provide important insight into the social-ecological system dynamics in deltaic regions. The paper provides an exploratory analysis of the recent changes that have occurred in the major elements of three tropical deltaic social-ecological systems, such as demography, economy, health, climate, food, and water. Time-series data from official statistics, monitoring programmes, and Earth observation data are analysed to explore possible trends, slow and fast variables, and observed drivers of change in the Amazon, Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna and Mekong deltas. In the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna delta zone, increasing gross domestic product and per capita income levels since the 1980s mirror rising levels of food and inland fish production. In contrast, non-food ecosystem services, such as water availability, water quality, and land stability appear to be deteriorating. In the Amazon delta, natural and anthropogenic perturbations are continuously degrading key ecosystem services, such as carbon storage in biomass and soils, the regulation of water balance, and the modulation of regional climate patterns. In the Mekong delta, rapid economic development, changing land-use practices, and salinity intrusion are progressively putting more pressure on the delivery of important provisioning services, such as rice and inland aquaculture production, which are key sources of staple food, farm incomes, and export revenue. Observed changes in many key indicators of ecosystem services point to a changing dynamic state and increased probability of systemic threshold transformations in the near future.},

abstract={Hydrological changes due to climate change will impact the sustainability of social-ecological systems (SES). It is essential to develop methodologies, capable of addressing economic as well as the environmental aspects, to take care of the water-associated system through improving the system adaptive capacity, particularly in arid and semi-arid areas. Through the application of the Post-Modern Portfolio Theory (PMPT), we propose a new approach to water allocation problem in the face of climate change, as a case of Lake Tashk-Bakhtegan basin, Southern Iran. The economic model based on PMPT is adapted for designing water allocation schemes to maximize local economic return, minimize its risk and minimize the Gini coefficient indicative of social inequities. The climatic variables were generated by three Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Models. The temperature and precipitation will increase and decrease by about +2.4\% and -10\% on average in the future compared to those in the historical period, respectively. In order to identify hydrological and socio-economic implications of climate change in the basin, an integrated system dynamic model was developed. Finally, the decision space of equally effective solutions has been determined in the form of Pareto points at the efficient portfolio plane. The findings showed a decrease in the economic return (on average by 5.7\% in the both RCPs) and the ratio of employment to unemployment (average 10\% in most of sub-basin), owing to the reduction of water resources, especially in agriculture. Base on Portfolio results, the ratio of economic return to risk doubled and tripled in optimized condition compared to the normal condition in the future. The efficient plane of the portfolio can be used to allocate water to economic activities according to a risk-taking attitude of a decision-maker. Following the model results, services and industrial sectors would need to be developed in order to sustain local water resources with possible additional allocations for environmental requirements, with simultaneous improvement of economic return on water resources.

abstract={The world's population is growing constantly and, more importantly, the need for raw materials and food products is growing quickly, as a result of the western development model. The energy-consuming (energivorous) and consumerist nature of this model is being consolidated globally, ignoring both the issue of resource limitations, and the medium-long term environmental consequences (e.g. climate change, water pollution). This development model, in order to maintain its internal integrity and further develop (often at increasing rates of growth), needs to import energy and materials from the external environment and to produce waste and disorder (entropy) in an inexorable slide toward thermodynamic equilibrium. Sustainable development should focus on contrasting these processes as far as possible, and on developing suitable planning praxes. This paper aims to show how to achieve sustainable land-use through local resource evaluation, overturning the ``linear{''} logic of acquisition-consumption-disposal of wastes, in search of circular processes, capable of reducing entropy growth in a social-ecological system. An analysis of the exergetic availabilities of the landscape mosaic demonstrates great potential for exploiting energy supplies from local and renewable sources, thus lessening the system's overall impact on the global environment.},

month={OCT},
abstract={Horses have been associated with human societies for millennia, and for many have come to symbolize wildness, power, resilience, and freedom. Although equids were extirpated from North America 10,000-12,000 years ago, descendants of domestic horses now roam freely in the USA and 17 other countries across six continents. In landscape-scale and experimental investigations, free-roaming horses (Equus caballus) have been shown to induce numerous alterations to native-ecosystem components and processes through influences on soil, water, plants, and other aspects of biodiversity. However, we argue that the management of free-roaming horses both in the U.S. and globally has been complicated by ``socio-ecological mismatches.{''} Such mismatches arise from an inability to reconcile conflicting processes and functions in a social-ecological system, often reflecting differences in the spatio-temporal scales at which diverse components operate. Here, we describe three types of mismatches, and illustrate how the ecological dynamics of aridlands generally fit poorly with existing approaches to horse management and policy. Such mismatches complicate cost-effective management of free-roaming horses and the ecosystems they inhabit, and reduce the palette of potential solutions.},

abstract={Understanding how landholders relate to the land and water they manage is crucial to sustainable natural resource management policy and practice. This study focuses on the relationship that rural landholders, both producers and rural lifestylers, have with their land and waterways, to provide insight into a social-ecological dynamic that contributes to social resilience. Mixed qualitative methods of semi structured interviews and photovoice are used to examine stewardship; place attachment and constituent components of affective, functional and cognitive connection; as well as sense of community, through a case study in the Mary River valley in South-east Queensland Australia. Powerful visual images from participant-derived photos illustrate rural landholders' views of the interwined connections of landscapes and communities and their `love of the land'. The study thus expands the breadth of methods used in investigating place attachment. It contributes to the theoretical understanding of how the integrated nature of stewardship, place and community build and maintain social resilience. Understanding landholder relationships and motivations as part of a social-ecological system can enable better targeting of land management support. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Blue spaces such as rivers provide many ecosystem services (ES), including freshwater for consumption, habitat, water quality regulation, and multiple cultural amenities. While many studies have quantified the biophysical supply of ES provided by rivers, fewer have explored the social demand for ES due to the considerable effort involved in collecting these data. The San Marcos River (SMR) and the Texas State University (TXST) students that use this blue space represent a dynamic social-ecological system (SES) where nature experiences shape student values of the system. In this study, we survey the TXST student population about their use, value, and perception of the SMR, a highly used river of which headwaters originate on and flow through campus. From our extensive survey of these students, we find that educational and life experiences matter. Overall, we find that student exposure to the SMR in space, time, and experience does have measurable effects on their use, value, and perception of ES. This SES study demonstrates the importance of life experiences, place-based knowledge, and experiential learning in influencing one's well-being and value of natural environments.},

abstract={Recent years have seen an explosion of interest in the resource nexus. This has created the co-existence of different understandings and uses of the concept. In this regard, experiences in the EU H2020 project `Moving towards adaptive governance in complexity: Informing nexus security' are consistent with findings reported in the literature: (i) The inconvenient message of the nexus is difficult to get across, it being incompatible with the currently dominant rosy narratives about sustainability. Indeed, from a historic perspective, the nexus can be seen as a revival of the ideological fight between cornucopians and neo-Malthusians; (ii) Silo structures in existing institutions are a problem for the governance of the nexus, and so is the resulting reductionist strategy of addressing and fixing one issue at the time; (iii) Scientific inquiry is currently not providing the quality inputs needed for a meaningful discussion of the resource nexus. Entanglement of resource flows is rooted in the complex metabolic pattern of social-ecological systems, the analysis of which requires a complex systems approach and relational analysis. Contemporary reductionist models simply make the nexus invisible to the analyst.},

abstract={The Brazilian Amazon faces three dominant governance challenges that have become increasingly interconnected over time and now affect each other: managing agricultural expansion, reducing deforestation, and mitigating urban floods. This region exemplifies that the governance of one social-ecological system (SES) in the Anthropocene can no longer be thought of in isolation of others because, together, they form a complex network of flows and spillovers to manage. Studying the interconnection of different decision-making areas, however, calls for an intertemporal examination of governance that integrates different methodological approaches. We use the Network of Adjacent Action Situations (NAS), Combined IAD-SES (CIS) framework, and the telecoupling framework to study these three interrelated processes in the Amazon. Employing mixed-methods research, including fieldwork covering each of these processes, we demonstrate how the governance of multiple SESs represents an intertemporal governance challenge. Our paper contributes to the SES governance and NAS literature by linking governance issues generally looked at separately and offering an understanding of the governance connections between telecoupled processes. Beyond its contribution to Brazilian Amazon governance, this paper offers an integrated framework that may be useful to study the interconnection of governance of NAS in other places.},

abstract={Urban growth has impacted natural ecosystems such as wetlands. This situation destabilizes the beneficial contributions of nature, generating a socioeconomic effect. There is a need to quantify the benefits of wetlands in developing countries and urban areas, where the growth of cities is fastest. This is the first valuation study of urban and peri-urban wetlands in Colombia. The methodology includes a benefit transfer (BT) method with a geographical information system (GIS) and an exploratory governance analysis. Because there are few studies on the economic valuation of urban wetlands in Latin America, we present a methodology of interest, which can be easily replicated in other cities of this subcontinent. Based on an economic approach, our results find that 76\% of the total value of wetlands is provided by ecosystem services (ES) of existence and legacy value, followed by maintenance of the life cycle of migratory species and water supply. Urban areas are identified where users benefit more than areas where the population exerts greater pressure on wetlands. Weak governance is due to the disarticulation between regulation, land-use planning, and the social-ecological system. This research contributes to urban wetland management policies, as well as to sustainable solutions in cities.},

abstract={In recent years more recognition is given to the benefits and risks of private smallholder irrigation development across sub-Saharan Africa. It is acknowledged for its capacity to adapt to local circumstances and challenges. This study assesses the heterogeneous character of private smallholder irrigation in the challenging environment of southern arid Zimbabwe, where family farms operate along sand river aquifers, forming a reliable natural storage of shallow groundwater. It investigates the drivers, characteristics, obstacles and adaptive capacity of this yet undocumented form of private irrigation in a historically marginalised area, and in particular also the discontinuation of these informal irrigation ventures. The research combines results from analysing satellite images, and quantitative and qualitative field work, whereby a social-ecological system perspective is applied. This form of private smallholder irrigation is distinct from most other documented cases in sub-Saharan Africa. First, because of the unique interrelation between the water source, technology need and fuel-dependency in an economically marginalised area. Second, because drivers for the emergence of private smallholder irrigation are not market-based but crisis-driven; recurrent droughts and frequent dry-spells, failure of collectively-managed irrigation schemes, and persistent economic instability. As a result, many families cease operations because they reach the limits of their adaptive capacity or they migrate. Those who succeed, manage to benefit from the abundance of water stored in sand rivers, the mobilisation of knowledge and cash through rural networks, and the existence of cross-border trade opportunities. However, they hardly ever pass the level of subsistence in an area where stable markets are absent. Organising potential support to private smallholder irrigation remains a challenging and disputable avenue as this might undermine its independent and adaptive nature.},

title={The production of contested landscapes: Enclosing the pastoral commons in Niger},
journal={JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES},

volume={51},
number={NA},
pages={125-140},
month={APR},
abstract={Divergent adaptation to climate variability produces unequal adaptive capacities between user groups and contributes to a contested landscape. This article examines divergent adaptations in the context of land tenure shifts in the pastoral zone of Niger. The management of the pastoral commons is shifting from a commonly-shared to private regime as former pastoralists take up new livelihoods, such as irrigated gardening. A method combining political ecology and remote sensing is used to study social ecological system (SES) dynamics in order to demonstrate the relationship between divergent adaptation, water-based conflict, land tenure shifts and land use/land cover change. Examining pastoral and agro-pastoral users' historical perceptions of land use and tenure change, results indicate that disputes over the access to and use of commonly shared natural resources are linked to increasing enclosures of ephemeral and permanent lakes in the pastoral zone of Niger. Remote sensing-derived information is used to identify and quantify the area and volume of enclosures around commonly shared water sources in the northern pastoral zone of Niger from 2003 to 2013. The study identifies the government-supported development of irrigated gardens in the pastoral zone as a divergent adaptation with its related conflict dynamics between user groups and highlights the land tenure shifts from a commonly to a privately managed regime. The findings have broader implications for the wider Sahel and provide recommendations as to how adaptation programs could be better designed and implemented in the pastoral system.

abstract={Scenario analysis can be a useful tool to explore paths to a desirable future. This paper is a `future history' describing the how stakeholders in the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River basin of North America rallied to confront regional challenges 50 years into the future (2013-2063). This future scenario was developed by considering how nine drivers of change (aquatic invasive species; biological and chemical contaminants; climate change; demographics and societal values; economy; energy; governance and geopolitics; water quantity; and technology) might impact the region. This ``thriving and prosperous{''} scenario envisions that in the beginning, Great Lakes residents, scientists, and policymakers saw ``the writing on the wall,{''} recognizing that past approaches to environmental policy failed to provide long-term environmental, social, and economic prosperity. In response, policymakers in the Great Lakes region began formulating and implementing new policies, but actions were scattered across the region and uncoordinated across geopolitical boundaries. Recognizing the need to coordinate their efforts, Great Lakes stakeholders began ``marching in step{''} by agreeing on a common set of guiding principles for future policy actions. Building on this momentum, Great Lakes policymakers implemented a suite of regulations and initiatives that recognized the Great Lakes region as a complex social-ecological system. Between 2053 and 2063, the region began to reap the benefits of coordinated policy action. By 2063, the Great Lakes region showed how a long-term commitment to improving the environment can sustain a thriving and prosperous ecosystem and economy.

abstract={In this article we summarize histories of nonlinear, complex interactions among societal, legal, and ecosystem dynamics in six North American water basins, as they respond to changing climate. These case studies were chosen to explore the conditions for emergence of adaptive governance in heavily regulated and developed social-ecological systems nested within a hierarchical governmental system. We summarize resilience assessments conducted in each system to provide a synthesis and reference by the other articles in this special feature. We also present a general framework used to evaluate the interactions between society and ecosystem regimes and the governance regimes chosen to mediate those interactions. The case studies show different ways that adaptive governance may be triggered, facilitated, or constrained by ecological and/or legal processes. The resilience assessments indicate that complex interactions among the governance and ecosystem components of these systems can produce different trajectories, which include patterns of (a) development and stabilization, (b) cycles of crisis and recovery, which includes lurches in adaptation and learning, and (3) periods of innovation, novelty, and transformation. Exploration of cross scale (Panarchy) interactions among levels and sectors of government and society illustrate that they may constrain development trajectories, but may also provide stability during crisis or innovation at smaller scales; create crises, but may also facilitate recovery; and constrain system transformation, but may also provide windows of opportunity in which transformation, and the resources to accomplish it, may occur. The framework is the starting point for our exploration of how law might play a role in enhancing the capacity of social-ecological systems to adapt to climate change.},

abstract={This paper revisits David Pimentel's work on input-output analysis of agricultural production systems with the objective of demonstrating its (continued) relevance for the analysis of complex environmental issues. It is shown that his unique accounting procedure is grounded in complexity theory and that it effectively links expected relations over primary inputs and outputs exchanged with the ecosphere and secondary inputs and outputs exchanged with the anthroposphere (including labor). New conceptual building blocks are introduced to demonstrate that Pimentel's analysis can be extended across different hierarchical levels (crop typologies, commodity supply systems, agricultural regions, etc.) and dimensions of analysis to obtain a formal representation of the metabolic pattern of social-ecological systems. These concepts include: (i) state-pressure relation (extensive properties); (ii) flow-fund ratios (intensive properties), i.e., qualitative benchmarks to define typologies of agricultural production in relation to both the socioeconomic process (e.g., land productivity, labor productivity) and the environmental pressure exerted on the environment (e.g., water consumption, GHG emission and pesticide load per hectare); and (iii) relational analysis to scale up the analysis to higher hierarchical levels so as to acquire policy relevance. Examples of the pertinence of this formalization are illustrated using Pimentel's original data on grain cultivation in the USA. It is concluded that Pimentel's work has set an example for a holistic approach to complex environmental problems and has paved the way for a more general conceptualization of social-ecological systems as metabolic systems.},

funding_text={I had the opportunity and honor to work closely with David Pimentel for more than a decade in the late eighties and the nineties. Undoubtedly, David's intuition for environmental accounting, his enthusiasm for research and teaching, and his active engagement with emerging environmental concerns shaped my research career. Only now, after two decades of struggling with narrow-minded environmental researchers and policymakers, am I able to fully appreciate the extent and relevance of David's work. His innate holistic and practical view of social-ecological systems permitted him to adopt a highly relevant system of quantitative characterization without pre-analytical conceptualization or formalizations. Whereas David dedicated his research career to exposing environmental concerns with numbers, I have spent most of mine framing David's insights in theoretical and conceptual terms thereby heavily drawing on complexity theory. In this way, I hope to have contributed to the due recognition of his work. This article builds on the work performed in the Horizon 2020 project ``Moving Towards Adaptive Governance in Complexity: Informing Nexus Security{''} (MAGIC). It could not possibly exist without the efforts and insights of the MAGIC consortium, and notably that of the UAB team. MAGIC was funded by the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under Grant Agreement No. 689669. I also wish to acknowledge financial support by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation (MICINN) through the ``Maria de Maeztu{''} program for Units of Excellence (CEX2019-000940-M).

abstract={Most assessments of resilience have been focused on local conditions. Studies focused on the relationship between humanity and environmental degradation are rare, and are rarely comprehensive. We investigated multiple social-ecological factors for 100 countries around the globe in relation to the percentage of invasions and extinctions within each country. These 100 countries contain approximately 87\% of the world's population, produce 43\% of the world's per capita gross domestic product (GDP), and take up 74\% of the earth's total land area. We used an information theoretic approach to determine which models were most supported by our data, utilizing an a priori set of plausible models that included a combination of 15 social-ecological variables, each social-ecological factor by itself, and selected social-ecological factors grouped into three broad classes. These variables were per capita GDP, export-import ratio, tourism, undernourishment, energy efficiency, agricultural intensity, rainfall, water stress, wilderness protection, total biodiversity, life expectancy, adult literacy, pesticide regulation, political stability, and female participation in government. Our results indicate that as total biodiversity and total land area increase, the percentage of endangered birds also increases. As the independent variables (agricultural intensity, rainfall, water stress, and total biodiversity) in the ecological class model increase, the percentage of endangered mammals in a country increases. The percentage of invasive birds and mammals in a country increases as per capita GDP increases. As life expectancy increases, the percentage of invasive and endangered birds and mammals increases. Although our analysis does not determine mechanisms, the patterns observed in this study provide insight into the dynamics of a complex, global, social-ecological system.},

abstract={Lake ecosystems are complex social-ecological systems facing ecological, economic, and social challenges influenced by natural and social factors. The Dal Lake is an urban lake in the Kashmir Himalaya that serves as a prime example of such a complex system, highlighting the intricate connections between the socio-economic activities and the natural environment. Using a case study of the Dal Lake, this study employs remote sensing tools, ecological and socio-economic data, along with stakeholder perceptions, to evaluate the driving forces, pressures, and potential strategies for enhancing the lake's social-ecological resilience. The study highlights the significant challenges faced by the Dal Lake social-ecological system in its ecological, economic, social, and cultural domains, rendering it vulnerable to current and future disruptions. Population expansion, rapid urbanization, pollution, agriculture expansion, invasive species, settlements, and inadequate management have disrupted the ecological integrity and the socio-economic dynamics of the lake. To enhance social-ecological resilience, adaptive management of the lake ecosystem is recommended as a crucial tool for sustainable management. The multidisciplinary approach employed in this study provides an integrated understanding of the state, challenges, and opportunities for developing social-ecological resilience in the Dal Lake, enabling informed decision-making for its future restoration and sustainable management.},

year={2018},

number={4},
pages={NA},
month={DEC},
abstract={Innovative, pragmatic approaches are needed to support sustainable livelihoods and landscape management in complex social-ecological systems (CSES) such as river catchments. In the Tsitsa River Catchment, South Africa, researchers and natural resource managers have come together to apply such innovative approaches. Since CSES are characterised by uncertainty and surprise, understanding and managing them requires a commitment to reflexive praxis and transdisciplinarity. Accordingly, we facilitated a collective reflection and learning process in the project team to deepen our understanding of praxis in CSES. Our findings indicate that CSES thinking created an enabling framing. However, building new linkages among diverse actors to put CSES thinking into practice is challenging, since it requires the development of novel working relationships. Existing institutional structures, power dynamics, and ways of working impose significant constraints. A deeper critical realist analysis of our findings revealed a metaphor which explains why this work is challenging. In this metaphor, the Tsitsa Project team is navigating a bumpy terrain of dialectic tensions. These are tensions for example between natural science and social science, and between science and indigenous knowledge. Based on this metaphor, we suggest an expanding role for scientists and managers, and recommend transformative social learning processes to support teams navigating such bumpy terrains.},

abstract={Urban growth in low- and middle-income countries has intensified the need to expand sanitation infrastructure, especially in informal settlements. Sanitation approaches for these settings remain understudied, particularly regarding multidimensional social-ecological outcomes. Guided by a conceptual framework (developed in parallel with this study) re-envisioning sanitation as a human-derived resource system, here we characterize existing and alternative sanitation scenarios in an informal settlement in Kampala, Uganda. Combining two core research approaches (household survey analysis, process modeling), we elucidate factors associated with user satisfaction and evaluate each scenario's resource recovery potential, economic implications, and environmental impacts. We find that existing user satisfaction is associated with factors including cleaning frequency, sharing, and type of toilets, and we demonstrate that alternative sanitation systems may offer multidimensional improvements over existing latrines, drying beds, and lagoons. Transitioning to anaerobic treatment could recover energy while reducing overall net costs by 26-65\% and greenhouse gas emissions by 38-59\%. Alternatively, replacing pit latrines with container-based facilities greatly improves recovery potential in most cases (e.g., a 2- to 4-fold increase for nitrogen) and reduces emissions by 46-79\%, although costs increase. Overall, this work illustrates how our conceptual framework can guide empirical research, offering insight into sanitation for informal settlements and more sustainable resource systems.},

abstract={Valuation of cultural ecosystem services (CES) remains one of the most difficult and least accomplished tasks in ecosystem services research. In this study the Contingent Valuation Method with the double bounded dichotomous choice format was used to elicit WTP for agricultural heritage (AH) conservation, which was modeled using a Bivariate Probit specification. The hypothesis tested was that WTP decreased with distance from the site of provision of AH. Results show no significant differences in WTP across locations with equivalent means of US\$50.8, US\$36.2 and US\$52.5 for Chiloe (site of AH provision), Valdivia (at 379 km from Chiloe), and Santiago (at 1198 km from Chiloe), respectively, suggesting that non-use values can be equally important for local as well as distant populations, particularly when the CES can be ascribed to emblematic cultural landscapes such as Chiloe. Aggregation of individual WTP demonstrates the importance of AH as a highly valued CES and sustains the recent designation of Chiloe as a Global Importance Agricultural Heritage System (GIAHS) pilot site The study might prompt authorities to generate the proper incentives to move from just a GIAHS label to a real conservation initiative in Chiloe Island.

abstract={Riverscapes are coupled social-ecological systems (SESs), in which the differences between the scales and functioning of interacting social and ecological components ( ``mismatch{''}) impose challenges for global arid basin sustainability. Here, we defined riverscape SESs as networks of connected ecological and social components (nodes) to disentangle the structure and effects of SESs in Heihe River Basin (HRB) in arid regions of northwest China. Results showed the ecological network in HRB has low network density and high vertex strength. Heihe River Basin Bureau, as an emerging bridging organization, changed the SES structure and increased the matching degree of SES from 0.33 to 0.53, which has caused an obvious improvement in the downstream ecology. However, the characteristics of the ecological network demonstrated that cross-boundary management actions restricted to only the river would exacerbate local environmental pressures, such as the continued decline of groundwater in midstream regions and the potential appropriation of water for ecology by the expanding farmland in the downstream region. Our study demonstrated that network analysis could be one promising direction to untangle the complex SES and understand the relationship between SES structure and outcomes. We suggest comanaging the cross-boundary river and lands to further match the SES for basin sustainability.},

abstract={This study explores the application of a civic perception analysis in the context of stream restoration as a social-ecological system (SES). Analysing such a SES is useful for understanding correlations between civic interests and environmental conditions in river restoration. An analytic hierarchy process (AHP) analysis was used to quantify the demand for restoration objectives. Additionally, an image-based survey was used to precisely capture residents' perceptions of urban stream restoration by comparing aesthetic images, hydrologic functions, and environmental quality. Based on the AHP results, a hierarchical multiple regression was derived. A total of 181 participants responded to our survey, and the results were summarized by each subwatershed in the An'Yang watershed. The results demonstrated that the perceptions of residents who live in various environmental and regional conditions may manifoldly reflect their personal visual and aesthetic preferences by subwatershed. The upstream subwatershed values (SW1 = 7.86 and SW2 = 7.39) were higher than those in the downstream areas (SW5 = 5.28 and SW6 = 5.15). Consequently, this hierarchical multilevel model showed that individual environmental perception was highly associated with visual preference regarding stream restoration at the subwatershed level (p < 0.001). Urban environmental and spatial planners could use such information when restoring and designing waterfront spaces.},

abstract={Integrating social and ecological aspects of bivalve aquaculture in research and management processes can improve understanding of the system as a whole, and facilitate management decision-making. We created social-ecological conceptual models of Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas), Manila clam (Venerupis philippinarum), and Pacific geoduck (Panopea generosa) aquaculture in a USA estuary, which were the basis of qualitative network analysis to compare: (i) social-ecological models versus truncated ecological- and social- only models, and (ii) two geoduck models representing different stakeholder groups' perspectives on nature-based recreation and environmental stewardship. The social-ecological models predicted different results compared to individual social or ecological models, including for abundance of invertebrates, eelgrass, and marine water quality. The two alternative geoduck models predicted outcomes that varied across multiple social-ecological variables, including the availability of local harvestable food, sense of place, and abundance of invertebrates in structured habitat. Results demonstrate the interconnectedness of the social and ecological components of the aquaculture system, and how predicted outcomes can vary depending on their inclusion in the model. This study also demonstrates the value in considering a suite of models that represents a range of group perspectives to identify areas of conflict and agreement, and to recognize bias inherent in the models.},

abstract={Cruise-ship tourism is one of the fastest growing industry sectors, with itineraries that regularly visit marine parks and protected areas. UNESCO Marine World Heritage (MWH) Sites feature some of the world's most exceptional ecosystems, resulting in some cruise lines targeting these sites. To understand the extent of cruise ship visitation and determine perceptions of cruise ship sustainability within and across environmental, economic, and sociocultural dimensions, we conducted an online survey of 45 (out of 50) sites. The survey included responses about the characteristics of cruise ship visitation, strategies for sustainably managing ships, and ideas for encouraging sustainable practices. Among the 45 respondents, 30 (67\%) indicated that their MWH site hosts cruise ships or cruise ship passengers, and 25 sites have cruise ships that enter the protected area marine waters. Most sites (62\%) indicated an increase in cruise visitation over the last three years. While most sites regulate ballast water (73\%) and wastewater (73\%) discharge, common concerns focused on ship air emissions and wildlife interactions. Lack of funds generated by cruise ships toward community infrastructure was noted. MWH site managers expressed interest in developing site networks to facilitate sharing of ideas as a first step for increasing sustainability across all sites.},

abstract={Improved stormwater management for the protection of water resources requires bottom-up stewardship from landowners, including adoption of Green Stormwater Infrastructure (GSI). We use a statewide survey of Vermont paired with a cross-scale and spatial analysis to evaluate the influence of interacting spatial, social, and physical factors on residential intention to adopt GSI across a complex social-ecological landscape. Specifically, we focus on how three GSI practices, ({''}rain garden (bio retention),{''} ``infiltration trenches,{''} and ``actively divert roof runoff to a rain barrel/lawn/garden instead of the street/sewer{''}) vary with barriers to adoption, and household attributes across stormwater contexts from the household to watershed scale. Private landowners, who may be motivated more by on-site and neighborhood stormwater problems, may gravitate toward practices like infiltration trenches compared with practices (e.g., rain gardens) perceived to serve stormwater function over larger areas. Diversion of roof runoff was found to be more likely to be a part of a larger assembly of green behaviors. Improved stormwater management outcomes at the watershed, town, neighborhood, and household levels depend on adaptive approaches and adjusting strategies along the rural-urban gradient, across the biophysical landscape, and according to varying norms and institutional arrangements.},

abstract={Ecosystem services (ES) research has rapidly gained momentum in environmental policy and practice. However, qualitative socio-cultural approaches are still limited, and therefore, ES important for people, are currently. not commonly captured. We performed 34 face-to-face semi-structured interviews to describe stakeholders' appreciation of ES from dehesa landscapes in northern Extremadura, Spain. A total of 45 ES were mentioned, and compared among different sectors and levels of governance. At the local level, people appreciated especially provisioning and cultural services. In contrast, regional level respondents showed more appreciation for regulating and supporting services, which included biodiversity conservation and climate regulation. Private and public sector respondents appreciated provisioning services more, whereas the civil sector mentioned supporting and regulating services more. For instance, water regulation was only mentioned by civil and public sector respondents, while genetic resource preservation was only expressed by the private sector. All sectors noted cultural services as key ES. We discuss most mentioned ES by respondents, the co-production nature of ES in wood-pastures, as well as cultural services as key ES of dehesas in coupled social-ecological systems. We conclude with policy recommendations drawn from the insights of this study. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={This chapter synthesizes the research needs presented in the book and proposes actions for addressing them. It highlights the socioeconomic and biophysical characteristics, development, production and consumption patterns, challenges and threats and management approaches that were discussed in the preceding chapters and discusses the priorities for future Lake Tana basin research that were raised. The analysis shows that the basin has many unique features, and great potential for sustainable development, especially in water resources. The lake and basin provide multiple benefits to the local community, the region and downstream riparian countries. Many of the problematic trends in the region result from an imbalance between resource production and consumption patterns, and limited or poorly implemented conservation measures. The many and complex challenges and threats in the basin are caused, in part, by the lack of an integrated basin plan and poor collaborative mechanisms to share data and find sustainable solutions. The available data and information about the basin is limited. It is not well-organized, accessible, or used well for the basin's resource management. The identification of major research gaps and priorities for future research highlighted in this book, as well as the systems framework for integration and collaboration, provide a basis for further research and policy decisions to promote sustainability in the region.},

abstract={Institutional crafting requires purposeful communication between features of social and ecological systems. This paper evaluates the application of a specific research tool - Ostrom's social-ecological systems framework (SESF), which seeks to provide a basis for institutional crafting in the context of social-ecological systems (SES). We evaluate the application of the framework to empirical analysis against the background of some of its own ambitions and a set of conventional criteria for evaluating research. We found 20 publications that have applied the SESF. The SESF proved useful in articles that use it for explanation, though they often played down the question of how they selected explanatory variables. Across cases, application of the SESF fared poorly in terms of consistency of use and measurement of categories. Moreover, generalization on an analytical level is similarly compromised by lack of confidence among authors concerning how to apply the set-theoretic principles that underlie the nested structure of the framework. In sum, much work remains in order to realize the ambitions for research that the SESF has laid out and to fully use its associated, path-breaking, interdisciplinary, and policy-relevant innovations. Notwithstanding these critical remarks, recent work in this area seems highly promising, not least for policy practice and institutional crafting. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Addressing urban challenges with nature-based approaches can improve and protect ecosystem services. Yet, urban planning has not efficiently integrated such approaches to manage land use. This paper examines interactions between human and natural systems that result in ecosystem services and changes in land use and land cover in urban areas. It develops a social-ecological model for land use and land cover change, and for ecosystems services that integrates nature-based solutions in urban planning. The model treats spatial variations in ecosystems services as both drivers and consequences of human decision-making in choosing commercial and residential locations that drive land use and land cover change. We tested the social-ecological model in Stockholm County, Sweden, on a 30 x 30 m grid. Results show that accessibility in ecosystem services drives urban residential and commercial development, characterized by non-linearity. Areas around existing urban centers show high accessibility in ecosystem services and high development probabilities, whereas smaller population centers in large areas enjoy high accessibility to ecosystem services and low urban development probabilities. Model results suggest place-specific nature-based strategies for addressing the heterogeneous spatial relationships between ecosystem services and urban development. (C) 2021 The Author(s).

title={Evaluation of a new method for assessing resilience in urban aquatic social-ecological systems},
journal={ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
year={2017},
volume={22},
number={4},
pages={NA},
month={NA},
abstract={Urban aquatic social-ecological systems (SESs) comprise socio-technical elements, the built environment and its management, and natural elements (water bodies) that provide ecosystem services. Changed hydrology, poor stormwater quality, and the modification of water bodies associated with urban development brings challenges for maintaining ecosystem services provision in an urban aquatic SES. Water sensitive urban design (WSUD) has emerged as a form of development that aims to better support the provision of ecosystem services. Resilience concepts provide a basis for discriminating between WSUD and conventional development approaches. Building on an existing decision support system, a new, preliminary method for assessing resilience based on the combination of the socio-technical capacity (STC) and natural capacity (NC) of urban aquatic SESs has been developed. The STC score reflects a multicriteria assessment of the characteristics of stormwater infrastructure and management. The NC score reflects an assessment of the state and trajectory of biophysical attributes of the system associated with the provision of ecosystem services. By modeling a series of future urban development scenarios in Auckland, New Zealand, the method has been shown to discriminate between scenario outcomes within constraints associated with the biophysical and built characteristics modeled. Results are consistent with key concepts of resilience theory: outcomes are grouped in regimes and exhibit hysteresis, with the ability of WSUD to improve the state of the system strongly influenced by the presence of legacy effects. The method provides a source of additional, valuable information that complements other indicators by providing a snapshot of the interaction of catchment management effort and outcomes and indicating the likely future state of the SES. Recognizing that the method is limited to providing a relative assessment of resilience and adopts certain simplistic assumptions, further research aims to investigate assessment methods that consider other, fundamental biophysical and social properties of urban aquatic SESs.},

abstract={Many ecosystems are actually social-ecological systems (SESs) consisting of mutually interacting natural and social subsystems. Resilience, the capacity to absorb or withstand perturbations while maintaining structure and functions, is an important feature of these systems. Indigenous or traditional knowledge is considered to be an important factor in being able to absorb change and maintain structure in the context of ecosystem dynamics. In this article, I use the framework of resilience to analyze how the Bedouin communities in Wadi Allaqi, Egypt, experienced and responded to the disturbing impact of Lake Nasser's formation in the mid-1960s. Prior to that disturbance, the Bedouin lifestyle was characterized by traditional pastoral life based on rotational grazing by their herds. Afterward, the Bedouins permanently settled along the shores to make use of the new abundant water resource. This resulted in overgrazing of the rangelands along the lakeside and the disappearance of the traditional pastoral lifestyle. However, the Bedouins later learned to use the Najas species in the lake, ushering in a new SES. This new system is based on tactical grazing along the shores, giving the rangelands the opportunity to recover from the temporary grazing pressure. I argue that because many degraded ecosystems are actually SESs, ecological restoration should also focus on societal-level measures.},

abstract={Adaptive management is a structured approach for people who must act despite uncertainty and complexity about what they are managing and the impacts of their actions. It is learning-by-doing through deliberate cycles of experimentation, review, and synthesis. However, understanding the processes of learning and how they relate to achieving resource management goals is in its infancy. Reflexive learning-a process of identifying and critically examining assumptions, values, and actions that frame knowledge-is critical to the effectiveness of adaptive management. It involves adaptive feedbacks between stakeholders as they examine assumptions, values, and actions. Adaptive management has been applied to environmental flows because it offers a system for making decisions about tradeoffs. In the Murray Darling Basin (MDB), Australia, adaptive management is applied as a cycle of plan, do, monitor, and learn, facilitated by short- and long-term learning among stakeholders. An alternative conceptualization of adaptive management as an integration of single-, double-, and triple-loop learning across multiple levels of governance is presented. This is applied to environmental flows in the MDB to map adaptive feedbacks of reflexive learning. At the lowest level of governance (Water Resource Planning Area), goals are assessed as Thresholds of Potential Concern related to flow-ecology responses, which are reviewed every 3-6 years. At the second level of governance (Basin-States), Water Management Targets are the key goals; reviewed and reframed every 6-10 years. The highest level of governance (the MDB) is concerned with policy targets, with review and reframing over 8-15 years. Feedbacks that generate reflexive learning are complex and require commitment to move through the modes of single-, double-, and triple-loop learning. Effective adaptive management of environmental water requires practitioners to situate themselves within a matrix of information flow across modes of learning, levels of governance, and components of a social-ecological system, where reflexive learning drives the achievement of management goals.},

abstract={There are growing efforts around the world to restore biocultural systems that produce food while also providing additional cultural and ecological benefits. Yet, there are few examples of integrated assessments of these efforts, impeding understanding of how they can contribute to multi-level sustainability goals. In this study, we collaborated with a community-based non-profit in Heeia, Oahu to evaluate future scenarios of traditional wetland and flooded field system agriculture (loi kalo; taro fields) restoration in terms of locally-relevant cultural, ecological, and economic outcomes as well as broader State of Hawaii sustainability goals around food, energy, and water. Families participating in the biocultural restoration program described a suite of community and cultural benefits stemming from the process of restoration, including enhanced social connections, cultural (re)connections to place, and physical and mental well-being, which inspired their sustained participation. We also found benefits in terms of local food production that have the potential to provide economic returns and energy savings over time, particularly when carried out through a hybrid non-profit and family management model. These benefits were coupled with potential changes in sediment and nutrient retention with implications for water quality and the health of an important downstream fish pond (loko ia) and coral reef social-ecological system. Compared with the current land cover (primarily invasive grasses), results suggest that full restoration of loi kalo would decrease sediment export by 38\%, but triple nitrogen export due to organic fertilizer additions. However, compared with an urban scenario, there were clear benefits of agricultural restoration in terms of reduced nitrogen and sediment runoff. In combination, our results demonstrate that a biocultural approach can support the social and financial sustainability of agricultural systems that provide multiple benefits valued by the local community and non-profit while also contributing to statewide sustainability goals.},

abstract={Problem statement: The Zayandehrood River as the most important ecological factor in Isfahan plain, is the main factor in maintaining habitat and regulating of the region's ecosystem. In recent years, due to different reasons, the Zayandehrood has faced some issues include climate change, drought, traditional view on dam construction, population increase, using the age-old fanning method, water-based industries, excessive water withdrawal, integrated management segregation and unprofessional and illegal resolutions, dehydration and dried-up crisis. These issues have caused intermittent interruption of river water flow in the Isfahan city, and consequently, deficiencies in the cultural, social, economic and tourism dimensions of the city. Research objective: The research is based on the theoretical origin of landscape architecture discipline and adopts a systematic view of natural phenomena, considers the most important issue regarding the Zayandehood River crisis in Isfahan in the separation of its constituent components as a result of the lack of a systematic and holistic view in its analysis and management. Therefore, the main strategy to solve this issue is the overview of the river as an integrated system, continuous understanding of ecological issues, and analyze the impact of society on the perception of an urban river. Research method: This is a case study based on library resources, field observations, visual documents, and the adaptation of ``understanding and analysis of the urban river as an integrated social-ecological system{''} theory as research method deals with understanding the subsystems, discovering its internal relations, conditions, pressure and flow rate of water in accordance with the situation of the Zayandehrood river. Conclusion: The result of this study shows that the inconsistency between pressure and internal flows in ecological and social subsystems in this structure unbalance this complex, and its adaptability and self-organization properties have been disrupted. The issue should be noticed by recovering the neglected relationships between key social components (values, people, and government) and the lost relationships between ecosystem conditions and processes and the role of social infrastructure in massive decisions, also by implementing multilevel programs, timely and strategically return this balance to the system.},

title={Applying the social-ecological system framework to the diagnosis of urban lake commons in Bangalore, India},
journal={ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
year={2014},
volume={19},
number={2},
pages={NA},
month={NA},
abstract={The south Indian city of Bangalore provides a challenging yet representative context within which to examine issues of governance of urban social-ecological commons. The city was once famous for its numerous large water bodies, which have witnessed tremendous encroachment and pollution in recent years. These water bodies, called tanks or lakes, were typically managed by adjacent village communities but are now administered by a number of government departments involved with aspects of lake management, with multiple overlapping jurisdictions. The public's perceptions of lakes has also changed with urbanization, transitioning from community spaces valued for water and cultural services to urban recreational spaces used largely by joggers and walkers. We focus on a set of seven lakes located in the urbanizing peripheral areas of southeast Bangalore. Some water bodies have been restored and managed effectively by newly forged collaborations between citizens and local government. Others are extremely polluted, and some have completely dried up and have been encroached. We use a social-ecological system (SES) framework to investigate why some locations have been successful in negotiating changes in governance from community-based systems to state management following urbanization, whereas other lakes have deteriorated. We use seven second-tier SES variables that were associated with self-organization in previous research: size of resource system, number of actors, leadership, social capital, importance of resource, existence of operational-choice rules, and existence of informal mechanisms for monitoring. We also include three third-tier variables previously identified as important in urban lake commons in Bangalore: scale and type of pre-existing pollution, exclusion of socioeconomic groups from the planning process, and networking with government organizations. We use this subset of 10 variables to examine social outcomes of the lakes, which we define as the extent of collective action by residents working together for lake restoration and ecological outcomes based on the ecological condition of the lakes. Collective action was low in only one of seven lakes, which challenges the presumption that citizens will not organize efforts to cope with common-pool problems. However, only two of seven lakes were highly successful in regard to both the extent of collective action and the level of ecological performance. While one lake was small and the other moderate in size, these two cases shared similar ranking in all other variables. Both lakes were polluted at a relatively low level compared with the other lakes, and in both cases, the leaders of local groups were able to network with government officials to clean up the lakes. Unfortunately, the challenge of cleaning up urban lakes after many decades of pollution is very difficult without effective interaction with various governmental units. Our analysis illustrates the usefulness of the SES framework in examining the combination of variables that makes a collective difference in affecting the outcomes of collective action and ecological performance. Our findings illustrate the need for polycentric arrangements in urban areas, whereby local residents are able to organize in diverse ways that reflect their own problems and capabilities, but can also work jointly with larger-scale governments to solve technical problems requiring changes in major engineering works as well as acquiring good scientific information. Such arrangements can reduce transaction costs for city governments by actively engaging local communities in processes that include coordination of collective activities, design of inclusive and locally suited ecological and social restoration goals, and planning and enforcement of regulations limiting access and withdrawal. At a time when many city governments are facing financial and administrative challenges that limit their ability to regulate and maintain urban commons, models of public-community partnerships could provide more inclusive, equitable, and sustainable institutional alternatives. This is an aspect that needs significant further consideration because the attention of most urban planners and scholars has remained on privatization while studies of successful instances of cooperative action in the urban context remain few and far between.},

title={Frontiers in paramo water resources research: A multidisciplinary assessment},
journal={SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},

volume={892},

month={SEP 20},
abstract={Interdisciplinary knowledge is necessary to achieve sustainable management of natural resources. However, research is still often developed in an exclusively disciplinary manner, hampering the capacity to holistically address environ-mental issues. This study focuses on paramo, a group of high-elevation ecosystems situated around \& SIM;3000 to -5000 m a.s.l. in the Andes from western Venezuela and northern Colombia through Ecuador down to northern Peru, and in the highlands of Panama and Costa Rica in Central America. Paramo is a social-ecological system that has been inhabited and shaped by human activity since-10,000 years BP. This system is highly valued for the water-related ecosystem services provided to millions of people because it forms the headwaters of major rivers in the Andean -Amazon region, including the Amazon River. We present a multidisciplinary assessment of peer-reviewed research on the abiotic (physical and chemical), biotic (ecological and ecophysiological), and social-political aspects and ele-ments of paramo water resources. A total of 147 publications were evaluated through a systematic literature review process. We found that thematically 58, 19, and 23 \% of the analyzed studies are related to the abiotic, biotic, and social-political aspects of paramo water resources, respectively. Geographically, most publications were developed in Ecuador (71 \% of the synthesized publications). From 2010 onwards, the understanding of hydrological processes including precipitation and fog dynamics, evapotranspiration, soil water transport, and runoff generation improved, particularly for the humid paramo of southern Ecuador. Investigations on the chemical quality of water generated by paramo are rare, providing little empirical support to the widespread belief that paramo environments generate water of high quality. Most ecological studies examined the coupling between paramo terrestrial and aquatic environ-ments, but few directly assessed in-stream metabolic and nutrient cycling processes. Studies focused on the connection between ecophysiological and ecohydrological processes influencing paramo water balance are still scarce and mainly related to the dominant vegetation in the Andean paramo, i.e., tussock grass (pajonal). Social-political studies ad-dressed paramo governance and the implementation and significance of water funds and payment for hydrological ser-vices. Studies directly addressing water use, access, and governance in paramo communities remain limited. Importantly, we found only a few interdisciplinary studies combining methodologies from at least two disciplines of different nature despite their value in supporting decision-making. We expect this multidisciplinary synthesis to be-come a milestone to foster interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary dialogue among individuals and entities involved in and committed to the sustainable management of paramo natural resources. Finally, we also highlight key frontiers in paramo water resources research, which in our view need to be addressed in the coming years/decades to achieve this goal.},

abstract={Major global initiatives such as the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have overlooked the prospects of the river ecosystem in achieving SDGs (e.g., SDGs 6, 14), despite the substantial role of the river in human civilisation, and the contribution of river restoration to ecological improvement. Realising the role of river social-ecological systems in providing ecosystem services (ES) to society, we have made the first step, through a systematic review, to identify progress, gaps and future research directions for river restoration research across the globe. We systematically reviewed articles and summarised the trends of river restoration within the explicit context of ES assessment. The economic and ecological aspects of river restoration were the prime focus of major studies, whereas social benefits have been least addressed. The results identified the research gaps and future opportunities and tried to supplement those gaps by addressing the questions that need to be researched in future studies. The proposed conceptual framework is designed how application of ES perspective help to integrate social benefits in river restoration research. If we are to achieve sustainable management of water, food production and zero hunger goals, overcoming the identified conceptual and methodological gaps and conceptualising the river as a social-ecological system is necessary for future river restoration research.},

abstract={Shaping policy for environmental sustainability depends upon decision-makers conceptualizing problems in ways that are either shared or similar enough to communicate about, diagnose, and act. The quality of this shared mental model of a social-ecological system (SES) is paramount to its effectiveness. Fundamentally, the mental model must integrate multiple kinds of knowledge about the system. If the decision-making body's assumptions about, description of, and solution for a problem do not to reflect the many ways stakeholders know a system, then the products of that decision-making process are viewed as illegitimate. Sustainability policy must fit the often subtle social order of the communities expected to implement it. In this essay, we discuss how a systems-based perspective can be a versatile tool for tackling these challenges of knowledge integration and decision-making in the context of a complex SES. Using social theory of Pierre Bourdieu, we construct a conceptual model that illustrates a route for integrating locally known social complexities (power, influence) gleaned from stakeholder interviews (N = 57). Stakeholders and end-user groups may dismiss any model that they perceive fails to satisfactorily account for specific, locally salient social nuances. Our approach leverages the overlapping notion of ``capital{''} in social and ecological theory to demonstrate how reciprocal interactions between human and ecological systems can be adopted into tools for reaching viable solutions to SES problems.},

title={An Integrative Dynamic Model of Colombian Population Distribution, Based on the Maximum Entropy Principle and Matter, Energy, and Information Flow},

abstract={Human society has increased its capacity to exploit natural resources thanks to new technologies, which are one of the results of information exchange in the knowledge society. Many approaches to understanding the interactions between human society and natural systems have been developed in the last decades, and some have included considerations about information. However, none of them has considered information as an active variable or flowing entity in the human-natural/social-ecological system, or, moreover, even as a driving force of their interactions. This paper explores these interactions in socio-ecological systems by briefly introducing a conceptual frame focused on the exchange of information, matter, and energy. The human population is presented as a convergence variable of these three physical entities, and a population distribution model for Colombia is developed based on the maximum entropy principle to integrate the balances of related variables as macro-state restrictions. The selected variables were electrical consumption, water demand, and higher education rates (energy, matter, and information). The final model includes statistical moments for previous population distributions. It is shown how population distribution can be predicted yearly by combining these variables, allowing future dynamics exploration. The implications of this model can contribute to bridging information sciences and sustainability studies.},

title={Farming by the sea: A qualitative-quantitative approach to capture the specific traits of coastal farming in Brittany, France},
journal={LAND USE POLICY},
year={2023},
volume={125},

pages={NA},
month={FEB},
abstract={The forms and presence itself of farming in coastal territories changed profoundly in the 20th century. By contrast with other interface farming systems, such as mountain or peri-urban farming, coastal farming has rarely been studied as such and has not, until now, been considered as a useful category to describe and analyse production systems. The aim of this article is thus to address the relevance of such a categorization, using empirical data collected in Brittany (France) as well as contextual indicators, but also by carrying out a systemic qualitative-quantitative analysis, questioning the forms, depth and continuity of marine influence on farming activities at the local scale. We show that specific traits of coastal farming do indeed exist. A greater diversity of farming systems exists in coastal strip than inland at the regional scale. Four configurations of coastal farming were identified, which result from distinct dynamics and combinations of urbanization and environmental pressures on agriculture. But these specific features cannot be revealed without a comprehensive and historicized approach of its interactions with the coastal zone as a territory, rather than a biophysical milieu. These con-figurations are characterized in the typical spatial extent of coastal farming and spatial patterns of the transition to inland farming (gradient, discontinuities).},

month={FEB},
abstract={Recurrent food crises and global environmental change are critical issues that pushed food security and sustainability to the top of the policy agenda. Policy-makers need assessment tools that help them decide what actions they should take to achieve these goals. This paper proposes a new metric system assessing the sustainability of food systems and diets at a subnational level adapted to the context of the Mediterranean area. Recognizing the systemic dimension of sustainability, the proposed information system builds on a vulnerability/resilience conceptual framework and considers the interactions between a set of biophysical and socioeconomic drivers of vulnerability and a number of context-specific food and nutrition security issues. A three-round iterative Delphi survey was conducted to involve a number of selected experts in the indicator selection process. 18 indicators were finally identified for eight preselected causal models of vulnerability and resilience at the interactions between a set of four drivers of change (water depletion, biodiversity loss, food price volatility, and changes in food consumption patterns) and four food and nutrition security outcomes (nutritional quality of food supply, affordability of food, dietary energy balance, and satisfaction of cultural food preferences). Each interaction was disentangled in exposure, sensitivity and resilience. The exercise allowed discussion of a conceptual and dynamic framework for food systems, and identification of indicators that gather consensus among the expert community.},

month={JAN},
abstract={Either meeting the UNFCCC Paris agreement to limit global average warming below the 2-1.5 degrees C threshold, or going beyond it entails huge challenges in terms of institutional innovation and transformation. This research describes a participatory integrated assessment process aimed at exploring the options, opportunities, necessary capacities and implications for institutional co-operation and innovation in the Iberian Peninsula under High-End Climate Change (HECC). Using in-depth interviews and a novel participatory research approach, different scenario narratives and pathways about the future of Iberia have been identified using Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs). Special attention is given to the knowledge and policy options needed to implement cross-border organizational changes and co-operation mechanisms that would support the Integrated Climate Governance of the Tagus and Guadiana river basins. We show that a wealth of institutional innovation pathways and specific options and solutions exist not only to reduce GHG emissions (mitigation) and the negative impacts of climate change (adaptation), but, above all, to generate new forms of social-ecological system interactions aligned with sustainability (transformation). In particular, and depending on which scenario contexts unfold in the future in Iberia, different kinds of institutional and governance capacities and clusters of solutions may be needed in order to achieve transformation.},

abstract={Understanding the complex dynamics of social-ecological systems (SES) is difficult because rigorous methodologies and methods for this purpose are lacking. Multi-scale (temporal and geographical) linkages and pathways can mask feedbacks. Thus, understanding SES requires multi-dimensional analyses. This study presents a potential methodology and method for multi-dimensional analyses of a SES in the Upper Rio Grande-San Luis Valley (URG-SLV), Colorado. A driver identification process identified 5 major drivers in the URG-SLV, including stream flow, climate, agriculture, and endogenous and exogenous policy. Several of these drivers possessed more than one longitude. Data for these drivers begins as early as 1852 and extends to 2007. Changes in driver longitudes (long-term datasets within a single driver; maximum, minimum and mean annual temperature comprise climate longitudes) were detected via change point analysis, occurring at several transitional points. Linkages were defined using known relationships between drivers (e.g., stream flow and water rights). Cross-scale relationships between the URG-SLV and downstream users through policy changes and climate also presented a temporal cross-scale linkage. Using the relationships and cross-scale linkages, a historical evolution of the system was constructed throughout the 150-plus years of record to illustrate the effects of changes in drivers and cross-scale linkages in the system.},

abstract={Managing ecosystem service (ES) bundles to synergize their benefits is a crucial but challenging task for land-scape planning and sustainable development. However, few studies have focused on ES bundles for landscape management in complex mountainous social-ecological systems. In this study, we quantified four ESs, food supply, soil conservation, water conservation, and habitat quality, in the Bailongjiang watershed (BLJW) in western China by using multi-source geospatial data and related ecological and societal information from 1990 to 2016. We found significant spatial and temporal changes in ES patterns and their relationships measured in 1990, 2002, 2010, and 2016. We found both strong positive and negative relationships (P < 0.01) among ESs in the four time-intervals. The BLJW was divided into five landscape functional zones by the newly integrated method to link ES bundles and social-ecological indicators for landscape management. Land use, population density, agriculture, and animal husbandry were found to have greatly affected the ES pattern and the comprehensive ecosystem service benefit of the BLJW. We suggest governing the mountainous social-ecological system with the goal of building a watershed community of common destiny with a shared future for ESs and for integrated landscape management.},

year={2020},
volume={186},
number={1},
pages={NA},
month={MAR},
abstract={Climate-driven environmental changes bring new risks but also opportunities to populations living along the world's major rivers. Based on ethnoecological fieldwork, in this paper we examine how people living in the cuvette centrale of the Congo basin have adopted flood-recession agriculture on islands in the Congo River, taking advantage of a secular shift since the 1980s in the hydrological regime of the Congo River. Analyses of the hydrological data reveal that this shift decreased flood risk and significantly extended the growing season on the islands, long enough to enable cultivation of fast-maturing varieties of manioc and other crops. Flood-recession farming on islands in the river is today not only an important source of food, but also a source of income for women, who are primarily responsible for seasonal cultivation of fields during the low-water season. Hydrological changes alone are insufficient to explain the adoption of the new agricultural practice; adoption also arose as a result of dynamic interactions among river fishing, trading, and broader socio-economic forces. Climate-change models project an increased frequency of extreme floods. Our results suggest that this change may limit island cultivation in the future. More generally, our findings point to the importance of looking beyond single-factor, solely environmental explanations in studies of climate-change adaptation.},

abstract={The Murray-Darling Basin is a Social-Ecological System (SES) of major importance to Australia and includes extensive wetland areas in the north-western parts of New South Wales. The Gwydir Wetlands and the Macquarie Marshes are the particular focus of this paper. These two wetland SES have undergone five successive adaptive cycles ( phases) since they were first visited by Europeans in the early 19th century and the ecological, economic and social drivers initiating each transformation to a new cycle are described and analysed. The arrival of the European settlers with their domestic livestock rapidly displaced the Indigenous SES and the wetlands were extensively grazed; during wet periods the livestock were moved out of the wetlands and moved back in as the water receded. More recent land-use changes resulted from the building of major dams to enable storage of water for use in irrigated agriculture. A consequence of dam construction and water use has been a reduction in the frequency and extent of flooding, which has allowed many parts of the wetlands to be continually grazed. Furthermore, as machinery capable of cultivating the very heavy textured soils became available, dryland cropping became a major enterprise in areas of the floodplain where the likelihood of flooding was reduced. With the reduction in flooding, these wetland sites have been seriously degraded. The final phase has seen the invasion by an exotic weed, lippia {[}Phyla canescens (Kunth) Greene], which is a perennial that grows mat-like between other species of plants and spreads to produce a virtually mono-specific stand. The domestic livestock carrying capacity of the land becomes more or less zero and the conservation value of the wetlands is also dramatically decreased. Therefore, we suggest that lippia should be classed as an ecosystem engineer that has caused the latest transformation of these wetland SES and suggest research directions to investigate how they can be managed to revert to a state in which lippia is no longer dominant.},

title={Addressing the resilience of tomato farmers in Ghana facing a double exposure from climate and market},
journal={ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
year={2022},
volume={27},
number={3},
pages={NA},
month={SEP},
abstract={Ghanaian tomato farmers are severely impacted by changing climate and related more frequent and extreme weather events such as drought and heavy rainfall. Furthermore, tomato production represents one of the main sources of income for these farmers, which leaves them highly exposed to market price variations. However, the full impact of changing climate and price variations for these farmers has not been assessed. Here, we examined how Ghanaian tomato farmers experience and respond to a double exposure from climate and market related shocks. The objectives were threefold: (i) to investigate how farmers in two different agroecological zones (savannah and semi-equatorial) experience climate and market shocks, (ii) to examine the major response strategies implemented in face of this double exposure, and (iii) to identify paths toward systemic changes to enhance resilience. A survey was conducted with 344 tomato smallholder farmers in the two agroecological zones. The results from the survey were complemented by semi-structured interviews and focus groups. We found that farmers are severely exposed to climate and market shocks, which causes a reduction in both production activities and revenues. A set of agricultural and water management practices, such as crop rotation, supplementary fertilization, and water tanks, have been adopted by farmers as response mechanisms to climate variations. However, no response mechanisms, other than agricultural diversification, are in place yet to face the economic shocks. Thus, enhancing systemic resilience becomes particularly important to face this double exposure and restructure and change feedback mechanisms within the current system. The reestablishment of tomato processing plants or formalizing the stakeholders' network could both be ways to integrate value-chain stakeholders and support appropriate structures. Encompassing both climate and trading attributes through specific agro-food policies are much-needed for a sustainable and resilient transformation of the tomato production system.},

abstract={Drylands are one of the most diverse yet highly vulnerable social-ecological systems on Earth. Water scarcity has contributed to high levels of heterogeneity, variability and unpredictability, which together have shaped the long coadaptative process of coupling humans and nature. Land degradation and desertification in drylands are some of the largest and most far-reaching global environmental and social change problems, and thus are a daunting challenge for science and society. In this study, we merged the Drylands Development Paradigm, Holling's adaptive cycle metaphor and resilience theory to assess the challenges and opportunities for livelihood development in the Amapola dryland social-ecological system (DSES), a small isolated village in the semi-arid region of Mexico. After 450 years of local social-ecological evolution, external drivers (neoliberal policies, change in land reform legislation) have become the most dominant force in livelihood development, at the cost of loss of natural and cultural capital and an increasingly dysfunctional landscape. Local DSESs have become increasingly coupled to dynamic larger-scale drivers. Hence, cross-scale connectedness feeds back on and transforms local self-sustaining subsistence farming conditions, causing loss of livelihood resilience and diversification in a globally changing world. Effective efforts to combat desertification and improve livelihood security in DSESs need to consider their cyclical rhythms. Hence, we advocate novel dryland stewardship strategies, which foster adaptive capacity, and continuous evaluation and social learning at all levels. Finally, we call for an effective, flexible and viable policy framework that enhances local biotic and cultural diversity of drylands to transform global drylands into a resilient biome in the context of global environmental and social change.},

pages={644-654},
month={DEC},
abstract={Coastal deltas are landforms that typically offer a wide variety of benefits to society including highly fertile soils for agricultural development, freshwater resources, and rich biodiversity. For these reasons, many deltas are densely populated, are important economic hubs, and have been transformed by human interventions such as agricultural intensification, modification of water and sediment fluxes, as well as urbanization and industrialization. Additionally, deltas are increasingly affected by the consequences of climate change including sea level rise, and by other natural hazards such as cyclones and storm surges. Five examples of major deltas (Rhine-Meuse, Ganges, Indus, Mekong, and Danube) illustrate the force of human interventions in shaping and transforming deltas and in inducing shifts between four different social-ecological system (SES) states: Holocene, modified Holocene, Anthropocene and `collapsed'. The three Asian deltas are rapidly changing but whereas SES in the Ganges and Indus deltas are in danger of tipping into a `collapsed' state, SES in the Mekong delta, which is at the crossroads of various development pathways, could increase in resilience in the future. The Rhine-Meuse and Danube delta examples show that highly managed states may allow, under specific conditions, for interventions leading to increasingly resilient systems. However, little is known about the long-term effects of rapid human interventions in deltas. It is therefore critical to increase the knowledge-base related to SES dynamics and to better characterize social tipping points or turning points in order to avoid unacceptable changes.},

abstract={This paper provides an in-depth understanding of social dynamics in the form of kinship ties in matrilineal societies. It unpacks gender roles and relationships at the community level to understand how social structures, created by the pattern of relations, enhance or hinder coping initiatives during lake recessions in the Lake Chilwa socio-ecological system. Using qualitative and quantitative methods including in-depth interviews, Focus Group Discussions (FGD) and household questionnaires, this paper provides insights into how people in the Lake Chilwa social-ecological system prepare for and cope with Lake Chilwa water recessions by capitalising on their social networks. The findings have shown that during lake recessions poor households in the Lake Chilwa socio-ecological system are cushioned by fellow households through lineage networks. There is strong tradition secured through kinship ties where the generic term `mwambo wathu' (our tradition) embraces a group of formative norms enforced via a series of rules and rituals. Based in a matrilineal system, women have strong rights over land allocation and use in which the female sorority group `mbumba' is very stable. There is a great deal of reciprocity and food redistribution among the households. This self-organization provides deeper meaning about how people assimilate the dynamics affecting their social and natural environments. Specifically the findings provide evidence on how households, communities and their livelihoods in Africa are reconstructed as natural resources fluctuate. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Social-ecological resilience of freshwater systems in lower Mekong basin in southeast Asia is largely unknown. Over the recent past, the freshwater ecosystems in the region have gone through severe environmental stress. Climate change, sea level rise, over-extraction of water and eutrophication together have increased vulnerability to regime shifts of ecosystems in the region. Regime shifts can have long-lasting effects on social-ecological resilience. Response diversity plays a central role in linking ecological, social, and financial systems and enhances resilience. Documenting regime shifts and associated feedbacks as well as the role of response diversity in social-ecological resilience and ecosystem goods and services in the region is essential for future sustainability. In this study, primarily, I have described mechanisms behind emergence of feedback loops at a time of regime shifts and its impacts on ecological resilience. Secondly, I have developed a framework for social-ecological resilience of freshwater ecosystems for southeast Asian region. Thirdly, I have provided current contexts of social-ecological resilience of two of the most productive freshwater ecosystems in the lower Mekong basin of southeast Asia: the Tonle Sap Lake (Cambodia) and the Vietnamese Mekong Delta. Finally, in conclusion, I have outlined the key roles response diversity plays in showing the effects of environmental stress and maintaining social-ecological resilience in the region.},

abstract={The Tsitsa River catchment is a complex social-ecological system (cSES) in a rural area of the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa and the site of the Tsitsa Project (TP); a multi-stakeholder, transdisciplinary landscape restoration project aiming to improve sustainable livelihoods and ecological infrastructure. We investigated transformation mechanisms in a framing of multidimensional linkages, including the recognition of differentiated scales and levels. Linkages were analysed through the development of two vignettes: 1) a citizen technician employed to monitor sediment loads in rivers to inform landscape restoration activities (local scale); and 2) a senior government official responsible for (regional scale) operational and on-the-ground restoration initiatives. Vignette data were generated during a workshop, from TP researcher reflexivity, and interviews with the TP Catchment Coordinator and vignette subjects. Data were analysed and presented: i) as a heuristic diagram, ii) through a narrative, and iii) as a matrix table. Each analysis incorporated a different conceptualisation of scale in relation to four social processes related to transformative change: learning, agency, power and structure. Transformation is demonstrated and leverage points and areas of intractability for promoting and constraining future transformation towards social-ecological sustainability, were identified respectively. Further, we suggest that an understanding of transformative processes was enriched and nuanced by combining a triad of complementary analytical exercises. These allowed a focus on unique stories and contexts, but also the identification of generalisable patterns and mechanisms.},

title={Robust-yet-fragile nature of partly engineered social-ecological systems: a case study of coastal Bangladesh},
journal={ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
year={2017},
volume={22},
number={3},
pages={NA},
month={NA},
abstract={Modern social-ecological systems are often partly engineered to enhance the robustness (or reduce the variance) of human welfare to environmental fluctuations over a foreseeable time horizon. Recent studies show, however, that subtle trade-offs are usually inherent in such efforts of enhancing short-term robustness. Managing variance on short time scales is likely to be associated with the buildup of hidden fragilities on longer time scales. Using a flood-prone social-ecological system (SES) of coastal Bangladesh as an example, this paper investigates some of the ways in which such robustness-fragility trade-offs can manifest. This SES has been extensively modified in the last few decades through the construction of large-scale flood protection structures (polders) and the introduction of commercial shrimp farming to enhance the robustness of food production to hydrological variability. Our case study analysis of the long-term changes in the SES shows that, although the modifications helped with stability in short time scales, the resulting changes also induced unforeseen problems such as infrastructure maintenance issues, land degradation and sinking, and exposure to market volatility. With this paper therefore we contribute to better understanding of the notion of robustness-fragility trade-offs by illustrating an exemplary case of the phenomenon in the engineered coastal environment context.},

abstract={The city of Saint-Louis is marked by recurrent floods, despite the decrease in rainfall. The town that grew downstream the vast plain where Senegalese-Mauritanian basin topography flattens considerably has experienced periodic flooding since its foundation. In 2003, the premature flooding of the Senegal River urged the Senegalese authorities to take the initiative to open a breach in the coastal sand strip of the ``Langue de Barbarie,{''} in order to evacuate the water surplus from the river to the ocean and therefore resolve forever the problem of river flooding. But the disruption of estuarine dynamics has led to a rapid expansion of this gap: a few meters wide at its excavation, it reaches over 2,700 m in August 2009. Moreover, 10 months after the widening of the gap, the old river mouth was completely closed. If the natural movement of a mouth can be observed on some major deltas in the world (even on the Senegal River in the past), this is here a true man-made relocation. Based on the statistical analysis of series of hydrological data, this article demonstrates on the one hand that climatic conditions in 2003 which generated a major flood is an anomaly detected in the sequence of dry climate variability observed in the Sahel. On the other hand, it studies the rapid evolution of this new mouth of the Senegal River and discusses some of impacts on the regional social-ecological system, in this sensitive Sahelian environment.},

journal={FRESHWATER SCIENCE},
year={2015},
volume={34},
number={3},
pages={1161-1168},
month={SEP},
abstract={Restoration of ecological structure and function of urban streams probably requires catchment-scale modification of drainage infrastructure, but such catchment-scale restoration attempts and their assessment are rare. They require stream ecologists to embrace the interdisciplinary challenges of studying the social-ecological systems that are urban catchments. We designed and monitored a catchment-scale experiment that involved the retrofit of urban stormwater infrastructure throughout an urban catchment to restore more natural hydrology, water quality, and consequently, ecological condition in the receiving stream. We worked with government authorities and the catchment community (residents and property owners) over several years to fund and implement 289 stormwater retention systems. The length of the project allowed adaptation of the experimental design to expand the project's breadth and of retention-system design to match community needs and catchment context. Planning provisions are particularly important for such an experiment to ensure that the effect of dispersed experimental treatments is not countered by creation of new connected impervious areas elsewhere in the catchment. Catchment-scale experiments can help to transform policy and practice, but their success requires substantial effort and time to build trust among the numerous, diverse stakeholders of human-dominated urban ecosystems. Researchers need to be prepared to adopt an adaptive approach to the implementation of such experiments and to play the lead role in seeking funds for the implementation of the on-ground works necessary to underpin the experiment.},

title={Quantifying the effects of diverse private protected area management systems on ecosystem properties in a savannah biome, South Africa},
journal={ORYX},
year={2013},
volume={47},
number={1},
pages={29-40},
month={JAN},
abstract={The effects of management on ecosystem diversity, structure and function must be understood for the sustainable integration of conservation and development. A potential source of experimentation and learning in ecosystem management is the array of private protected areas worldwide. Autonomous management systems can be seen as natural experiments, presenting an opportunity to explore the consequences of manipulating ecosystem properties. By quantifying management diversity and developing an index of management intensity we assessed the ecological correlates of private protected area management within the savannah biome in South Africa. Management intensity is positively correlated with herbivore density, predator density and ecotourism lodge density and negatively with herbivore community heterogeneity, reintroduction success and primary productivity at the local protected area scale. However, these trade-offs are tantamount to functional diversity as different management systems play unique roles in the regional socio-ecological and socio-economic systems, which range from animal production centres high in commercial value to low density areas that may sustain landscape processes. Furthermore, fenced private protected areas are necessary to safeguard rare species that cannot sustain viable populations in altered ecosystems. Thus, when considered at the regional scale, a private protected area network that constitutes a patchwork of management systems will create a coincident conservation and production landscape. We suggest that maintaining management heterogeneity will provide net benefits to biodiversity and potentially galvanize locally sustainable, wildlife-based economies.},

title={Limited use of transformative adaptation in response to social-ecological shifts driven by climate change},
journal={ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
year={2020},
volume={25},
number={1},
pages={NA},
month={MAR},
abstract={Climate change is increasingly driving fundamental shifts in ecosystems, land use, and human livelihoods. Because of these rapid shifts, some conventional adaptation strategies may have limited success in reducing the impact of climate change. In some circumstances, there will be a need for considering transformative changes as part of adaptation strategies that can provide long-term benefits and address the root causes of vulnerability. However, to date, there is limited understanding of how societies respond to, or drive, transformative changes in social-ecological systems due to climate change impact. We reviewed 60 empirical case studies of shifts in trajectories of social-ecological systems in tropical and subtropical countries that were driven by climate change to identify how societies responded to these shifts and the extent to which societies used transformative adaptation as part of this response. In the case studies, we identified three types of shifts driven by climate change depending on whether the shift occurred in the ecological, social, or social-ecological system. Climate change shifted the trajectories of social-ecological systems by altering the feedback loops connecting soil, water, or vegetation conditions with peoples livelihoods and well-being. In response to these shifts, people adjusted land use policies and practices, but only one-quarter of the reported adaptation actions included transformative adaptation. A more holistic understanding of how climate change modifies interactions in social-ecological systems and leads to shifts in system trajectories could help identify appropriate adaptation responses, including transformative adaptation, that provide long-term and sustainable benefits.},

abstract={Poverty alleviation linked to agricultural intensification has been achieved in many regions but there is often only limited understanding of the impacts on ecological dynamics. A central need is to observe long term changes in regulating and supporting services as the basis for assessing the likelihood of sustainable agriculture or ecological collapse. We show how the analyses of 55 time-series of social, economic and ecological conditions can provide an evolutionary perspective for the modern Lower Yangtze River Basin region since the 1950s with powerful insights about the sustainability of modern ecosystem services. Increasing trends in provisioning ecosystem services within the region over the past 60 years reflect economic growth and successful poverty alleviation but are paralleled by steep losses in a range of regulating ecosystem services mainly since the 1980s. Increasing connectedness across the social and ecological domains after 1985 points to a greater uniformity in the drivers of the rural economy. Regime shifts and heightened levels of variability since the 1970s in local ecosystem services indicate progressive loss of resilience across the region. Of special concern are water quality services that have already passed critical transitions in several areas. Viewed collectively, our results suggest that the regional social-ecological system passed a tipping point in the late 1970s and is now in a transient phase heading towards a new steady state. However, the long-term relationship between economic growth and ecological degradation shows no sign of decoupling as demanded by the need to reverse an unsustainable trajectory.

abstract={Climate is changing at an unprecedented rate with impacts being felt in social and ecological systems around the world. Opportunities for building climate resilience of the social-ecological system surrounding freshwater areas are assessed using the aquatic monitoring and reporting programs of Muskoka River Watershed (Ontario, Canada) as a case study. A three-step study design was used: establishment of a knowledge baseline (i.e., what has been done), confirmation of the baseline to ensure perspectives that emerged were inclusive of multiple stakeholders (i.e., broadly applicable) and an exploratory workshop to disseminate recommendations and discuss implementation with key stakeholders. Two themes are discussed: the strengthening of watershed-scale monitoring approaches, and improved communication with stakeholders (e.g., through `state of the watershed' reporting). This study offers an evaluation of watershed-scale aquatic monitoring and reporting and provides concrete examples from the case study. We test a new process for refining, selecting, or prioritizing indicators for aquatic monitoring. Cumulative effects assessment and monitoring (CEAM) is considered as the suggested monitoring approach at a watershed-scale. Recommendations for developing CEAM in the Muskoka River Watershed include considerations for selection of monitoring indicators, consistent communication of indicators, and implementing a metadatabase. Ways to enhance education of, and engagement with, local stakeholders through improved `state of the watershed' report cards are highlighted. Resilience is strengthened by addressing two goals in the case study: engaging with the community and improving knowledge of stressor-effect relationships in the watershed via stronger aquatic monitoring.},

abstract={This Special Feature, ``Nudging Evolution? Critical Exploration of the Potential and Limitations of the Concept of Institutional Fit for the Study and Adaptive Management of Social-Ecological Systems,{''} aims to contribute toward the development of social theory and social research methods for the study of social-ecological system dynamics. Our objective is to help strengthen the academic discourse concerning if, and if so, how, to what extent, and in what concrete ways the concept of institutional ``fit{''} might play a role in helping to develop better understanding of the social components of interlinkages between the socioeconomic-cultural and ecological dynamics of social-ecological systems. Two clearly discernible patterns provide a map of this Special Feature: (1) One pattern is the authors' positions regarding the place and role of normativity within their studies and assessment of institutional fit. Some place this at the center of their studies, exploring phenomena endogenous to the process of defining what constitutes institutional fit, whereas others take the formation of norms as a phenomenon exogenous to their study. (2) Another pattern is the type of studies presented: critiques and elaborations of the theory, methods for judging qualities of fit, and/or applied case studies using the concept. As a body of work, these contributions highlight that self-understanding of social-ecological place, whether explicit or implicit, constitutes an important part of the study object, i. e., the role of institutions in social-ecological systems, and that this is, at the same time, a crucial point of reference for the scholar wishing to evaluate what constitutes institutional fit and how it might be brought into being.},

pages={616-629},

abstract={The Venice Lagoon social-ecological system is characterized by a strong relationship between the natural environment and human activities. This is especially noticeable in the aquaculture and hunting reserves of the lagoon, locally known as valli da pesca. Previous works about ecosystem services (ESs) in the Venice Lagoon focused on the so-called ``open lagoon,{''} overlooking the role of the valli da pesca. Nonetheless, despite being completely managed ecosystems, the valli da pesca have conserved typical elements of transitional water environments that the other parts of the lagoon have lost. By evaluating nine ESs using a spatially explicit approach, we found that the valli da pesca, despite covering 17\% of the surface, are contributing for 38\% of the ESs total capacity, and for 24\% of the ESs total flow, in comparison with the open part of the lagoon. Moreover, the management that aims to maximize in a perspective of sustainability of some provisioning ESs, such as extensive aquaculture, can positively influence the presence of factors on which other ESs capacity is also based. As a result, the open lagoon benefits from a sort of spill-over effect for lifecycle support, hunting, and cultural ESs such as tourism, information for cognitive development, and birdwatching. Such significant contributions could be endangered in the context of a lagoon subjected to increasing pressures from anthropic activities where even adaptations to impacts, as well as to climate change and sea-level rise effects, in the long run will modify the lagoon hydrodynamics and the sea-lagoon connectivity, threatening the valli da pesca and so their ESs supply.},

title={Bogs, birds, and berries in Belarus: the governance and management dynamics of wetland restoration in a state-centric, top-down context},
journal={ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
year={2021},
volume={26},
number={1},
pages={NA},
month={MAR},
abstract={Wetlands are complex social-ecological systems, which provide both important habitat for species, and multiple tangible and intangible benefits for people. Sustaining long-term benefits through restoration, conservation, and sustainable use is often linked to integrative and adaptive approaches to wetlands management. Such approaches assume democratic ideals, and require multilevel, multisector, and multiactor participation in governance and management arrangements. How then can functional wetlands be restored and sustainably managed as social-ecological systems in strongly state-centric, top-down governance contexts, such as in former Soviet republics? Using three case studies of wetland restoration and management for ecosystem functionality, biodiversity conservation, and human livelihoods, we employ a complex systems approach to analyze key governance and management dynamics underpinning initiatives toward sustainable wetlands in Belarus. We identified five core processes, namely, planning, garnering stakeholder support, obtaining key inputs (financial, human, material, technological, fixed capital), implementing core activities, and integrating learning and knowledge cycles. Key constraints concerned institutional hierarchies, onerous regulations, ``negativism,{''} and financing difficulties. Strategies relating to perception management, risk mitigation, and learning are identified as key to enabling beneficial feedback loops relating to core processes. Although path-dependent societal dynamics of the Soviet era continue to influence wetland systems, combinations of social and ecological crises created windows of opportunity for active participation among nongovernmental actors. Major opportunities for enabling emergent management approaches included identification of confluences of interest amongst stakeholders, as well as the continued mutual integration of Belarus with the international community.},

volume={21},
number={2, SI},
pages={464-473},
month={MAY},
abstract={Alaska is among the fastest warming places on Earth, and the Interior region is warming the most statewide. Significant regional-scale ecosystem services disruptions are affecting Alaska Natives' subsistence hunting and harvest success. The well-being of rural native communities is still highly dependent on access and ability to harvest wild foods such as salmon and moose (Alces alces gigas) among many others. Over the last decade communities in the Koyukuk-Middle Yukon (KMY) region of Interior Alaska report an inability to satisfy their needs for harvesting moose before the hunting season closes, citing warmer falls, changing precipitation and water levels, and the regulatory framework as primary causes. Through the integration of ethnographic methods to record indigenous observations and understanding of climate (IC) with analysis of meteorological data, we provide a comprehensive picture of vulnerability to recent warming trends in the Koyukuk-Middle Yukon region of Interior Alaska, one that captures more than statistical analysis of ``norms{''} can provide. We will demonstrate how low exposure resulting in a small shift in seasonality has truly socially significant effects to people ``on the ground{''} when community sensitivity is high because of the convergence of multiple social-ecological stressors. In this case, a seemingly small climatic exposure when combined with high social-ecological system sensitivity results in vulnerability to this climate change-related seasonality shift because of: (a) the effects on moose and the social-ecological dynamics of the system, and (b) the importance of this time of the year to meeting annual subsistence needs.

pages={765-780},
month={NOV},
abstract={Quantitative indicators are a common means of assessing the complex dimensions of a sustainable freshwater system, and framing scientific knowledge for policy and decision makers. There is an abundance of indicators in use, but considerable variation in terms of what is being measured and how indicators are applied, making it difficult for end-users to identify suitable assessment methods. We review 95 water-related indices and analyze them along their normative, procedural, and systemic dimensions to better understand how problems are being defined, highlight overlaps and differences, and identify the context(s) in which a particular index is useful. We also analyze the intended use, end-users, and geographic scale of application for each index. We find that risk assessment is the most common application (n = 25), with indices in this group typically focusing either on hazard identification (biophysical assessments) or vulnerability of human populations. Indices that measure freshwater ecological health are not explicitly linking these indicators to ecosystem services, and in fact the concept of ecosystem services is rarely (n = 3) used for indicator selection. Resource managers are the most common group of intended end-users (n = 25), but while 28 indices involved consultation with potential end-users, 11 did not specify an intended use. We conclude that indices can be applied as solution-oriented tools, evaluating scenarios and identifying tradeoffs among services and beneficiaries, rather than only assessing and monitoring existing conditions. Finally, earlier engagement of end-users is recommended to help researchers find the right balance among indices' salience, legitimacy, and credibility and thus improve their decision relevance.},

journal={ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},

volume={19-20},
number={NA},

month={MAY-JUN},
abstract={The present study analyzes the relationship between landscape multi-functionality and social preferences toward Mediterranean landscapes in terms of monetary and non-monetary techniques. Twenty landscape views were selected as representative of the landscape units characterizing Nacimiento and Adra semi-arid watersheds (southeastern Spain). Face-to-face questionnaires were used to assess social factors that influence willingness to pay for aesthetic landscape enjoyment (use value) and landscape conservation (non-use value). Meanwhile, an expert focus group analyzed the capacity of the selected semi-arid ecosystems for supplying services to society. The favorite landscape views mainly contained steeper reliefs, water flows, and traditional human activities. Our results suggest a strong positive effect between respondents' place attachment and the level of support for landscape conservation. Respondents were more willing to pay for the conservation of semi-arid rural landscapes when their sense of belonging was greater. We also found that multi-functional landscapes, which provide higher numbers of regulating and cultural services, were also preferred in terms of their visual quality (use value). Additionally, they had more social support for their conservation (non-use value). The conversion of multi-functional landscapes to mono-functional ones disturbs the stability of rural areas, their capacity to provide other ecosystem services, and the social support toward their preservation. To reverse this tendency, two major ideas should be emphasized. The first is the necessity of considering the ecological components and processes behind landscapes, and the second is the role of the local population on rural landscape conservation.

title={Transfers of vulnerability through adaptation plan implementation: an analysis based on networks of feedback control loops},
journal={ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
year={2020},
volume={25},
number={2},
pages={NA},
month={JUN},
abstract={With the increasing number of adaptation plans being generated across the world at multiple scales and levels of organization, the issue of coordination among plans is emerging as a significant challenge. We focus on how lack of coordination may constrain their efficiency as a result of potential transfers of vulnerability. This paper focuses on interdependencies between autonomous feedback control loops that represent adaptation processes and makes the link between autonomous action and (social-ecological) system levels. These interdependencies allow changes in vulnerability of one adaptation actor as a consequence of the reduction of vulnerability of another actor. We refer to the processes behind such changes as ``vulnerability transfers{''} and suggest the need for their identification so that actors may make agreements to address them explicitly. A thorough analysis of each step involved in a feedback control loop enables the identification of potential interdependencies, leading to seven basic types of vulnerability transfer. The analysis of example cases of observed transfers of vulnerability in three coastal case studies then demonstrate the suitability of feedback control loop networks to assess, ex-ante, potential vulnerability transfers. The example cases feature all types of theoretically possible vulnerability transfers. Initial empirical investigation showcases the relative importance of shared infrastructures in generating transfers of vulnerability. It also helps to reveal forgotten links to avoid decreasing efficiency of adaptation processes beyond each autonomous agent's jurisdiction. Our representation contributes to a more comprehensive ex-ante identification of transfers and hence the possibility to discuss and manage them.},

abstract={The Laurentian Great Lakes system holds approximately 20\% of the world's available surface freshwater and represents an immense economic engine for the region. Lake Erie, one of the five North American Great Lakes is classified as highly stressed and deteriorating with significant flooding and erosion issues stemming from record-high water levels. This study adapts a well-established oceanic coastal vulnerability index to estimate impacts and risks of lake-level rise on the Ohio portion of Lake Erie coastal social-ecological system. The authors worked closely with coastal engineers, planners, and other practitioners associated with the Ohio Department of Natural Resources (ODNR) and the Office of Coastal Management (OCM) to help adapt a scientifically-grounded framework for natural resource and policy decision making. Overall, place-based risk and vulnerability to flooding and erosion necessitates an integrated approach that combines socio-economic, built-environment, political boundaries, and bio-physical characteristics. While most of the integrated methodologies are focused on the oceanic coasts at the county scale, this research presents a model for Lake Erie-relevant variables at the higher-resolution census-tract unit of analysis and a coastal vulnerability index at 100-foot intervals along the coastline for four decades and each season. The result is both a foundation for Ohio's Department of Natural Resources, Office of Coastal Management to identify scientifically-informed, place-based priority management areas for flooding and erosion, as well as a methodological roadmap to adapt the Coastal and Place Vulnerability Indices to the other Great Lakes' states and provincial shorelines.},

volume={13},

abstract={Background: Pastoral social-ecological systems (SESs) are adaptive and complex systems rooted in the extensive exploitation of forage plants for livestock-based livelihoods and culture. There are species and relations that are foundational to the existence of these SESs. Nucularia perrinii Batt. (Chenopodiaceae) is an endemic halophyte plant of central and western Sahara seldom cited in the scientific literature. The objective of this study was to investigate the role of this plant in the SES of the Sahrawi camel nomads of Western Sahara. Methods: The data analyzed were collected in the Sahrawi refugee camps of Algeria and in Western Sahara between 2006 and 2010. Fieldwork included semi-structured (n = 38) and retrospective (n = 12) interviews with Sahrawi refugees, nomads, and camel owners about N. perrinii and associated topics (e.g. distribution, importance for camels, camel diseases, associated grazing practices, other forage plants, etc.). Results: Askaf, as the Sahrawi call the plant, is crucial to camels' survival, providing salts and water even during dry spells. It holds a pivotal role in the Sahrawi culture, defining the geographical boundaries of the Sahrawi SES and relating the grazing territory with the taste it gives to camel milk, which support the inclusion of askaf as a main element of Sahrawi cultural identity. Conclusions: We argue that N. perrinii ties the ecology of the western Sahara desert with camel husbandry and associated livelihoods, and further with the culture and worldview of the Sahrawi nomads. We stress the keystone role that some forage plants may have in extensive pastoral SESs worldwide.},

volume={225},

pages={NA},
month={JUN 15},
abstract={Coastal communities along the U.S. West Coast experience a myriad of environmental stressors, including exposure to low pH waters exacerbated by ocean acidification (OA). This can result in ecological and social consequences, making necessary the exploration and support for locally relevant strategies to adapt to OA and other environmental changes. The shellfish aquaculture industry along the West Coast is particularly vulnerable to OA, given the negative effects of low pH on shellfish survival and growth. As such, the social-ecological system exemplified by this industry serves as an opportunity to identify and address strategies for local adaptation. Through interviews conducted with West Coast shellfish farm owners and managers ('growers'), we investigate perceptions of OA and environmental change and identify specific strategies for adaptation. We find that growers are concerned about OA, among many other environmental stressors such as marine pathogens and water temperature. However, growers are often unable to attribute changes in shellfish survival or health to these environmental factors due to a lack of data and the resources and network required to acquire and interpret these data. From these interviews, we identify a list of adaptive strategies growers employ or would like to employ to improve their overall adaptive capacity to multiple stressors (environmental, economic, political), which together, allow farms to weather periods of OA-induced stress more effectively. Very few studies to date have identified specific adaptive strategies derived directly from the communities being impacted. This work therefore fills a gap in the literature on adaptive capacity by amplifying the voices of those on the front lines of climate change and identifying explicit pathways for adaptation.},

abstract={We use the fire ecology and biogeographical patterns of Callitris intratropica, a fire-sensitive conifer, and the Asian water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis), an introduced mega-herbivore, to examine the hypothesis that the continuation of Aboriginal burning and cultural integration of buffalo contribute to greater savanna heterogeneity and diversity in central Arnhem Land (CAL) than Kakadu National Park (KNP). The `Stone Country' of the Arnhem Plateau, extending from KNP to CAL, is a globally renowned social-ecological system, managed for millennia by Bininj-Kunwok Aboriginal clans. Regional species declines have been attributed to the cessation of patchy burning by Aborigines. Whereas the KNP Stone Country is a modern wilderness, managed through prescribed burning and buffalo eradication, CAL remains a stronghold for Aboriginal management where buffalo have been culturally integrated. We surveyed the plant community and the presence of buffalo tracks among intact and fire-damaged C. intratropica groves and the savanna matrix in KNP and CAL. Aerial surveys of C. intratropica grove condition were used to examine the composition of savanna vegetation across the Stone Country. The plant community in intact C. intratropica groves had higher stem counts of shrubs and small trees and higher proportions of fire-sensitive plant species than degraded groves and the savanna matrix. A higher proportion of intact C. intratropica groves in CAL therefore indicated greater gamma diversity and habitat heterogeneity than the KNP Stone Country. Interactions among buffalo, fire, and C. intratropica suggested that buffalo also contributed to these patterns. Our results suggest linkages between ecological and cultural integrity at broad spatial scales across a complex landscape. Buffalo may provide a tool for mitigating destructive fires; however, their interactions require further study. Sustainability in the Stone Country depends upon adaptive management that rehabilitates the coupling of indigenous culture, disturbance, and natural resources.},

title={On the social dynamics of moisture recycling},
journal={EARTH SYSTEM DYNAMICS},
year={2018},
volume={9},
number={2},
pages={829-847},
month={JUL 14},
abstract={The biophysical phenomenon of terrestrial moisture recycling connects distant regions via the atmospheric branch of the water cycle. This process, whereby the land surface mediates evaporation to the atmosphere and the precipitation that falls downwind, is increasingly well-understood. However, recent studies highlight a need to consider an important and often missing dimension - the social. Here, we explore the social dynamics of three case study countries with strong terrestrial moisture recycling: Mongolia, Niger, and Bolivia. We first use the WAM-2layers moisture tracking scheme and ERA-Interim climate reanalysis, to calculate the evaporation sources for each country's precipitation, a.k.a. the precipitationshed. Second, we examine the social aspects of source and sink regions, using economic, food security, and land-use data. Third, we perform a literature review of relevant economic links, land-use policies, and land-use change for each country and its evaporation sources. The moisture-recycling analysis reveals that Mongolia, Niger, and Bolivia recycle 13, 9, and 18\% of their own moisture, respectively. Our analysis of social aspects suggests considerable heterogeneity in the social characteristics within each country relative to the societies in its corresponding evaporation sources. We synthesize our case studies and develop a set of three system archetypes that capture the core features of the moisturerecycling social-ecological systems (MRSESs): isolated, regional, and tele-coupled systems. Our key results are as follows: (a) geophysical tele-connections of atmospheric moisture are complemented by social tele-couplings forming feedback loops, and consequently, complex adaptive systems; (b) the heterogeneity of the social dynamics among our case studies renders broad generalization difficult and highlights the need for nuanced individual analysis; and, (c) there does not appear to be a single desirable or undesirable MRSES, with each archetype associated with benefits and disadvantages. This exploration of the social dimensions of moisture recycling is part of an extension of the emerging discipline of socio-hydrology and a suggestion for further exploration of new disciplines such as socio-meteorology or socio-climatology, within which the Earth system is considered as a coevolutionary social-ecological system.},

title={Bridging science and traditional knowledge to assess cumulative impacts of stressors on ecosystem health},

abstract={Cumulative environmental impacts driven by anthropogenic stressors lead to disproportionate effects on indigenous communities that are reliant on land and water resources. Understanding and counteracting these effects requires knowledge from multiple sources. Yet the combined use of Traditional Knowledge (TK) and Scientific Knowledge (SK) has both technical and philosophical hurdles to overcome, and suffers from inherently imbalanced power dynamics that can disfavour the very communities it intends to benefit. In this article, we present a `two-eyed seeing' approach for co-producing and blending knowledge about ecosystem health by using an adapted Bayesian Belief Network for the Slave River and Delta region in Canada's Northwest Territories. We highlight how bridging TM and SK with a combination of field data, interview transcripts, existing models, and expert judgement can address key questions about ecosystem health when considerable uncertainty exists. SK indicators (e.g., bird counts, mercury in fish, water depth) were graded as moderate, whereas TM indicators (e.g., bird usage, fish aesthetics, changes to water flow) were graded as being poor in comparison to the past. SK indicators were predominantly spatial (i.e., comparing to other locations) while the TK indicators were predominantly temporal (i.e., comparing across time). After being populated by 16 experts (local harvesters, Elders, governmental representatives, and scientists) using both TK and SK, the model output reported low probabilities that the social-ecological system is healthy as it used to be. We argue that it is novel and important to bridge TM and SK to address the challenges of environmental change such as the cumulative impacts of multiple stressors on ecosystems and the services they provide. This study presents a critical social-ecological tool for widening the evidence-base to a more holistic understanding of the system dynamics of multiple environmental stressors in ecosystems and for developing more effective knowledge-inclusive partnerships between indigenous communities, researchers and policy decision-makers. This represents new transformational empirical insights into how wider knowledge discourses can contribute to more effective adaptive co-management governance practices and solutions for the resilience and sustainability of ecosystems in Northern Canada and other parts of the world with strong indigenous land tenure.

abstract={The current global situation with a dominant economic development model producing social inequality, increment and intensification of urbanization has generated severe environmental degradation and an associated increase in the likelihood of pandemics. New strategies that strengthen sustainable food production are urgent in highly unequal countries as Mexico. In Mexico City, the most populated city of the country, a wetland system, named Xochimilco, still holds chinampas, a unique and ingenious food system dating from pre-Hispanic times. These days chinampas are the best example of urban sustainable agriculture production. Unfortunately, this system is under threat due to urbanization and industrial land-use changes. Among the strategies to promote sustainable modes of production and consumption is eco or green labeling, consisting of a voluntary environmental certification approach, and marketing and advertising tool, that can change producers' and consumers' behavior toward long-term sustainability. Although widely used, the benefits of green labels for producers are not always realized. This study aimed to learn more about the agro-ecological production process and commercialization challenges in Xochimilco and San Gregorio Atlapulco in Southern Mexico City to understand chinampa producers' needs and determine whether a green label can offer solutions in this vulnerable socio-ecological system, particularly suffering the effects of the COVID-19 pandemics. For this, a literature review and producers' mental model analysis based on network theory, were developed. Results show that non-resolved issues such as commercialization problems, consumers' unwillingness to pay a fair price, loss of healthy soil, and degraded water quality used for irrigation persist and can affect the benefits of a green label including to improve chinampa production and farmers' income. Farmers' current necessities comprised increasing profits, receiving financial advice to set prices of agro-ecological vegetables and production costs, among others. Under the current production and commercialization scenarios complying with the assessment cost of certification will be difficult for most producers; then, implementing the green label would probably fail to fulfill the benefits. Attending to former and persistent conflicts and satisfying chinampa producers' neglected necessities are essential before implementing any program.},

abstract={Effective approaches towards sustainability need to be informed by a diverse array of stakeholder perspectives. However, capturing these perspectives in a way that can be integrated with other forms of knowledge can represent a challenge. Here we present the first application of the conceptual framework of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) to a participatory assessment of local perspectives on nature, people and sustainability on Mount Kilimanjaro, Tanzania. This assessment was organized in the form of a participatory workshop with five different groups of stakeholders. Following this framework, we assembled information on the state of and trends in species diversity, Nature's Contributions to People (NCP), and on the main drivers of changes in species and habitats. Additionally, we gathered perspectives on the needs and opportunities for the sustainable management and conservation of natural resources from the individual to the international level. The various stakeholders agreed that both the condition and extent of the various habitats and NCP are declining. In line with available knowledge, the key direct drivers of change mentioned by the workshop participants were land use and climate change, whereas human population growth was singled out as the most important indirect driver. The most frequently suggested measures to address the observed decline in species diversity and its drivers were related to land and water management and to education and awareness raising. Yet, the stakeholder groups differed in the measures they suggested. The willingness of a diversity of knowledge holders to systematically engage in a structured discussion around all the elements of the IPBES framework provides support for its applicability in participatory workshops aimed at capturing nuanced and context-based perspectives on social-ecological systems from informed stakeholders. The application of the IPBES framework enabled the comparability needed for developing narratives of stakeholder visions that can help identify new pathways towards sustainability and guide planning while retaining the context-based nuances that remain unresolved with non-participatory methods.

abstract={The sustainability of deltas worldwide is under threat due to the consequences of global environmental change (including climate change) and human interventions in deltaic landscapes. Understanding these systems is becoming increasingly important to assess threats to and opportunities for long-term sustainable development. Here, we propose a simplified, yet inclusive social-ecological system (SES)-centered risk and vulnerability framework and a list of indicators proven to be useful in past delta assessments. In total, 236 indicators were identified through a structured review of peer-reviewed literature performed for three globally relevant deltas-the Mekong, the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna and the Amazon. These are meant to serve as a preliminary ``library{'' of potential indicators to be used for future vulnerability assessments. Based on the reviewed studies, we identified disparities in the availability of indicators to populate some of the vulnerability domains of the proposed framework, as comprehensive social-ecological assessments were seldom implemented in the past. Even in assessments explicitly aiming to capture both the social and the ecological system, there were many more indicators for social susceptibility and coping/adaptive capacities as compared to those relevant for characterizing ecosystem susceptibility or robustness. Moreover, there is a lack of multi-hazard approaches accounting for the specific vulnerability profile of sub-delta areas. We advocate for more comprehensive, truly social-ecological assessments which respond to multi-hazard settings and recognize within-delta differences in vulnerability and risk. Such assessments could make use of the proposed framework and list of indicators as a starting point and amend it with new indicators that would allow capturing the complexity as well as the multi-hazard exposure in a typical delta SES.},

abstract={This study diagnoses temporal and spatial variations in the performance of different social-ecological systems (SES) in coastal floodplain management in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta. We go beyond common pool resource management problems and address the management of local public goods. In the assessment, we consider recent developments in the framework initially developed by Elinor Ostrom. The main variables of the framework that we use are resource systems, the environment, the governance system and actors. The focal SES is defined based on guiding questions relating to the definition of the key problem, system boundaries, and action situations. According to our results, the performance of resource systems and the environment deteriorated in 1960-79 compared to the performance prior to 1960. The condition reached a low point during 1980-1999 but improved slightly after 1999. The horizontal network structure of local governance was active until 1960. Due to the introduction of the `tidal river management' approach in the 90 s, the performance of the resource system and the environment has slightly improved, as has the involvement of government and non-government organizations. Our results also show that overall SES performance is comparatively better <in the case of locally managed floodplains than it is for those managed by government agencies. Our new approaches, such as the recent development of the diagnostic framework, the guiding questions for defining focal SES, and application of the framework to local public goods can potentially be used in the fields of sustainability science and SES science. The qualitative performance of each of the selected indicators is useful for identifying intervention options to achieve a sustainable outcome for the coastal floodplain SES.},

journal={APPLIED GEOGRAPHY},
year={2022},
volume={145},

pages={NA},
month={AUG},
abstract={Theoretical and methodological approaches of social-ecological system's vulnerability provide a new perspective for the sustainable development of arid areas. However, the spatial distribution heterogeneity of internal ele-ments of vulnerability has always been ignored in current academic research and policy practice. Especially in low-exposure but high-vulnerability areas, it is more urgent to explore the vulnerability-causing factors and construct the response capacity. Therefore, according to the concept of vulnerability and its internal element relationship, this study proposes an analysis method for the spatial-temporal heterogeneity of exposure risk and vulnerability. With the aid of GIS, while assessing the spatial-temporal evolution of the overall vulnerability of the Minqin Oasis since the comprehensive management of Shiyang River Basin, we pay more attention to the spatial-temporal heterogeneity of the internal elements of vulnerability. Then applying the stepwise regression and geographically weighted regression, the article further analyzed the intrinsic reasons for spatial-temporal heterogeneity of SES's vulnerability and exposure risk. The results are as follows. 1) The vulnerability in Min-qin County from 2008 to 2016 was relatively low and showed an evolutionary trend of increased and then decreased. In addition, the vulnerability area was high in the Quanshan and Dam Districts and low in the Lake District; 2) the spatial-temporal heterogeneity of system exposure risk and vulnerability was significant and gradually reduced; and 3) the five main factors affecting spatial-temporal heterogeneity of the vulnerability of SES in Minqin Oasis include: per capita cultivated area, disaster-affected area, domestic water consumption, financial savings, and afforestation area. Finally, we proposed targeted recommendations for effective adaptive management and sustainable development for exposure-vulnerability heterogeneous regions.},

abstract={Climate change is expected to adversely affect the crop yields and food security for many smallholder farmers in the tropics unless adaptive measures are implemented. Agroforestry ecosystem services, such as micro-climate buffering, have received growing attention from the academic and policy communities for alleviating the negative impacts of climate change on smallholders. These benefits imply that agroforestry could offer a suitable measure for adaptation to climate change. However, whether agroforestry systems themselves succumb to the adverse effects of climate change is often less studied in the agroforestry literature. Consequently, less is known about how climate change will impact agroforests. We conducted a systematic review, which included an evidence quality assessment, to examine the impacts of climate change on tropical agroforestry systems (TAFS). Based primarily on studies undertaking biophysical approaches, we found that climate change negatively impacts TAFS by reducing tree growth, intensifying tree-crop resource competition and reducing crop yields. However, the impacts on smallholder farmers are less clear due to limited evidence in the relevant literature. We found that the evidence supporting our findings is mostly ``robust ``, although ``least robust `` strength evidence was also commonly found. We conclude that to improve understanding of how climate change could affect the performance of TAFS as a social ecological system, more interdisciplinary studies are required. Furthermore, to improve the quality of evidence in the research field, studies should explore using mountain elevation gradients for climate analog analysis to perform the most robust study designs. We provide an interdisciplinary conceptual model, which considers the interactions and feedbacks between TAFS components noted from our review to predict the response of ecosystem services provisioning and farmers' wellbeing to climate change, to guide interdisciplinary studies using climate analog analysis.},

title={Analysing potato late blight control as a social-ecological system using fuzzy cognitive mapping},
journal={AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT},
year={2016},
volume={36},
number={2},
pages={NA},
month={JUN},
abstract={Potato late blight, caused by Phytophthora infestans, is one of the main diseases in potato production, causing major losses in yield. Applying environmentally harmful fungicides is the prevailing and classical method for controlling late blight, thus contaminating food and water. There is therefore a need for innovative research approaches to produce food sustainably. Here, we used a systems approach to identify sustainable management strategies for disease control in potato production in the Netherlands. We focussed not only on ecological processes, the classical approach, but also on decision-making concerning disease management. For that, we performed a literature study, stakeholder interviews and modelling using fuzzy cognitive mapping. Interviews were carried out with farmers, representatives of breeding companies and experts. The fuzzy cognitive map allows to identify major concepts and their influence on late blight management. Three management scenarios were analysed using the fuzzy cognitive map. Results show that published research on the control of potato late blight focusses on agronomic practices, plant breeding for resistance to late blight and chemical-based disease suppression. Farmers are strongly influenced by corporate (such as traders, breeders and retail) and public institutes and policies, each pushing their own objectives and interests. The fuzzy cognitive map showed that social and ecological processes are tightly related. The scenario analysis showed that increasing stakeholder cooperation and a change in market demands towards resistant cultivars could improve sustainability of late blight management. In contrast, policies restricting the use of fungicides would result in increased disease severity if no alternative strategies were implemented. Adoption of such strategies would require social-institutional support and facilitation. We conclude that our systems approach improves the understanding of the system dynamics which is necessary for developing and deploying effective strategies for controlling P. infestans.},

abstract={An international effort to restore contaminated areas across the Great Lakes has been underway for over 50 years. Although experts have increasingly recognized the inherent connections between ecological conditions and community level benefits, Great Lakes community revitalization continues to be a broad and complex topic, lacking a comprehensive definition. The purpose of this study was to generate a tes -table ``AOC-Revitalization Framework{''} for linking remediation and restoration success, represented by Beneficial Use Impairment (BUI) removal in U.S. Great Lakes Areas of Concern (AOC), to community revi-talization. Using directed content analysis, we conducted a literature review and identified 433 potential revitalization metrics and indicators and grouped them into 15 broader community revitalization attri-butes to develop the following definition of Great Lakes community revitalization: ``locally driven commu-nity resurgence resulting in resilient and equitable enhancements to social, economic, and environmental community structures.{''} We surveyed experts within the Great Lakes AOC program on the likelihood reme-diation and restoration success, would positively impact revitalization attributes. Focus groups triangu-lated survey results. Results identified BUI removal was expected to positively affect revitalization, but the type of revitalization outcome was based on the BUI being removed. The AOC-Revitalization Framework is the first to empirically outline these possible linkages, providing a clear testable structure for future research; it can be used to better understand how environmental improvements are or are not leading to community revitalization and more accurately identify components of revitalization impacted, thus supporting more equitable representation, communication, and measurement of the relationship.

abstract={Our research addresses the gap in scientific research on the fine-grain spatial patterns and social-ecological interactions of land use and agrobiodiversity. The spatial dimension of agrobiodiversity dynamics potentially strengthens the social-ecological resilience and food security of smallholders by buffering risk and vulnerability. Our research integrates the scientific theories, concepts, and methods of spatial externalities, social-ecological interactions, geospatial land and global change sciences, and political ecology. We designed a case study of the Arbieto-Tarata landscape in the Bolivian Andes that comprises a globally significant agrobiodiversity hot spot of Andean maize. The Arbieto-Tarata landscape, which contains nearly 8000 fields at 2500-2800 masl, is representative of mixed-use smallholder agri-food systems amid global changes. Our research predicts spatial spillover and edge effects of combined social and environmental factors leading to the clustering of same-crop fields. Findings reveal significant levels of the predicted clustering between 2006 and 2012. The degree of this clustering is found to differ among geographic and environmental sub-areas reflecting fine-grain variation of local causal linkages. Extra-local causal linkages include high levels of migration, water resource shortages, and urbanization. Results show the influences of informal and formal coordination in the spatial clustering of same-crop fields. This field-level coordination improves the efficiency of resource allocations and lowers costs of production. It enables the viability of high-agrobiodiversity Andean maize in smallholder land use and agri-food systems amid global changes. The article discusses the broader policy and scientific implications of these findings including scaling up and support of the social-ecological resilience of agrobiodiversity globally.},

title={Modeling Soft Institutional Change and the Improvement of Freshwater Governance in the Coastal Zone},
journal={ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
year={2011},
volume={16},

abstract={The contribution of soft institutional change to improve freshwater governance in the coastal zone will be examined. Freshwater management seeks to reduce losses due to overexploitation of the common-pool resources provided by river catchments and their associated ecosystems. Due to the complexity of the governance system, improving the performance of one coastal social-ecological system means searching for the appropriate ``soft{''} institutional change. In the Pertuis Charentais region, increasing scarcity of freshwater in summer threatens the health of the coastal ecosystem and the sustainability of human activities, which depend on the use of natural resources. The allocation of freshwater among competing uses or concerns is a core issue for integrated coastal zone management. To address this issue, we have constructed an analytical framework that combines the ecosystem services approach with the institutional analysis of common-pool resources, and have developed an integrated simulation tool based on the system dynamic modeling approach. Freshwater scarcity generates three kinds of user conflict: (1) conflict between two extractive uses of freshwater (irrigation and drinking water), (2) conflicts between extractive uses (provisioning services) and other services (support, regulatory, and cultural) provided by freshwater, and (3) competition within a given activity sector (agriculture or shellfish farming). Participation by local managers led to the identification of realistic soft institutional changes that might mitigate conflicts and improve the governance system. These possible institutional changes were then integrated as fixed exogenous parameters in the simulation model. The simulated scenarios suggest that innovative collective arrangements involving farmers could be an alternative to other more restrictive top-down measures. This participatory experiment also illustrates the potential of social-ecological modeling for exploring acceptable new institutional arrangements.},

title={Combining ecohydrologic and transition probability-based modeling to simulate vegetation dynamics in a semi-arid rangeland},

abstract={Drylands support pastoralist social-ecological systems around the world. Ecological function in these water-limited environments frequently depends on tightly coupled, nonlinear interactions between water, soil, vegetation, and herbivores. Numerous complexity-based approaches have modeled localized ecohydrological feedbacks to yield insights into dryland landscape organization and emergent dynamics. The relevance of these models to management and sustainability continues to increase as researchers incorporate ecological processes at multiple scales and social-ecological variables like herding practices. However, many processes vary in their importance depending on ecological context, so there is a continuing need to construct models tailored to different contexts. We developed a model for semiarid rangelands that experience highly variable rainfall, substantial Hortonian runoff during rain events, patchy vegetation structure, and grazing-influenced patch transitions. The model couples an existing, mechanistic cellular automata model of hillslope water balance with a dynamic vegetation model in which probabilistic transitions between bare, annual grass, perennial grass patches depend on soil moisture and grazing intensity. The model was parameterized based on a field site in Kenya, from which we had empirical hydrological measurements and several years of patch-to-hillslope scale measurements of vegetation structure. The model domain is a 100 x 100 grid of 2 x 2 m cells, it simulates seasonal cycles of growing seasons followed by dry seasons, and it computes daily soil moisture based on stochastic rainfall forcings. Patch type transitions can occur twice during each seasonal cycle: at the end of the growing season, with probabilities based on average growing-season soil moisture availability; and at the end of the dry season, with probabilities based on grazing intensity and antecedent growing-season soil moisture. By parameterizing grazing intensity as a per-patch impact, it can be interpreted as the degree of forage depletion at which a herder decides to leave the area. We conducted a series of simulation experiments, principally altering runoff channelization and grazing intensity. The model generated plausible vegetation dynamics across the range of grazing intensities simulated. Vegetation cover fluctuated seasonally,. but never collapsed completely, even at the highest grazing intensity. At low to intermediate grazing, we observed multi-decadal switches in fractional perennial cover, triggered by periods of below- or above-average rainfall. At low to intermediate grazing intensities, we noted emergent spatial patterning in the form of a step-like increase in vegetation density in the lower half of the domain. With a vegetation patch transitions governed by mechanistic water balance dynamics as well as grazing intensities that represent herder decision-making, the model holds great potential for further explorations of how land use, climate, and spatial heterogeneity affect the functioning of a dryland pastoralist social-ecological system.

year={2022},
volume={42},

month={OCT},
abstract={In Guadeloupe, a French overseas region, civil society is calling for an agroecological transition (AET) to obtain access to healthy agricultural products following a major ecological scandal caused by a persistent pesticide that contaminated water and agricultural soils. To support such a transition, we tested a five-step methodological framework designed to enable farmers to describe and explore scenarios in farming systems, socio-technical systems, and social-ecological systems. This is one of the first operational methodological tools to build scenarios and action plans for an AET taking into account simultaneous changes in these three systems. We first surveyed 63 farmers and positioned their farming systems along an AET gradient using the Efficiency-Substitution-Redesign framework. In the second step, a sub-sample of 18 farmers, who represented diverse farming system types, individually defined AET scenarios at the level of their own farms. We then applied a farm simulation model to evaluate the technical and economic performance of each scenario. The third step involved analyzing the types of social networks used by 45 farmers to share information and promote technical, commercial, and social exchanges to implement agroecological practices in their territory. In the fourth step, we worked with a group of 15 farmers and 10 researchers in a participatory workshop to characterize the natural resources, their associated services and disservices, and the actors involved. In the last step, the farmers and researchers defined an action plan for the AET in their territory. Our results suggest that AET is understood by farmers to be a gradual and multiscale process involving the co-creation of knowledge, technical solutions, and organizational changes. An initial outcome of the process tested was a shift in the stance of researchers. Their focus shifted from experiments conducted on-station toward experiments managed by farmers to co-produce knowledge on the viability of agroecological practices under their own specific conditions, triggering discussions between stakeholders (such as advisers, policy makers, smallholders, and larger farmers) in the territory.},

title={Operationalizing resilience for adaptive coral reef management under global environmental change},
journal={GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY},

volume={21},
number={1},
pages={48-61},
month={JAN},
abstract={Cumulative pressures from global climate and ocean change combined with multiple regional and local-scale stressors pose fundamental challenges to coral reef managers worldwide. Understanding how cumulative stressors affect coral reef vulnerability is critical for successful reef conservation now and in the future. In this review, we present the case that strategically managing for increased ecological resilience (capacity for stress resistance and recovery) can reduce coral reef vulnerability (risk of net decline) up to a point. Specifically, we propose an operational framework for identifying effective management levers to enhance resilience and support management decisions that reduce reef vulnerability. Building on a system understanding of biological and ecological processes that drive resilience of coral reefs in different environmental and socio-economic settings, we present an Adaptive Resilience-Based management (ARBM) framework and suggest a set of guidelines for how and where resilience can be enhanced via management interventions. We argue that press-type stressors (pollution, sedimentation, overfishing, ocean warming and acidification) are key threats to coral reef resilience by affecting processes underpinning resistance and recovery, while pulse-type (acute) stressors (e.g. storms, bleaching events, crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks) increase the demand for resilience. We apply the framework to a set of example problems for Caribbean and Indo-Pacific reefs. A combined strategy of active risk reduction and resilience support is needed, informed by key management objectives, knowledge of reef ecosystem processes and consideration of environmental and social drivers. As climate change and ocean acidification erode the resilience and increase the vulnerability of coral reefs globally, successful adaptive management of coral reefs will become increasingly difficult. Given limited resources, on-the-ground solutions are likely to focus increasingly on actions that support resilience at finer spatial scales, and that are tightly linked to ecosystem goods and services.},

title={Transition from subsistence grazing to nature-based recreation: A nuanced view of land abandonment in a mountain social-ecological system, southwestern Cape, South Africa},

abstract={Over the last 50 years, studies have shown a decline in the use of mountain lands, a phenomenon termed land abandonment. We investigate the causal mechanisms of land use change in a mountain catchment important for regional water supplies in the southwestern Cape of South Africa. Uniquely, we include nature-based recreational land use types typically excluded from land abandonment studies. We repeated a structured questionnaire originally conducted with landowners 38 years previously and analysed orthoimages from 1948, 1972 and 2014. To identify and contextualise causal mechanisms of change we used thematic analysis and generated narratives from in-depth interviews with landowners. The land use system in 1948 and 1972 was dominated by livestock based, subsistence agriculture and small-scale farming. This transitioned to agricultural intensification on the lowlands and small portions of the mountains and the utilisation of mountains for non-economic nature-based recreation and ecotourism. The use of frequent small, low intensity-controlled fires was prevalent in the past. More recently, fires have been actively suppressed resulting in the build-up of biomass and the development of infrequent, extensive, high-intensity wildfires. Land use change in the mountains was driven primarily by socioeconomic drivers, including socio-economic benefits related to globalisation and economic growth, and not by concerns over land degradation or resource depletion. Our findings support evidence that shows that people?s responses to economic opportunities drive local determinants of land use change and highlights the importance of perceptions in driving land use transitions. We show that existing models of land abandonment are likely overly deterministic in that they do not consider social and cultural factors that may cause a landowner to continue using their land for semi-economic or non-economic reasons. While there is merit in large-scale remote sensing studies, we emphasise the importance of using mixed remote sensing and social science methods for informing models of land use change.},

title={Comparison of social-ecological resilience between two grassland management patterns driven by grassland land contract policy in the Maqu, Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau},

abstract={Embraced for decision-making, resilience has evolved as a meaningful term in areas such as ecology, the economy and society. After a policy of grassland contracts was implemented on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, two grassland management patterns evolved: the multi-household management pattern (MMP) and the single-household management pattern (SMP). Within a resilience-driven perspective, this study compared the outcomes of these grassland management patterns by measuring their effects on the resilience of grazing, ecological, economic and social systems. Resilience indicators for each of the four systems were: grazing system (grazing space, transhumance, water source and reproduction); ecological system (vegetation including cover, biomass, species richness and soil properties including pH, organic carbon, total nitrogen and total phosphorus); economic system (income, expenditure and infrastructure) and the social system (health, assistance, social relations, cultural inheritance and institutional arrangements). In order to provide a social-ecological resilience framework for the two grassland management patterns, a decision support tool was applied to approximately gauge the resilience of each indicator. The results showed that each of the four systems under the MMP had a greater degree of resilience than the SMP, and that the overall resilience of the MMP was estimated at 5.8 units compared to about - 5.8 units for the SMP. The relative success of the MMP was seen to rest largely on the maintenance of traditional management practices, social networks, trust and the low cost and high efficiency of informal institutions, which acted to reduce the risk of unsustainable development of ecological and social systems. The important take-home lesson from this study is that contracting of grasslands to private entities on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, and in the rest of the world where similar land management practices exist, must be undertaken with caution.},

abstract={Increasing livestock densities on limited grazing areas in African savannahs lead to resource degradation through overgrazing, aggravated by drought. Assessing herd management strategies over longer periods at landscape scale is important to propose options for sustainable land use. This requires an understanding of processes related to hydrology, nutrient cycling, herd movement, pasture degradation, and animal resilience that involve dynamic soil-plant-animal interactions and human decisions about stocking rates, livestock purchases and sales.We present the coupled model system MPMAS-LUCIA-LIVSIM (MLL), the combination of a spatially explicit agent-based model for human decision-making (MPMAS), a spatially distributed landscape model for water flows, nutrient cycles and plant growth (LUCIA), and a herd model (LIVSIM) representing grazing, body weight, nutrition and excreta of individual animals. MLL represents daily vegetation growth in response to grazing and organic inputs, monthly animal performance influenced by forage availability and quality, and herders' man-agement in response to resource status. New modules for selective grazing, resprouting of pasture, herd move-ment and model coupling were developed for MLL.The test case of a pastoral system in the Ethiopian Borana region demonstrates the capabilities of MLL to simulate key soil-plant-animal-human interactions under climate-related management scenarios with varying access to grazing land, changing cattle prices and different spending / saving behaviour of herders. 20-year simulations showed the negative impact of consecutive drought years on vegetation biomass, on herd devel-opment and movement and how reserving grazing areas for dry seasons could mitigate overgrazing and improve income. Seasonality and drought response of vegetation growth, selective grazing of different plant parts, resprouting after grazing, calving intervals, milk yields and lactation in response to forage supply and quality as well as herder reactions to shocks were plausibly represented.Building upon this successful proof-of-concept, MLL can be used to identify robust management options for improved grazing systems in savannahs in follow-up research.},

abstract={Non-technical summaryThe United Nations' sustainable development goals (SDGs) articulate societal aspirations for people and our planet. Many scientists have criticised the SDGs and some have suggested that a better understanding of the complex interactions between society and the environment should underpin the next global development agenda. We further this discussion through the theory of social-ecological resilience, which emphasises the ability of systems to absorb, adapt, and transform in the face of change. We determine the strengths of the current SDGs, which should form a basis for the next agenda, and identify key gaps that should be filled. Technical summaryThe United Nations' sustainable development goals (SDGs) are past their halfway point and the next global development agenda will soon need to be developed. While laudable, the SDGs have received strong criticism from many, and scholars have proposed that adopting complex adaptive or social-ecological system approaches would increase the effectiveness of the agenda. Here we dive deeper into these discussions to explore how the theory of social-ecological resilience could serve as a strong foundation for the next global sustainable development agenda. We identify the strengths and weaknesses of the current SDGs by determining which of the 169 targets address each of 43 factors affecting social-ecological resilience that we have compiled from the literature. The SDGs with the strongest connections to social-ecological resilience are the environment-focus goals (SDGs 2, 6, 13, 14, 15), which are also the goals consistently under-prioritised in the implementation of the current agenda. In terms of the 43 factors affecting social-ecological resilience, the SDG strengths lie in their communication, inclusive decision making, financial support, regulatory incentives, economic diversity, and transparency in governance and law. On the contrary, ecological factors of resilience are seriously lacking in the SDGs, particularly with regards to scale, cross-scale interactions, and non-stationarity. Social media summaryThe post-2030 agenda should build on strengths of SDGs 2, 6, 13, 14, 15, and fill gaps in scale, variability, and feedbacks.},

year={2014},
volume={19},
number={1},
pages={NA},
month={NA},
abstract={Climate change presents new challenges for the management of social-ecological systems and the ecosystem services they provide. Although the instrument of payments for ecosystem services (PES) has emerged as a promising tool to safeguard or enhance the provision of ecosystem services (ES), little attention has been paid to the potential role of PES in climate change adaptation. As an external stressor climate change has an impact on the social-ecological system in which PES takes place, including the various actors taking part in the PES scheme. Following a short description of the conceptual link between PES and adaptation to climate change, we provide practical insights into the relationship between PES and adaptation to climate change by presenting results from a case study of a rural watershed in Kenya. Drawing upon the results of a participatory vulnerability assessment among potential ecosystem service providers in Sasumua watershed north of Nairobi, we show that PES can play a role in enhancing adaptation to climate change by influencing certain elements of adaptive capacity and incentivizing adaptation measures. In addition, trade-offs and synergies between proposed measures under PES and adaptation to climate change are identified. Results show that although it may not be possible to establish PES schemes based on water utilities as the sole source of financing, embedding PES in a wider adaptation framework creates an opportunity for the development of watershed PES schemes in Africa and ensures their sustainability. We conclude that there is a need to embed PES in a wider institutional framework and that extra financial resources are needed to foster greater integration between PES and adaptation to climate change. This can be achieved through scaling up PES by bringing in other buyers and additional ecosystem services. PES can achieve important coadaptation benefits, but for more effective adaptation outcomes it needs to be combined with vulnerability assessments and climate scenarios to ensure that these are realized and potential trade-offs between PES measures and adaptation measures minimized.},

abstract={Agricultural systems are increasingly considered complex adaptive systems. They are dependent on the integrated nature of biophysical and social sub-systems, continuously adapt to changing conditions and often display non-linear responses to various drivers of change at multiple scales. This research applied the lens of complex adaptive systems theory to analyze current and historical drivers of change and adaptation pathways of agricultural systems to increased salinity intrusion in coastal areas of the Red River and Mekong deltas in Vietnam since 1975, The analysis is based on 27 in-depth interviews with officials of local and national authorities as well as 198 semi-structured interviews and 11 focus group discussions conducted with farmers along three salinity transects in both deltas in 2015-2016. The results show that a dynamic interplay and feedback of various drivers of change such as policy intervention, farmers' desire for profit maximization, changing salinity conditions, and technological development at different levels of the deltaic social-ecological system have shaped the changes and adaptations in agricultural systems over the last decades. In response to increased salinity intrusion, as exemplified by the historic salinity levels recorded in the Mekong Delta in 2015-2016, various adaptation options have been considered. These include adaptations that would lock-in agricultural production in particular systems or constrain changes in others, which is potentially problematic in light of the high uncertainty related to future changes. The study recognizes the need to apply both incremental and transformative changes and select adaptation pathways which allow for continuous change or that are reversible in order to avoid lock-ins and address future challenges. Additionally, attention should be drawn to interactions and feedbacks in future changes within and across adaptation pathways in order to prevent further increases in salinity intrusion and lock-in effects in agricultural systems within the deltas.},

title={Drivers of Productivity Trends in Cork Oak Woodlands over the Last 15 Years},
journal={REMOTE SENSING},
year={2016},
volume={8},
number={6},
pages={NA},
month={JUN},
abstract={Higher biodiversity leads to more productive ecosystems which, in turn, supports more biodiversity. Ongoing global changes affect ecosystem productivity and, therefore, are expected to affect productivity-biodiversity relationships. However, the magnitude of these relationships may be affected by baseline biodiversity and its lifeforms. Cork oak (Quercus suber) woodlands are a highly biodiverse Mediterranean ecosystem managed for cork extraction; as a result of this management cork oak woodlands may have both tree and shrub canopies, just tree and just shrub canopies, and just grasslands. Trees, shrubs, and grasses may respond differently to climatic variables and their combination may, therefore, affect measurements of productivity and the resulting productivity-biodiversity relationships. Here, we asked whether the relationship between productivity and climate is affected by the responses of trees, shrubs, and grasses in cork oak woodlands in Southern Portugal. To answer this question, we linked a 15-year time series of Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) derived from Landsat satellites to micrometeorological data to assess the relationship between trends in EVI and climate. Between 2000 and 2013 we observed an overall decrease in EVI. However, EVI increased over cork oaks and decreased over shrublands. EVI trends were strongly positively related to changes in relative humidity and negatively related to temperature. The intra-annual EVI cycle of grasslands and sparse cork oak woodland without understorey (savannah-like ecosystem) had higher variation than the other land-cover types. These results suggest that oaks and shrubs have different responses to changes in water availability, which can be either related to oak physiology, to oaks being either more resilient or having lagged responses to changes in climate, or to the fact that shrublands start senesce earlier than oaks. Our results also suggest that in the future EVI could improve because the rate of increase in minimum EVI is greater than the rate of decrease in maximum EVI, and that this is contingent on management of the shrub understorey as it affects the rate of decrease in maximum EVI. This will be the challenge for the persistence of cork oak woodlands, their associated biodiversity and social-ecological system.},

title={Integrating social and ecological data to model metapopulation dynamics in coupled human and natural systems},
journal={ECOLOGY},
year={2019},
volume={100},
number={6},
pages={NA},
month={JUN},
abstract={Understanding how metapopulations persist in dynamic working landscapes requires assessing the behaviors of key actors that change patches as well as intrinsic factors driving turnover. Coupled human and natural systems (CHANS) research uses a multidisciplinary approach to identify the key actors, processes, and feedbacks that drive metapopulation and landscape dynamics. We describe a framework for modeling metapopulations in CHANS that integrates ecological and social data by coupling stochastic patch occupancy models of metapopulation dynamics with agent-based models of land-use change. We then apply this framework to metapopulations of the threatened black rail (Laterallus jamaicensis) and widespread Virginia rail (Rallus limicola) that inhabit patchy, irrigation-fed wetlands in the rangelands of the California Sierra Nevada foothills. We collected data from five diverse sources (rail occupancy surveys, land-use change mapping, a survey of landowner decision making, climate and reservoir databases, and mosquito trapping and West Nile virus testing) and integrated them into an agent-based stochastic patch occupancy model. We used the model to (1) quantify the drivers of metapopulation dynamics, and the potential interactions and feedbacks among them; (2) test predictions of the behavior of metapopulations in dynamic working landscapes; and (3) evaluate the impact of three policy options on metapopulation persistence (irrigation district water cutbacks during drought, incentives for landowners to create wetlands, and incentives for landowners to protect wetlands). Complex metapopulation dynamics emerged when landscapes functioned as CHANS, highlighting the importance of integrating human activities and other ecological processes into metapopulation models. Rail metapopulations were strongly top-down regulated by precipitation, and the black rail's decade-long decline was caused by the combination of West Nile virus and drought. Theoretical predictions of the two metapopulations' responses to dynamic landscapes and incentive programs were complicated by heterogeneity in patch quality and CHANS couplings, respectively. Irrigation cutbacks during drought posed a serious extinction risk that neither incentive policy effectively ameliorated.},

title={The development of an integrated systems model for balancing coral reef health, land management and tourism risks on the Great Barrier Reef},

abstract={A prototype Bayesian belief network (BBN) is described that provides catchment-to-reef integration of previously unlinked components of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) social-ecological system. The BBN is developed to help decision-makers understand the socio-economic trade-offs associated with managing for resilient reef communities given the threat posed by climate change. The probability of severe coral bleaching events increases with climate-driven increases in surface ocean temperatures, but this threat is synergistically linked to the water quality within the GBR lagoon. Improved inshore water quality requires the adoption of `best practice' catchment management, which may incur considerable cost to the agricultural industry. However, this cost is countered by the associated benefit of safeguarding future reef tourism. The aim of this work is to develop a prototype model capable of investigating these key system linkages only. The BBN formalises this socio-ecological cost-benefit analysis within a risk assessment framework. This aids the difficult task of prioritising alternative management actions. The complexity of the problem represents a challenging modelling task with a large envelope of solutions needing to be represented, each with its own scale and configuration of `wins' and `losses' across diverse system sectors. To simplify the modelling task, we specifically targeted key elements of the reef, agriculture, and tourism sectors and then focused on developing the most parsimonious set of cross-sector linkages to generate an integrated systems model. We focus here on the approach used, as results are not yet available. The diverse nature of the individual sectors presented a major challenge for model construction, not least because the causal (i.e. dependence) relationships within individual sectors exist at different levels of understanding and scientific development, as do the relationships between the separate sectors. Furthermore, the data that captures the functional behaviour of each sector (as well as cross-sector interactions) exists as an eclectic mix of simulated, empirical and subjectively-derived information. Fortunately, the adopted BBN approach is capable of resolving these system domain and data uncertainties in a transparent fashion, which includes the assigning of error estimates for the alternate system trade-off scenarios. By making these trade-off uncertainties explicit, the resultant framework provides decision-makers with a rational (i.e. quantitative) method to resolve catchment level questions such as; Which reef protection target provides the lowest risk and maximum benefit for the local community? How soon must reef protection targets be realised in order to maximise cross-sector benefits? Can win/win strategies be pursued with acceptable levels of certainty? For a given reef protection target, what are the costs to industry and how are they distributed across sectors? What are the risks and benefits of maximum and `do nothing' reef protection targets, and how are these risks and benefits distributed? Are the economic benefits to tourism likely to be large enough to balance economic losses to agriculture? Are economic losses in any sector likely to exist at levels that substantially reduce community wellbeing? What are the most influential system components, and are they amenable to policy development? The framework is currently under review by participants. Once the structure is verified, the prototype will be parameterised and evaluated.},

abstract={Pastoral systems are known to be prone to social, political and ecological uncertainties. Traditional ecological knowledge that the pastoral communities hold around their bio-physical environment has been a key to cope with stressors and adapt to the rapid socio-economic changes. We examined traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) on livestock and resource management, factors influencing livestock production and concurrent changes in an agro-pastoral system. We used mixed methods by conducting 44 semi-structured interviews, 10 key informants' interviews and resource mapping in five villages of Upper Spiti Landscape, western Himalaya. Our specific objectives were to (i) document TEK on livestock diet and management and (ii) understand the drivers and consequences of the change in the agro-pastoral society and associated traditional knowledge system. The herders of the study area possessed extensive knowledge of livestock diet and fodder species preference. They used this knowledge to optimize livestock grazing in pastures during summers and to fulfil the nutrient requirements of livestock species during stall feeding in winters. Seasonally, the aspect, altitude and accessibility of the pasture influenced the rotational use of pastures. In contrast, the quality of forage and water availability, distance of the pasture from village and threats from predators influenced the selection of grazing areas daily. There are evident changes in the livestock production system and signs that TEK is eroding in the region. Primary contributing factors to loss of TEK include changing aspirations of local people. These aspirations were related to employment in lucrative alternative options like cash crops and tourism, out-migration of the young generation for higher education and the arrival of immigrant labourers as new actors in livestock management. Livestock numbers in the study site remained dynamic between the year 2003-2016 owing to the substantive social and ecological changes. Our results suggest that while the traditional knowledge persists, the signs of erosion in traditional knowledge and associated changes in current herding practices are evident. We argue that recent changes in the pastoral social-ecological system, especially loss of TEK and non-traditional rearing practices, due to increasing dependence on immigrant labourers, may have negative implications for livestock production, rangeland health and wildlife conservation goals in the long run. Long term site-specific studies on livestock production and associated knowledge would be critical for adaptive rangeland management and policies.},

abstract={Background Large-river decision-makers are charged with maintaining diverse ecosystem services through unprecedented social-ecological transformations as climate change and other global stressors intensify. The interconnected, dendritic habitats of rivers, which often demarcate jurisdictional boundaries, generate complex management challenges. Here, we explore how the Resist-Accept-Direct (RAD) framework may enhance large-river management by promoting coordinated and deliberate responses to social-ecological trajectories of change. The RAD framework identifies the full decision space of potential management approaches, wherein managers may resist change to maintain historical conditions, accept change toward different conditions, or direct change to a specified future with novel conditions. In the Upper Mississippi River System, managers are facing social-ecological transformations from more frequent and extreme high-water events. We illustrate how RAD-informed basin-, reach-, and site-scale decisions could: (1) provide cross-spatial scale framing; (2) open the entire decision space of potential management approaches; and (3) enhance coordinated inter-jurisdictional management in response to the trajectory of the Upper Mississippi River hydrograph.Results The RAD framework helps identify plausible long-term trajectories in different reaches (or subbasins) of the river and how the associated social-ecological transformations could be managed by altering site-scale conditions. Strategic reach-scale objectives may reprioritize how, where, and when site conditions could be altered to contribute to the basin goal, given the basin's plausible trajectories of change (e.g., by coordinating action across sites to alter habitat connectivity, diversity, and redundancy in the river mosaic).Conclusions When faced with long-term systemic transformations (e.g., > 50 years), the RAD framework helps explicitly consider whether or when the basin vision or goals may no longer be achievable, and direct options may open yet unconsidered potential for the basin. Embedding the RAD framework in hierarchical decision-making clarifies that the selection of actions in space and time should be derived from basin-wide goals and reach-scale objectives to ensure that site-scale actions contribute effectively to the larger river habitat mosaic. Embedding the RAD framework in large-river decisions can provide the necessary conduit to link flexibility and innovation at the site scale with stability at larger scales for adaptive governance of changing social-ecological systems.},

abstract={CONTEXT: Crop diversification is now well-recognised as a strong lever to address the environmental challenges currently faced by agriculture. Connecting and fostering local exchanges between specialised arable crop and livestock farms can support the diversification of crops and relocate animal feeding with local protein (vs. soya supplements). However, the trade-offs and synergies between individual and collective objectives and perfor-mances generated by this system are still largely unknown. Innovative tools that consider the spatiotemporal heterogeneity underpinning the daily functioning of farms are needed to explore the implications of exchange scenarios. OBJECTIVES: To assess self-sufficiency, sustainability and vulnerability at the farm, group (arable vs. livestock) and territorial levels considering the baseline situation and scenarios that increase synergy between arable and livestock farms. METHODS: We demonstrated the utility of using MAELIA, a spatial agent-based integrated modelling framework, to support iterative design and assessment of self-sufficiency, sustainability and vulnerability of such scenarios. MAELIA was applied to model a collective of five arable and two livestock farmers in western France. In a participatory approach, scientists, agricultural advisers and the farmers co-designed three possible scenarios of legume exchanges. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Only the most ambitious scenario based on strong collaboration allowed farmers to reach local protein self-sufficiency while reducing the variability in five of the seven indicators used to assess farm performances. Meeting livestock farms' demand for legumes had a positive influence on socio-economic performance at the territorial level, including an increase in the mean gross margin (of 71 (sic)/ha; 4\% higher), decrease in the use of nitrogen fertiliser (of ca. 21 kg N/ha; 11\% lower) and decrease in labour time (of ca. 12 min/ha; 5\% lower). No major trade-offs between self-sufficiency and vulnerability were observed. However, there were distinct individual performances related to the degree of changes imposed on each farm. SIGNIFICANCE: We show that by reducing the dependence to external inputs, these systems are promising al-ternatives to an environmentally sustainable, resilient and economically viable agroecological transition. The development of dedicated institutional support for direct bilateral or multilateral agreements, and specific financial and technical support would encourage farmers to join such initiatives and redesign their farming systems.},

title={Impact of Climate Change on Paddy Farming in the Village Tank Cascade Systems of Sri Lanka},
journal={SUSTAINABILITY},
year={2023},
volume={15},
number={12},
pages={NA},
month={JUN},
abstract={Consequences of global climate change are predicted to increase risks to crop production in the future. However, the possible broader impact of climate change on social-ecological systems still needs to be evaluated. Therefore, the present study focuses on one such globally important agricultural social-ecological system referred to as the Village Tank Cascade System (VTCS) in the dry zone of Sri Lanka. The VTCS has considerable potential to withstand seasonal climate variability mainly through continuous supply of water by the village tank storage throughout the year. The current study aimed to investigate trends of climate variability and possible impacts on paddy production in the North and North-central VTCS zone. Observed and projected rainfall and temperature data were analysed to evaluate the past variability trends (1970 to 2020) and model future (up to 2100) scenarios of climate variability and trends. Long-term observed rainfall and temperature data (1946 to 2020) were analysed to identify possible anomalies. The Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) model has been used to predict the situation of future paddy farming (2050 and 2070) under two climate scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Six variables that would affect paddy growth and yield quality were used alongside the average monthly rainfall and temperature of two Global Climate Models (MIROC5 and MPI-ESM-LR). Climate suitability for two paddy cultivation seasons (Yala and Maha) were predicted for current and future climate scenarios. The findings revealed that observed and projected climate changes show considerable deviation of expected rainfall and temperature trends across the VTCS zone. Temperature exhibits warming of approximately 1.0 \& DEG;C during the declared Global Warming Period (1970 to 2020) in the study area. In addition, there is a trend of significant warming by 0.02 \& DEG;C/year, RCP4.5 and 0.03 \& DEG;C/year, RCP8.5 from 1950 to 2100. Rainfall (1970-2020) shows high interannual variability but trends were not significant and less discernible. However, long-term projected rainfall data (1950-2100) analysis detected a significant (p = 0) upward trend (2.0 mm/year, RCP4.5 and 2.9 mm/year, RCP8.5), which is expected to continue up to the end of this century. Further, the study revealed some shifts in temperature towards higher values and positive anomalies in rainfall affecting seasonality and the likelihood of more extreme occurrences in the future, especially during the Maha cultivation season. The MaxEnt model predicts the following under future climate scenarios: (i) spatio-temporal shifts (conversions) in climate suitability for paddy farming in the VTCS zone; (ii) substantial low and moderate suitability areas that are currently suitable will remain unchanged; (iii) up to 96\% of highly suitable and 38\% of moderately suitable paddy growing areas in the VTCS zone will be at risk due to a decline in future climate suitability; and (iv) expansion of lower suitability areas by approximately 22\% to 37\%, due to conversion from moderate suitability areas. The study provides evidence that the continuous warming trend with increasing variability in rainfall and shifting seasonality could increase the vulnerability of future paddy farming in the VTCS. Thus, findings of this study will help planners to make more targeted solutions to improve adaptive capacity and regain the resilience to adjust the paddy farming pattern to deal with predicted climate variability and change.},
