Title = {Coupling coordination degree between social-economic development and
   water environment: A case study of Taihu lake basin, China},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {148},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Exploring the coupled and coordinated development of social-ecological
   systems is an important basis for promoting integrated watershed
   management. Based on the framework of the social-ecological system of
   lake water environment governance, this study builds an evaluation index
   system for quantifying the coupling and coordination of the
   social-ecological system, selects the representative key variables in
   each component of the socialecological system, and evaluates the
   coupling and coordination changes in the social-ecological system of
   Taihu lake water environment governance from 1987 to 2020. This study
   uses the coupling coordination degree model (CCDM) and the obstacle
   degree model (ODM) to reveal the dynamic relationship between the
   coupling degree (CD), the coupling coordination degree (CCD), and their
   obstacle factors of the social-ecological system of lake water
   environment governance. The results show that: (1) The comprehensive
   social system development level shows an uptrend, while ecological
   subsystem shows a decreasing and then increasing trend. With the
   development of social economy, water environment has experienced the
   process of deterioration followed by recovery. (2) CD and CCD both show
   a downward trend first and then an upward trend. CD ranges from 0.71 to
   0.98, its status had fluctuated between high-quality coupling stage and
   break-in stage. CCD ranges from 0.42 to 0.58, its status had fluctuated
   between near maladjustment recession and critical coordination stage.
   (3) The average obstacle degrees of the ecosystem and the social system
   are 0.51 and 0.49, the strong human activity interference in the social
   system and the vulnerability of the ecosystem and uncertainty jointly
   affects the CCD. Therefore, to improve the CCD of the social-ecological
   system of lake water environment governance, it is recommended that
   attention should be paid to the use and treatment of water resources in
   the process of social and economic development of the basin, and the
   amount of external pollution into the lake should be controlled in many
   ways. This study can help to understand the coupled social-ecological
   system interactions of Taihu lake water environment governance and
   provide a scientific basis for decision-makers.},

Title = {Regional social-ecological system coupling process from a water flow
   perspective},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {853},
Month = {DEC 20},
Abstract = {The social-ecological system is receiving more and more attention, and
   water resources have been a focal point for linking social systems and
   ecosystems, but how to clarify the regional social-ecological system
   coupling process through the water flow perspective and how to make
   ecosystem services management decisions still needs further re-search.
   This study integrates water quantity and quality and proposes a
   water-related ecosystem services flow frame-work. This study applied the
   framework to the Wuding River watershed and simulated water quantity and
   quality by SWAT model. The results showed that: (1) there is significant
   spatial heterogeneity in ecosystem service provisioning and meaningful
   improvement in water quality under the function of human-made capital in
   the green phase of the eco-system services flow; (2) in the red phase,
   beneficiaries use the water supply for their production and life and
   discharge >7400 tons pollution loads into the ecosystem; (3) in this
   process, human-made capital reduces about 35 \% of the am-monia
   pollution, and meanwhile, the ecosystem relies on its environment to
   further clean up about 44 \% of the load. The research framework is
   suitable for watershed social-ecological systems with simplistic
   interactions, guiding eco-logical compensation schemes and related
   management policies. Furthermore, providing a scientific basis for the
   sus-tainable use of regional water resources.},

Title = {Adoption and shift of water-saving strategies to policy shock: based on
   social-ecological system analysis},
Journal = {WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {37},

Abstract = {Water scarcity is a global issue due to climate change and increasing
   water demand. Water pricing policy is a critical instrument to stimulate
   farmers' water-saving actions. Different types of water-saving behaviors
   are closely related and interactional. It is thus necessary to study
   multiple water-saving behaviors together and their dynamic
   transformation with intensification of policy shock. Besides, whether
   the policy could work well depends much on the social-ecological system
   where farmers are embedded. This paper studies how social-ecological
   system impacts farmers' choice from multiple water-saving strategies and
   their shift of response strategies with further increase in water price.
   A field survey was conducted in semi-arid area of northwestern China
   that has suffered from severe water shortage and human-land conflicts
   for a long time. The results show that adoption of active-negative
   strategy rather than passive water-saving strategy is affected by
   productivity and predictability of resource system, number of users,
   norms, social capital, and collective choice rules. Adoption of
   active-positive strategy depends much on relative size and productivity
   of resource system, predictability of system dynamics, mobility of
   resource units, number of users, norms, social capital, and monitoring
   and sanctioning process. However, their effects have disparities, or are
   even opposite under different intensities of policy shock. When policy
   shock intensifies, mobility of resource units, number of users, resource
   importance, and monitoring and sanctioning process are identified as key
   factors to degrade farmers' water-saving strategy rather than maintain
   their original strategy. Both the size of resource system and the
   quality of social network promote farmers to upgrade response strategy.
   The results indicate that there is a complicated relationship between
   policy shock and water-saving responses in the framework of
   social-ecological system, explained by a series of mechanisms. The
   findings provide valuable implications for optimizing water pricing
   mechanism, designing targeted measures, and developing effective
   governance environment.},

Abstract = {Big river basins are complex systems of people and nature. This article
   explores the resilience of nine case studies of big river basins. A
   system description and generic conceptual model suggests that resilience
   to changes in water quantity is critical. When water becomes limiting,
   the social-ecological system must adapt rapidly if key elements (for
   example, communities, biodiversity) are to be maintained. Water
   limitation imposes a water economy and alters political and
   institutional links between actors. Pro-active management for resilience
   demands politically acceptable participatory processes that use the best
   possible science and incorporate social, ecological and economic
   elements in problem definition and solution.},

Title = {Quantifying the effects of institutional shifts on water governance in
   the Yellow River Basin: A social-ecological system perspective},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {629},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Water governance in river basins worldwide faces challenges due to
   complex socio-economic and environmental factors. In the Yellow River
   Basin (YRB), two major institutional shifts, the 1987 Water Allocation
   Scheme (87-WAS) and the 1998 Unified Basin Regulation (98-UBR), aimed to
   address water allocation and usage issues. This study quantifies the net
   effects of these institutional shifts on water use within the YRB and
   analyzes the underlying reasons for their success or failure. We employ
   a Differenced Synthetic Control method to assess the impacts of the
   institutional shifts. Our analysis suggests that the 87-WAS unexpectedly
   increased water use by 5.75\%, while the 98-UBR successfully reduced
   water use as anticipated. Our research highlights the role of
   institutional structures in governance policies, demonstrating that the
   mismatched structure of the 87-WAS led to increased competition and
   exploitation of water resources, while the 98-UBR, basin-wide authority
   and stronger connections between stakeholders, resulted in improved
   water governance. Our study underscores the importance of designing
   institutions that are consistent with the scale of the ecological
   system, promote cooperation among stakeholders, and adapt to changing
   social-ecological system (SES) contexts. As outdated and inflexible
   water quotas may no longer meet the demands of sustainable development
   in the YRB, policymakers must consider the potential consequences of
   institutional shifts and their impact on water use and sustainability.},

Abstract = {The study addresses health-associated risks and health indicators
   required for the framing of Social-Ecological System Health (SESH) in
   aquaculture food-producing systems. The advantages of using a healthy
   Social-Ecological System (SES) are highlighted, to aid in the
   development of a new ecological system fostering the sustainability of
   aquatic ecosystems. The study used statistic modelling of some human
   infections with Cryptosporidium spp. and Cyclospora spp., used to obtain
   an estimate of the costs of zoonoses to health systems, and the outcomes
   of an epidemiological study involving the Eustrongylides spp. in fish.
   The study indicated that parasitic zoonoses have an important economic
   impact on health systems, environment and society at large. Holistic
   approaches to health, addressing all relevant actors are required to
   mitigate these impacts. To address the risk of eustrongylides and other
   fish-, and water-borne zoonoses, the development of new
   social-ecological system health should be constructed. For aquaculture
   production, such systems must include a biosecurity plan co-developed
   and negotiated by all relevant stakeholders. While the system's
   feasibility is yet to be validated, regular revision of such systems'
   functioning and outputs is an important premise to make them
   operational.},

Abstract = {The object of this article is the drinking water infrastructure (DWI), a
   critical societal infrastructure. To make effective decisions it is
   important to characterise and understand the complexity of DWI systems.
   DWI systems can be seen as a system of systems, consisting of the
   social-ecological system and the social-technical system. The
   social-ecological system determines the location and seize of the water
   resources, while the social-technical system is about the technical
   infrastructure. The two systems with different characteristics must
   align to work effective together in the DWI system. The tension between
   different lifecycles of the assets and dynamic changes in both systems,
   the time of change, is important to take into account. The SoPhyTech
   infra framework was developed based on the two systems and time of
   change. The advantages of applying the SoPhyTech infra framework is
   studied in a case comparing two very different DWI systems: Indonesia
   (Semarang) and the Netherlands (Vitens). The SoPhyTech infra framework
   was shown to be effective for characterising a DWI system with different
   interacting lifecycles in different systems and it is expected that it
   also can be used to characterise other infrastructure systems.},

Abstract = {The resilience perspective, which emphasizes the integrated, systemic
   concept of human and nature interactions, is increasingly used as an
   approach for understanding the dynamic of social-ecological system. As
   the water resources system (WRS) is a social-ecological system,
   resilience thinking such as Holling's adaptive cycle has been adopted as
   a fundamental unit for understanding the water resources system dynamics
   in this paper. In the adaptive cycle of WRS, the likelihood shift among
   different phases largely depends on resilience value; and a quantitative
   method for estimating the resilience of WRS is proposed. The method is
   related to the degree of change and characteristics of the WRS, and has
   been applied to identify the phase of WRS in every city in Zhejiang
   province, China. The results of resilience assessment have also been
   discussed in terms of adaptive cycle.},

Abstract = {Groundwater resources are essential for the supply of drinking water in
   the European Union but significant uncertainties surround their quality.
   In this context, our article analyzes the factors that influence the
   cooperation of key stakeholders to prevent the risk of diffuse pollution
   from agriculture. We built on the institutional rational choice approach
   and the social-ecological system framework to design our analytical
   framework and hypotheses. We applied this analytical framework to two
   cases of cooperation involving drinking water suppliers and farmers in
   the management of the risk of non-point source pollution from
   agriculture in France. Our results show that cooperation emerges when
   the water resource is important for water suppliers to take on the
   leadership. Our results also characterize the role played by
   uncertainties and risk in getting stakeholders involved, and finally,
   suggest that cooperation depends on the size and predictability of the
   resource system.},

Number = {2},
Abstract = {Agricultural watersheds are affected by changes in climate, land use,
   agricultural practices, and human demand for energy, food, and water
   resources. In this context, we analyzed the agricultural, urbanizing
   Yahara watershed ( size: 1345 km(2), population: 372,000) to assess its
   responses to multiple changing drivers. We measured recent trends in
   land use/cover and water quality of the watershed, spatial patterns of
   10 ecosystem services, and spatial patterns and nestedness of
   governance. We developed scenarios for the future of the Yahara
   watershed by integrating trends and events from the global scenarios
   literature, perspectives of stakeholders, and models of biophysical
   drivers and ecosystem services. Four qualitative scenarios were created
   to explore plausible trajectories to the year 2070 in the watershed's
   social-ecological system under different regimes: no action on
   environmental trends, accelerated technological development, strong
   intervention by government, and shifting values toward sustainability.
   Quantitative time-series for 2010-2070 were developed for weather and
   land use/cover during each scenario as inputs to model changes in
   ecosystem services. Ultimately, our goal is to understand how changes in
   the social-ecological system of the Yahara watershed, including
   management of land and water resources, can build or impair resilience
   to shifting drivers, including climate.},

Title = {A structured participatory method to support policy option analysis in a
   social-ecological system},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {197},
Pages = {360-372},
Month = {JUL 15},
Abstract = {In this study we demonstrate how to support policy option analysis for a
   problematic Social-Ecological System (SES) with the help of stakeholder
   participation. SES sustainability problems 1) are highly complex, 2) may
   lack reliable data, 3) encompass conflicting interests and 4) may
   require contradictory management interventions. Our approach uses a
   structured participatory method combining the
   Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) model together with Fuzzy
   Cognitive Mapping (FCM) to capture the complexity of the system and
   simplify its representation for simulation and policy option analysis.
   Using this novel mixed-method was useful in dealing with above-mentioned
   characteristics of the complex SES problems. The method was applied in a
   case study of water scarcity in Rafsanjan, Iran. FCMs were produced for
   60 individual farmers and 40 individual researchers and policy makers.
   Our mixed-method analysis reveals similarities and differences of
   stakeholder knowledge and problem perception, and simulates the impacts
   of alternative policy options according to each group's perception. The
   final result of our case study indicates that farmers in Rafsanjan
   strongly believe in the impact of economic diversification on reducing
   water shortage, but they have a low level of trust in the ability of the
   government to regulate and control water usage, whereas the policy
   makers and researchers still believe in the role of government control
   and monitoring policies to deal with water scarcity in Rafsanjan. (C)

Title = {The Land-Water-Food Nexus: Expanding the Social-Ecological System
   Framework to Link Land and Water Governance},
Journal = {RESOURCES-BASEL},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {6},
Number = {3},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {To date, the land-water-food nexus has been primarily addressed from an
   ecological, hydrological or agronomic angle, with limited response to
   the governance interface between the input resources. Likewise, in
   widely used heuristic frameworks, such as the social-ecological system
   (SES) framework, governance interactions between resources are not
   sufficiently addressed. We address this gap empirically, using the case
   of Tajikistan, based on a farm household survey analysis of 306 farmers.
   The results indicate that land system variables contribute to the
   willingness to cooperate in irrigation management. Specifically, formal
   land tenure has a positive effect on farmers paying for water as well as
   on the likelihood of their investing time and effort in irrigation
   infrastructure, which is decisive for Tajikistan's food and fiber
   production. Irrigation system variables show that, e.g., being an
   upstream user increases the likelihood to contribute to labor
   maintenance efforts. We further discuss how decisions with respect to
   the land sector could be designed in the future to facilitate
   cooperation in other resource sectors. Further, we conclude from a
   conceptual perspective that the SES framework integrating a nexus
   perspective can be adapted: either (1) by adding a second-tier
   governance nexus variable inside the governance variable of an
   irrigation system; or (2) by adding a land resource unit and system
   outside the irrigation system.},

Title = {Defining and evaluating the social value of regional water resources in
   terms of emergy},
Journal = {WATER POLICY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {21},
Number = {1},
Pages = {73-90},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The social value of water resources must be considered when reforming
   water prices, improving water policy, protecting water resources and
   devising allocation methods. However, current social value theories for
   water resources are often unsound. The social value of water resources
   is defined here based on social system theory. Energy flow within a
   combined social-ecological system is analyzed, and an emergy analysis
   method for ecological economics is introduced for unified quantification
   and to improve the accounting method of the social value of water
   resources. Taking Zhengzhou in east-central China as an example, the
   social value of water resources is calculated for 2015. The water
   resources' total social emergy was 6.04 x 10(21) solar equivalent joules
   (sej) and the unit value was 6.58 x 10(12) sej/m(3). This corresponds to
   3.88\$/m(3), indicating that the social value of water resources is
   enormous. This paper proposes that the social value of water is an
   important component of its ecological economic value, and its social
   value should therefore be considered by water policy makers. Research of
   this type can be effective in helping to protect water resources and
   encourage efficient water use.},

Title = {Village leadership, social networks and collective actions in indigenous
   communities: Case of Hani rice terrace social-ecological system in
   Southwest China},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {106},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Leadership and social networks substantially influence the collective
   actions in rural communities. It is important to understand how village
   elites influence villagers through social networks and facilitate
   collective actions, especially for indigenous communities. This paper
   takes the rice terrace social-ecological system (SES) of the Hani ethnic
   minority in China as a case and adopts a mixed methodology to explore
   the diversified roles of various types of village elites in the
   collective actions of managing four social-ecological sub-systems:
   forests, villages, terraces, and water. Results reveal that
   institutional and non-institutional elites play different roles in
   coordinating the collective actions of managing four sub-systems. Social
   network analysis shows that village elites have high degree centrality
   and play bridging roles between different sub-groups, but differences
   exist between the network patterns of managing forests and water and
   managing villages and terraces. Contagion models show that both
   friendship and advice networks contribute to the social influence among
   villagers, but advice networks have larger influences in managing
   villages, terraces, and water than friendship networks. This study
   provides insights into the heterogeneity and dynamics of village
   leadership and social networks in managing rural SESs that are
   experiencing rapid socio-economic changes, and the results contribute to
   making integrative and adaptive planning and development policies for
   indigenous communities.},

Title = {Water service delivery challenges in a small South African municipality:
   Identifying and exploring key elements and relationships in a complex
   social-ecological system},
Journal = {WATER SA},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {43},

Abstract = {South Africa is a developing country undergoing social and ecological
   transformation. Water service delivery (i) exemplifies the challenge of
   improvement and transformation towards a more socially and ecologically
   just situation, and (ii) can usefully be viewed as a complex
   social-ecological system (C-SES) in the search for `just transitions'.
   Household water security problems associated with water service delivery
   in South Africa are recognisably intractable, multi-scaled, comprising
   many actors and elements and having no single solution. There is a
   global and South African trend towards systemic approaches to addressing
   such complex water challenges. However, the steps required to take a
   systemic approach are seldom explicit. This paper presents the
   analytical process of defining boundaries, identifying elements and
   exploring relationships between elements as the foundational step in a
   study of the Makana Local Municipality water service delivery C-SES in
   the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa. The resulting narrative and
   heuristics provide a clear systemic basis from which to research the
   emergence, practice and social learning process of a civil society
   organisation (Water for Dignity) seeking to confront water service
   delivery issues in the Makana Local Municipality.},

Title = {Collective action for water quality management in agriculture: The case
   of drinking water source protection in France},
Journal = {GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {58},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Nonpoint source pollution from agriculture represents a major threat to
   the quality of water in the European Union (EU) context. As part of the
   implementation process of the EU Water Framework Directive in France,
   the cooperation between water suppliers and agricultural stakeholders
   has been recently promoted for limiting diffuse agricultural pollution
   at the water catchment level. Based on a conceptual framework combining
   transaction cost economics and the social-ecological system (SES)
   framework, this paper identifies the conditions under which such
   collective action is effective for the restoration/maintenance of water
   quality. The research relies on a cross-case comparison of cooperation
   in six drinking water catchments. A qualitative analysis of primary data
   collected at the national, water basin and local levels serves as a
   basis for the multi-case investigation. Variables related to the
   hydrogeological system, the stakeholders involved, the contracts
   governing cooperation and the economic and policy contexts are shown to
   interact in their influence on collective action. The results highlight
   the importance of the match between contract incentives and the
   characteristics of the local context and the potential complementarities
   between informational, regulatory and economic policy tools for
   enhancing the effectiveness of collective action for water pollution
   control.},

Title = {Changes in institutional and social-ecological system robustness due to
   the adoption of large-scale irrigation technology in Navarre (Spain)},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {30},
Number = {4},
Pages = {167-181},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Many regional and national organisations promote the modernisation of
   agriculture by supporting new technologies to increase their territory's
   competitiveness in a free-market context. Such technologies and their
   associated intensive land management practices are geared towards
   obtaining higher yields. However, their application also entails changes
   in water and land management institutions, which could alter
   interactions among multiple components of the agrarian social-ecological
   system and potentially weaken the system. Here, we assess how these
   components and their relations change in a village situated in Navarre
   (Spain) after the uptake of large-scale irrigation infrastructure.
   Specifically, we analyse such changes by comparing how the design
   principles for robust social-ecological systems manifest before and
   after the adoption of large-scale irrigation. Our findings indicate that
   an unequal distribution of water and land induces some farmers to
   abandon their agrarian activities. Our case study also shows how
   irrigation communities have partially lost their autonomy to
   self-organise and make agrarian management-related decisions. We suggest
   that the adoption of large-scale irrigation in this region contributes
   to a decrease in cooperation among resource users, and between users and
   infrastructure providers. This is due to a decline in the capacity to
   achieve collective-choice arrangements and higher external control and
   monitoring of water use. We argue that the current agrarian management
   changes may damage social-ecological system robustness and affect the
   sustainable use of common-pool resources, leading farmers to
   maladaptation to climate and market variability.},

Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {18},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT 10},
Abstract = {Understanding public perceptions, values, and preferences can be
   fundamental to effective conservation governance, management, and
   outreach. This is particularly true in socially and ecologically complex
   marine and coastal spaces, where many relevant questions remain. The
   social-ecological system of Biscayne Bay and Miami-Dade are on the
   frontier of problems that will soon engulf many coastal-urban systems.
   Despite the economic, ecological, and cultural importance of Biscayne
   Bay, research into the social components of this social-ecological
   system is distinctly lacking. In order to effectively address urgent
   coastal management issues, practitioners and policy-makers need a clear
   understanding of public perceptions, values, and priorities. In this
   paper I present the results of a large online survey (n = 1146)
   exploring public attitudes toward Biscayne Bay as a case study of
   management and opportunity in a complex coastal social-ecological
   system. Results describe a public that interacts with and utilizes
   Biscayne Bay in a variety of ways, from leisure and recreation, to
   subsistence. This public believes the Bay to be moderately healthy,
   though somewhat in decline, and has experienced a range of local
   environmental threats, about which they feel considerable concern. These
   interactions and concerns are in turn reflected in overwhelming
   endorsement of value statements regarding the ecological, material,
   cultural and economic importance of the ecosystem to the city, as well
   as high levels of support for policy actions to protect and restore that
   ecosystem. Together these findings indicate that additional policy steps
   to preserve and restore Biscayne Bay would enjoy support from the local
   public and demonstrate the power of public perceptions research to
   identify gaps and opportunities for management and outreach.},

Abstract = {Wetlands are unique ecosystems formed by the interaction between land
   and water on Earth. Poyang Lake, which is a part of China's largest
   freshwater lake wetland, is well known for its ecological and economic
   importance. This study uses a social-ecological system (SES) framework
   that integrates watershed and human activities; we used action scenarios
   to analyse the influencing factors, solutions, and feedback mechanisms
   involved in the SES framework. We chose Nanchang, Jiujiang, and Shangrao
   in the Poyang Lake wetlands of the Jiangxi province as the study areas
   to provide a problem-oriented analytical strategy for the organic
   interface between ecological conservation and green development. The key
   issues indicate that the Poyang Lake region faces multiple problems,
   such as ecosystem structural changes and environmental pollution, caused
   by anthropological activities, inefficient implementation of
   conservation policies, and insufficient funding for pollution prevention
   and control. Our findings provide a systematic solution for major
   conservation and development issues in the Poyang Lake region and are
   adapted to the characteristics of the lake. We also provide a
   theoretical reference and direction for the implementation of green
   development and modernisation of ecological governance in the Great
   Lakes basin in China.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we frame the problem of urban water sustainability in
   megacities as a social-ecological system (SES) to examine the underlying
   coupling of social and ecological factors and processes. Based on our
   empirical research of two major megacities of the global south, SAo
   Paulo and Delhi, we have developed an urban water SES module within the
   broader SES framework proposed by Ostrom. The module's multilevel nested
   structure consists of the following four subsystems: water resource and
   infrastructure, settlements, governance, and actors. A distinct
   advantage of our module is that it enables us to capture the plurality
   of settlements patterns (from formal to informal settlements), actor
   networks, and governance patterns found in cities of the global south
   and how these uniquely shape and are shaped by the process of rapid
   urbanization. We use this module as: (a) an analytical tool to identify
   the different variables and processes within each subsystem, which
   through their interactions, have influenced the trajectory of water
   systems in these cities; (b) a diagnostic tool in a comparative setting
   to examine why desired goals in terms of service delivery and/or
   governance were achieved (or not); and (c) a prescriptive tool to
   identify cross-learnings and practical lessons.},

Title = {Modeling the resilient supply of ecosystem function for climate change
   adaptive management in Wetland City},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {322},
Month = {NOV 15},
Abstract = {Rapid urbanization causes wetland ecosystem functions to degrade
   worldwide. This phenomenon negatively affects the resilience of
   ecosystem functions in the face of unexpected impacts, particularly
   climate change. An approach is required for combining resilience with
   management in a Wetland City. This study aims to model the resilience of
   ecosystem functions for climate change adaptation management in a
   Wetland City via system dy-namics from 2021 to 2100. First, we set a
   system boundary through expert interviews to identify the main issues in
   the social-ecological system of a Wetland City. Second, we constructed a
   social-ecological system of a Wetland City that provides ecosystem
   function trade-offs between flood control and wildlife habitat
   provisioning. Then, we simulated the resilience of ecosystem functions
   according to different climate change adaptative management scenarios.
   Finally, we determined an appropriate scenario for minimizing the
   impacts of ecosystem function trade-offs reinforced by climate change.
   As a result, we recommend that the water level should be managed such
   that the controlled flood water level ranges from 12 to 14 m and that
   30\% of the willow areas should be thinned each year. Based on these
   simulation results, we proposed three climate change adaptive management
   strategies: considering long-term plans including short-term effects,
   networking with multiscale community participation, and applying
   sustainable wetland management to urban planning. Ultimately, this study
   can contribute to planning and management guidelines for a Wetland City.},

Abstract = {Coral reefs are threatened globally by the climatic consequences of
   rising atmospheric CO2 levels; in many regions they are also threatened
   locally, for example, by reductions in the water quality of runoff from
   adjacent catchments. Interaction between global and local pressures
   makes it possible to use local actions to mitigate the impacts of
   climate change. To this end, managers and policy-makers are seeking to
   implement agricultural land management regimes that improve runoff water
   quality and thereby reduce risks to the Great Barrier Reef. Although
   components of the Great Barrier Reef Region have been researched for
   some time, a systemic approach capable of representing the Region's key
   functional relationships as a social-ecological system is lacking. Here
   we provide a conceptual framework of the Great Barrier Reef
   social-ecological system that identifies a range of complex
   socioeconomic tradeoffs that may be required to maintain resilient reefs
   under climate change. The conceptual framework is the first step toward
   development of a functional analytical tool that is capable of helping
   policy-makers choose between alternative management actions.},

Abstract = {The wetlands of the Amudarya River delta in Uzbekistan provide valuable
   ecosystem services to the local human population which has suffered
   severely from the loss of the Aral Sea, desertification and the
   post-soviet socio-economic transition. The region is also particularly
   vulnerable to the impacts of climate change as a recent severe drought
   has shown. In this contribution, we assess the potential and
   implications of incorporating environmental flows into management of the
   Amudarya River for improving the provision of wetland ecosystem services
   and enhancing resilience of the social-ecological system to river runoff
   uncertainty. Our assessment is based on analyses of 1) the current
   vulnerability of deltaic wetlands to years of low water availability, 2)
   expected regional climate change and its impact on water flows to the
   wetlands, and 3) alternative water use options to enhance environmental
   flows under a changing climate. The results provide a ranking of these
   options with respect to their benefits for the provision of
   environmental flows and implications for agriculture. Their realization,
   however, poses challenges that cannot be tackled by technical
   interventions of redistribution and efficiency increase alone but call
   for institutional changes and moves towards multi-purpose water use. The
   diversification of impacts and livelihood options would allow enhancing
   the resilience of the social-ecological system to climate or
   socio-politically induced changes in water flow. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {Ecosystem Services Linking Social and Ecological Systems: River
   Brownification and the Response of Downstream Stakeholders},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {16},
Number = {4},
Abstract = {The theoretical framework of ecosystem services and that of resilience
   thinking are combined in an empirical case study of a social-ecological
   system. In the River Helge a catchment in southern Sweden, a slow
   increase in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) results in brownification of
   the water with consequences on ecosystem services in the lower part of
   the catchment of concern by local resource managers. An assessment of
   ecosystem service delivery was conducted to (1) identify plausible
   drivers of brownification in the study site and assess future ecosystem
   service delivery for stakeholders in downstream areas. An analysis of
   the perspective of beneficiaries, using qualitative methods, was pursued
   to (2) evaluate the impacts of brownification on downstream
   stakeholders.
   Our analyses of drivers of brownification in combination with climate
   change projections suggests that Kristianstads Vattenrike Biosphere
   Reserve will experience extreme water flows much more frequently than
   the system is accustomed to today, and that these water flows will be
   highly affected by brownification. The combination of severe summer
   flooding and high water color constituted a new disturbance regime and
   thus requires new adaptive strategies by local stakeholders. A range of
   coping and adaptation strategies were displayed by the farmers but also
   a possible transformation strategy, i.e., abandonment of the seasonally
   flooded meadows. Because hay making and grazing are central components
   in the active management of the Kristianstads Vattenrike Biosphere
   Reserve, to discontinue this practice would have system-wide
   ramifications for the Biosphere Reserve. The vulnerability of fishing in
   the culturally significant ``Eel Coast,{''} part of the downstream area,
   was also exposed.
   We argue that for environmental monitoring of slow changing variables to
   make sense to local stakeholders, clear links to ecosystem service
   benefits are required. The responsibility for this and thus for matching
   of social and ecological scales falls heavily on regional managers. We
   further argue that resilience of a social-ecological system can be
   estimated by observing and analyzing how local stakeholders respond to
   disturbances, i.e., by analyzing their response strategies.},

Abstract = {Effective management of recreational fishing requires understanding
   fishers and their actions. These actions constitute critical links
   between social and ecological systems that result in outcomes that
   feedback and influence recreational fishers' actions and the management
   of these actions. Although much research exists on recreational fishers
   and their actions, this research is often disconnected from management
   issues. One way to help to overcome this disconnect is to illustrate how
   past research on the social component of recreational fishing fits
   within an emerging coupled social-ecological system (SES) framework.
   Herein, a conceptual SES is first developed with specific attention to
   recreational fisheries. This SES is then used to illustrate the
   importance of considering human dimensions research for articulating,
   studying and ultimately managing key outcomes of recreational fisheries
   (e.g. fish population conservation, fisher well-being) using the example
   of harvest regulations and a brief review of past interdisciplinary
   research on recreational fishing. The article ends by identifying key
   research needs including understanding: how factors such as management
   rules affect the diversity of actions by recreational fishers; how
   governance and management approaches adapt to changing social and
   resource conditions; and how recreational fishers learn and share
   information.},

Abstract = {Current governance of regional scale water management systems in the
   United States has not placed them on a path toward sustainability, as
   conflict and gridlock characterize the social arena and ecosystem
   services continue to erode. Changing climate may continue this
   trajectory, but it also provides a catalyst for renewal of ecosystems
   and a window of opportunity for change in institutions. Resilience
   provides a bridging concept that predicts that change in ecological and
   social systems is often dramatic, abrupt, and surprising. Adapting to
   the uncertainty of climate driven change must be done in a manner
   perceived as legitimate by the participants in a democratic society.
   Adaptation must begin with the current hierarchical and fragmented
   social-ecological system as a baseline from which new approaches must be
   applied. Achieving a level of integration between ecological concepts
   and governance requires a dialogue across multiple disciplines,
   including ecologists with expertise in ecological resilience,
   hydrologists and climate experts, with social scientists and legal
   scholars. Criteria and models that link ecological dynamics with
   policies in complex, multi-jurisdictional water basins with adaptive
   management and governance frameworks may move these social-ecological
   systems toward greater sustainability.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {112},
Pages = {348-360},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Debate continues regarding which policy instrument should be used to
   ensure land, water, and environmental governance that promotes the
   sustainability of social-ecological systems (SESs). Policy instruments
   and Social Ecological Systems have played important roles in the
   theoretical development of natural resource governance systems. They,
   however, have been considered in isolation from one another. This study
   aims to bridge between the two by interpreting policy instruments as
   rules of interaction in a social-ecological system. Specifically, a
   longitudinal study on Victorian Acts was conducted to understand how
   policy instruments for land, water, and environmental governances
   adopted from 1860 to 2016 worked in the governance of SESs. Through a
   content analysis of the Acts, we constructed a simple typology of the
   ways in which policy instruments manage components of SESs. This
   typology includes the reserve regime, authority regime, information
   regime and integration regime. The study shows the circumstances under
   which interactions among components of biophysical and social systems
   deserve attention as partial shapers of policy instruments. The present
   work can be used to understand, examine and reflect on policy
   instruments currently used for resource governance and to make strategic
   improvements that account for current conditions rather than adopting
   new policies without understanding the existing context.},

Title = {Mechanisms of resilience in common-pool resource management systems:: an
   agent-based model of water use in a river basin},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {12},
Number = {2},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The concept of resilience is widely promoted as a promising notion to
   guide new approaches to ecosystem and resource management that try to
   enhance a system's capacity to cope with change. A variety of mechanisms
   of resilience specific for different systems have been proposed. In the
   context of resource management those include but are not limited to the
   diversity of response options and flexibility of the social system to
   adaptively respond to changes on an adequate scale. However,
   implementation of resilience-based management in specific real-world
   systems has often proven difficult because of a limited understanding of
   suitable interventions and their impact on the resilience of the coupled
   social-ecological system. We propose an agent-based modeling approach to
   explore system characteristics and mechanisms of resilience in a complex
   resource management system, based on a case study of water use in the
   Amudarya River, which is a semiarid river basin. Water resources in its
   delta are used to sustain irrigated agriculture as well as aquatic
   ecosystems that provide fish and other ecosystem services. The three
   subsystems of the social-ecological system, i.e., the social system, the
   irrigation system, and an aquatic ecosystem, are linked by resource
   flows and the allocation decision making of actors on different levels.
   Simulation experiments are carried out to compare the resilience of
   different institutional settings of water management to changes in the
   variability and uncertainty of water availability. The aim is to
   investigate the influence of ( 1) the organizational structure of water
   management, ( 2) information on water availability, and ( 3) the
   diversity of water uses on the resilience of the system to short and
   long-term water scarcity. In this paper, the model concept and first
   simulation results are presented. As a first illustration of the
   approach the performances of a centralized and a decentralized regime
   are compared under different scenarios of information on water
   availability. Under the given conditions of a regularly fluctuating
   inflow and compliance of agents with orders from a national authority,
   the centralized system performs better as long as irrigation is the only
   type of water use. Diversification of resource use, e. g., irrigation
   and fishing, increases the performance of the decentralized regime and
   the resilience of both. Systematic analysis of the performance of
   different system structures will help to identify properties and
   mechanisms of resilience. This understanding will be valuable for the
   identification, development, and evaluation of management interventions
   in specific river basins.},

Abstract = {Elinor Ostrom and colleagues developed the social-ecological system
   framework with the aim of synthesizing knowledge to foster a better
   understanding of the relationship between people, institutions and the

   complex systems; it has thus far struggled to account for the role of
   history in structuring the range of opportunities and constraints that
   actors face as they interact with the environment and each other. More
   recent innovations in measuring institutions and the integration of
   process-oriented approaches are beginning to provide the tools required
   to systematically trace the co-evolution of institutions and
   social-ecological systems. We review the history and development of
   social-ecological system scholarship, including longstanding concerns
   regarding the weak inclusion of temporal dynamics. We highlight the
   contributions of three novel advances - namely the combined IAD-SES
   framework, the institutional grammar tool, and the power in polycentric

Title = {How do farmers' environmental preferences influence the efficiency of
   information instruments for water quality management? Evidence from a
   social-ecological agent-based model},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MODELLING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {478},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Diverse public policies encourage farmers to adopt eco-friendly
   practices to address the issue of diffuse pollution from agriculture,
   including measures based on the provision of information on the
   environment. Indeed, farmers' perception of the state of the water body
   and their awareness of the causes and consequences of water pollution
   affect their willingness to adopt eco-friendly farming practices. Public
   policies therefore have a role to play in disseminating environmental
   information. In this article, we investigate how information measures
   may exert influence on changes in farming practices and thereby water
   pollution. We extend an existing agent-based model of a
   social-ecological system representing a drinking water catchment area.
   In the decision-making process based on the theory of planned behaviour
   we integrate a dynamical environmental component of farmers' attitude
   towards eco-friendly practices, in order to take into account the effect
   of information on the ecological system. We explore the impact of
   information measures, heterogeneity in farmers' environmental
   preferences and var-iations in the initial level of water pollution on
   farmers' participation to a water catchment protection pro-gramme. Our
   results show that: (1) targeting farmers who have higher environmental
   preferences is more effective than no targeting; (2) the heterogeneity
   in farmers' environmental preferences impacts their involve-ment in the
   programme depending on the average environmental preferences; (3) the
   higher the initial pollution, the higher the farmers are involved in the
   protection programme; (4) when two different measures are combined, once
   a certain threshold of public awareness is reached, there is a synergy
   between them.},

Volume = {584},
Pages = {673-682},
Month = {APR 15},
Abstract = {This study makes a first attempt to operationalize the safe operating
   space concept at a regional scale by considering the complex dynamics
   (e.g. non-linearity, feedbacks, and interactions) within a systems
   dynamic model (SD). We employ the model to explore eight `what if'
   scenarios based on well-known challenges (e.g. climate change) and
   current policy debates (e.g. subsidy withdrawal). The findings show that
   the social-ecological system in the Bangladesh delta may move beyond a
   safe operating space when a withdrawal of a 50\% subsidy for agriculture
   is combined with the effects of a 2 degrees C temperature increase and
   sea level rise. Further reductions in upstream river discharge in the
   Ganges would push the system towards a dangerous zone once a 3.5 degrees
   C temperature increase was reached. The social-ecological system in
   Bangladesh delta may be operated within a safe space by: 1) managing
   feedback (e.g. by reducing production costs) and the slow biophysical
   variables (e.g. temperature, rainfall) to increase the long-term
   resilience, 2) negotiating for transboundasy water resources, and 3)
   revising global policies (e.g. withdrawal of subsidy) that negatively
   impact at regional scales. This study demonstrates how the concepts of
   tipping points, limits to adaptations, and boundaries for sustainable
   development may be defined in real world social-ecological systems. (C)

Title = {Can water systems foster commoning practices? Analysing leverages for
   self-organization in urban water commons as social-ecological systems},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {15},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {Research into urban commons has gained momentum in recent years. This
   article concentrates on the concept and analysis of urban water commons
   as social-ecological systems, which receive a less prominent focus in
   the literature than other commoning practices. In the light of the
   distinctive social and ecological values of water for both ecosystem
   health and human wellbeing and sociability, we argue that the presence
   of water systems can foster stakeholder engagement and leverage
   self-organization in urban commons. We test our hypothesis in a
   dynamically evolving urban water common: the recently restored Geoffrey
   Jellicoe's Water Gardens in Hemel Hempstead, England. We apply Ostrom's
   multilevel diagnostic tool, the ``Social-Ecological System
   framework{''}, to analyse the characteristics of the Gardens water
   system and their impact on the self-organizing process undertaken by the
   local community. Our application is supported by collection of primary
   and secondary data, including Jellicoe's design archived evidence, field
   observation data, in-depth interviews with key stakeholders, as well as
   data mining from social media (topic modelling of Facebook posts, review
   of Facebook user profiles, and Twitter mention-network analysis).
   Through our results, we identify a broad spectrum of characteristics of
   the Gardens urban water common that can catalyse the local
   self-organization dynamics. These include the leadership position of a
   specific non-governmental stakeholder group with knowledge and expertise
   on water ecosystems; active engagement of the local population across
   age groups in recreational activities on the water; community-building
   through expertise and knowledge-sharing on the peculiar natural and
   infrastructural components of the Gardens water systems; and, finally,
   continued online networking and social-media communication among
   different stakeholder groups on water-related activities.},

Title = {Save water or save wildlife? Water use and conservation in the central
   Sierran foothill oak woodlands of California, USA},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {22},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {More frequent drought is projected for California. As water supplies
   constrict, and urban growth and out-migration spread to rural areas,
   trade-offs in water use for agriculture, biodiversity conservation, fire
   hazard reduction, residential development, and quality of life will be
   exacerbated. The California Black Rail (Laterallus jamaicensis
   coturniculus), state listed as ``Threatened,{''} depends on leaks from
   antiquated irrigation district irrigation systems for much of its
   remnant small wetland habitat in the north central Sierra Nevada
   foothills. Residents of the 1295 km(2) foothill habitat distribution of
   the Black Rail were surveyed about water use. Results show that the most
   Black Rail habitat is owned by those purchasing water to irrigate
   pasture, a use that commonly creates wetlands from leaks and tailwater.
   Promoting wildlife, agricultural production, and preventing wildfire are
   common resident goals that call for abundant and inexpensive water;
   social and economic pressures encourage reduction in water use and the
   repair of leaks that benefit wildlife and greenery. Broad inflexible
   state interventions to curtail water use are likely to create a
   multitude of unintended consequences, including loss of biodiversity and
   environmental quality, and alienation of residents as valued ecosystem
   services literally dry up. Adaptive and proactive policies are needed
   that consider the linkages in the social-ecological system, are
   sensitive to local conditions, prevent landscape dewatering, and
   recognize the beneficial use of water to support ecosystem services such
   as wildlife habitat. Much Black Rail habitat is anthropogenic, created
   at the nexus of local governance, plentiful water, agricultural
   practices, historical events, and changing land uses. This history
   should be recognized and leveraged rather than ignored in a rush to
   ``save{''} water by unraveling the social-ecological system that created
   the landscape. Policy and governance needs to identify and prioritize
   habitat areas to maintain during drought.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {219},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Oases provide the most important support to human livelihood and
   economic activities in drylands. In recent decades, nature and humanity
   in oases areas have been increasingly integrated, and it is necessary to
   coordinate the development of the two. This study quantitatively defined
   the evolutionary phases of the social-ecological system based on varying
   correlations among agricultural, socioeconomic, and ecological factors.
   Three different evolutionary phases have been identified in the
   development of oases in northwestern China since 2000. In the first
   phase, the groundwater supply increased with agricultural and
   socioeconomic development. The subsequent phase was characterized as the
   groundwater supply increased with faster agricultural development. In
   the final phase, the groundwater supply decreased in response to urban
   development improvements. As social factors such as population, economic
   growth, urbanization, and environmental protection became more reliant
   on groundwater, its contribution to groundwater depletion increased from
   8.37\% to 76.52\%, which further constrained grain production. The
   findings emphasized that groundwater allocation played a critical role
   in influencing the development mode of the oasis system. Achieving
   sustainable social-ecological development requires an integrated and
   systemic perspective that focuses on the tradeoff between food
   production, ecological security, water resource security and economic
   development.},

Abstract = {The European Alps are known as the `water towers of Europe'. However,
   climatic and socioeconomic changes influence both water supply and
   demand, increasing the need to manage this limited and valuable resource
   properly to avoid user conflicts and water scarcity. Two major
   challenges emerge when assessing water scarcity in the Alps: Firstly,
   mountainous regions are very heterogeneous regarding water availability
   and demand over space and time, and therefore water scarcity assessments
   need to be done at low temporal and spatial scales. Secondly, the tight
   coupling of the natural and the social sphere necessitate an integrative
   approach considering dynamics and interactions of the social-ecological
   system. Hence, we applied the agent-based water supply and demand model
   Aqua.MORE, which is designed for catchment scale and sub-daily temporal
   resolution, to a case study site in the Italian Alps. In the model, the
   water supply, the local water managers and water users are represented
   by interacting model agents. We estimated the water supply by refining
   the annual runoff data provided by the InVEST water yield model for
   within-year variations. Local stakeholders contributed to the
   development of quantitative and spatially-explicit scenarios for land
   use and tourism evolution. To evaluate water supply and demand dynamics,
   we assessed six scenarios for the period of 2015 to 2050: three
   different socio-economic policy pathways, both alone and in combination
   with a climate change scenario. In all six scenarios, the water
   demand:supply (D:S) ratio continuously rises from 2015 to 2050. The
   highest D:S ratio values are prognosed at the beginning of the
   irrigation period in May. In all scenarios considering climatic changes,
   the D:S ratio exceeds 20\% for several days, indicating potential water
   scarcity. The simulation results reinforce the importance of analysing
   water balances at a high temporal resolution and can support management
   processes and stakeholder dialogues for sustainable watershed
   management. (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Title = {Integrated environmental assessment to explore water resources
   management in Al Jabal Al Akhdar, Sultanate of Oman},
Journal = {REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {16},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1345-1361},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Al Jabal Al Akhdar, an arid mountain region in northern Oman, has
   experienced rapid development over the last decades, resulting in the
   deterioration of water resources. This paper applies the driving
   force-pressure-state-impact-response (DPSIR) framework as an integrated
   environmental assessment tool to illustrate the cause-and-effect
   relationships for sustainable management of water resources in the area.
   The research aimed to examine social and ecological aspects of mountain
   water to explore optimal approaches for sustainable use and management.
   The water resources are affected by increasing drivers of population
   growth and socio-economic development, through agriculture, tourism, and
   urbanization, exerting pressures through overconsumption of water,
   coupled with the exogenous pressure of climate change. The decreased
   rainfall and increased water demand have resulted in the degradation of
   water quantity and quality. The declining state of the water resources
   and reduced area of cultivation have resulted in considerable losses in
   agricultural income. The Omani government has adopted some responses,
   including water development projects, acting to reduce pressures as well
   as to improve the state of water resources. The DPSIR analysis indicates
   that trade-offs should be made between economic development and the
   continued supply of water for the agro-ecological system; choices could
   be in the prioritization of drivers. A dependence on desalinated water
   will introduce a reliance on a non-renewable external energy supply and
   is unlikely to ensure water supply at the multi-century timescale of the
   social-ecological system. In addition, tourism is predominantly based
   around the disappearing agro-ecosystems which in turn are dependent on
   the supply of water. Therefore, efforts should be directed towards
   improving water-use efficiency through installing modern irrigation
   technology, water conservation methods, use of greywater and treated
   wastewater, and rainwater harvesting as well as integrated water
   resources management, and climate change mitigation and adaptation
   measures.},

Title = {Adapting the social-ecological system framework for urban stormwater
   management: the case of green infrastructure adoption},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {21},
Number = {4},
Abstract = {Stormwater management has long been a critical societal and
   environmental challenge for communities. An increasing number of
   municipalities are turning to novel approaches such as green
   infrastructure to develop more sustainable stormwater management
   systems. However, there is a need to better understand the technological
   decision-making processes that lead to specific outcomes within urban
   stormwater governance systems. We used the social-ecological system
   (SES) framework to build a classification system for identifying
   significant variables that influence urban stormwater governance
   decisions related to green infrastructure adoption. To adapt the
   framework, we relied on findings from observations at national
   stormwater meetings in combination with a systematic literature review
   on influential factors related to green infrastructure adoption. We
   discuss our revisions to the framework that helped us understand the
   decision by municipal governments to adopt green infrastructure.
   Remaining research needs and challenges are discussed regarding the
   development of an urban stormwater SES framework as a classification
   tool for knowledge accumulation and synthesis.},

Abstract = {Vulnerability is one of the prominent features of rural areas due to
   their distinctive characteristics, such as remoteness, geographical
   conditions, and socio-economic dependence on primary sectors. Addressing
   the vulnerability of rural areas in terms of the rural development
   paradigm is both urgent and relevant. This study aims to address this
   issue using the current state-of-the-art machine learning method, using
   the socio-ecological framework and integrated vulnerability index of
   villages in Lampung Province in Indonesia. The study attempts to predict
   and classify villages' vulnerability to be applied for better planning
   and rural development. Based on random forest classification and
   decision tree algorithm, the results show that the village governance
   system represented by rural water management and the level of education
   of village leaders are suitable prediction variables related to the low
   vulnerability index. This study can draw lessons learned to improve
   rural development in developing countries. (c) 2022 by the authors;

Abstract = {Research on water resource conflicts needs to be better aligned with
   practitioner approaches to water resources development, chiefly
   integrated water resources management (IWRM). This paper bridges the gap
   between research and practice through a novel application of the
   social-ecological systems framework to a set of 10 conflict cases from
   an IWRM initiative in rural Central America. The conflicts in the
   empirical cases are found to be primarily the result of socio-political
   variables, particularly low levels of trust and social capital, and
   peacebuilding is suggested as a promising approach to address this suite
   of conflicts. The paper concludes with a proposed course of research
   designed to further both theoretical and applied knowledge of water
   resource conflicts.},

Abstract = {Transboundary water resources, such as international river basins, pose
   complex and often contentious management challenges. In response to the
   failures associated with the state-centric approach to the governance of
   international waters, discussions on transboundary water resources
   governance over the last two decades or so have focused largely on
   public involvement. The need to build resilience into such governance
   systems has been virtually overlooked. Based on a conceptualization of
   transboundary water resources as complex social-ecological systems, the
   manuscript proposes adaptive governance as a unifying framework for
   informing policies aimed at promoting the conservation of transboundary
   water resources in an increasingly unpredictable future. The key
   attributes of adaptive governance satisfy the requirements for good
   governance of transboundary water resources, as well as preparing the
   coupled social-ecological system to respond to unpredictable drivers of
   change.},

Title = {Implementing Integrated Catchment Management in the upper Limpopo River
   basin: A situational assessment},
Journal = {PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {93},
Pages = {104-118},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {A three-phase study was initiated as a way to promote Integrated
   Catchment Management approaches in the Limpopo River basin. This paper
   presents the situational assessment, which should enable De Beers to
   understand how their Venetia Mine operations are located within a
   broader and highly dynamic socioeconomic and ecohydrological landscape
   as it pertains to water risks. The second phase, Risk assessment, aims
   to develop conservation interventions in the identified areas; the third
   phase will develop mechanisms for implementing water stewardship schemes
   to mitigate the shared water risks.
   Analysis of the social-ecological system (hydrological, climatic,
   ecological, socio-economic and governance systems) of the Limpopo River
   basin indicates that the institutional arrangement of the Limpopo River
   basin is neither simple nor effective. The basin is rapidly approaching
   closure in the sense that almost all of the available supplies of water
   have already been allocated to existing water users. If the proposed
   ecological flow requirements were to be met for all of the tributaries,
   the basin would be `closed'. On-going and projected land use changes and
   water resources developments in the upper reaches of the basin, coupled
   with projected rainfall reductions and temperature increases, and
   allocation of the flows for the ecological reserve, are likely to
   further reduce downstream river flows. The coupled increase in
   temperature and decrease in rainfall is of great concern for everyone in
   the basin, especially the poorer communities, who rely on rain-fed
   agriculture for their livelihoods. Increased temperatures also lead to
   increased evaporation from reservoirs and therefore result in a decrease
   in water availability. This will lead to increased abstraction of
   groundwater, especially from alluvial aquifers, and consequently an
   increase in river transmission losses and a decrease in river flows. (C)

Journal = {LAND USE POLICY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {91},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Global groundwater overexploitation positions groundwater governance as
   a critical issue for improving sustainable water management. Evidence of
   aquifer recovery after overexploitation is scattered, as is the research
   on the drivers behind recovery. The Fuencaliente Aquifer in Spain faced
   a tragedy of the commons situation, but after an innovative governance
   arrangement was implemented, the aquifer is gradually recovering. In
   this research, we identify the drivers that made possible the emergence
   and acceptance of such an arrangement using the social-ecological system
   framework. We identified external drivers such as market incentives and
   limited enforcement capacity of the water authority as the main factors
   that led to groundwater depletion, but we also found that these same
   drivers, under a new regulatory framework that reinforced monitoring and
   sanctioning capacities, are the basis for the effective recovery of the
   aquifer. Internal drivers such as the socioeconomic attributes of the
   users, their limited collective action and the power differences between
   traditional and commercial farmers are also critical in explaining the
   acceptance of the new governance arrangement. Even if these drivers are
   context-specific, we identified innovations that might be transferable
   and contribute to the literature on good practices in groundwater
   governance and management.},

Abstract = {This paper is a social-ecological systems (SES) analysis of tourism and
   water inequity in Bali. It uses Elinor Ostrom's SES model to look at the
   particular niche of Bali's tourism and water nexus. Re-analysis of
   previous qualitative research revealed that the vulnerability of the SES
   was due to numerous characteristics. In particular, user groups are
   highly diverse, transient and stratified, thereby inhibiting
   communication and knowledge sharing. This, in combination with weak
   governance systems and the economic power of the tourism industry,
   interact to affect declining water resources and the iniquitous impact
   of this. Whilst there are obvious indications that Bali's water
   resources are over stretched, there is no feedback loop to the
   institutional structures that would help enable appropriate responses
   from the user groups or governance system.},

Title = {Connecting Social Networks with Ecosystem Services for Watershed
   Governance: a Social-Ecological Network Perspective Highlights the
   Critical Role of Bridging Organizations},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {17},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {In many densely settled agricultural watersheds, water quality is a
   point of conflict between amenity and agricultural activities because of
   the varied demands and impacts on shared water resources. Successful
   governance of these watersheds requires coordination among different
   activities. Recent research has highlighted the role that social
   networks between management entities can play to facilitate cross-scale
   interaction in watershed governance. For example, bridging organizations
   can be positioned in social networks to bridge local initiatives done by
   single municipalities across whole watersheds. To better understand the
   role of social networks in social-ecological system dynamics, we combine
   a social network analysis of the water quality management networks held
   by local governments with a social-ecological analysis of variation in
   water management and ecosystem services across the Monteregie, an
   agricultural landscape near Montreal, Quebec, Canada. We analyze
   municipal water management networks by using one-mode networks to
   represent direct collaboration between municipalities, and two-mode
   networks to capture how bridging organizations indirectly connect
   municipalities. We find that municipalities do not collaborate directly
   with one another but instead are connected via bridging organizations
   that span the water quality management network. We also discovered that
   more connected municipalities engaged in more water management
   activities. However, bridging organizations preferentially connected
   with municipalities that used more tourism related ecosystem services
   rather than those that used more agricultural ecosystem services. Many
   agricultural municipalities were relatively isolated, despite being the
   main producers of water quality problems. In combination, these findings
   suggest that further strengthening the water management network in the
   Monteregie will contribute to improving water quality in the region.
   However, such strengthening requires developing a network that better
   connects both agricultural and tourism oriented municipalities.
   Furthermore, these findings show that consideration of the
   social-ecological context of social networks, can help explain the
   structure of networks and reveal social-ecological clusters and
   disconnects in a network.},

Title = {Linking Bayesian and agent-based models to simulate complex
   social-ecological systems in semi-arid regions},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {3},
Abstract = {Interdependencies of ecologic, hydrologic, and social systems challenge
   traditional approaches to natural resource management in semi-arid
   regions. As a complex social-ecological system, water demands in the
   Sonoran Desert from agricultural and urban users often conflicts with
   water needs for its ecologically-significant riparian corridors. To
   explore this system, we developed an agent-based model to simulate
   complex feedbacks between human decisions and environmental conditions
   in the Rio Sonora Watershed. Cognitive mapping in conjunction with
   stakeholder participation produced a Bayesian model of conditional
   probabilities of local human decision-making processes resulting to
   changes in water demand. Probabilities created in the Bayesian model
   were incorporated into the agent-based model, so that each agent had a
   unique probability to make a positive decision based on its perceived
   environment at each point in time and space. By using a Bayesian
   approach, uncertainty in the human decision-making process could be
   incorporated. The spatially-explicit agent-based model simulated changes
   in depth-to-groundwater by well pumping based on an agent's water
   demand. Changes in depth-to-groundwater feedback to influence agent
   behavior, as well as determine unique vegetation classes within the
   riparian corridor. Each vegetation class then provides varying
   stakeholder-defined quality values of ecosystem services. Using this
   modeling approach allowed us to examine effects on both the ecological
   and social system of semi-arid riparian corridors under various
   scenarios. The insight provided by the model contributes to
   understanding how specific interventions may alter the complex
   social-ecological system in the future.},

Abstract = {In Azraq in Eastern Jordan, farmers, domestic users, and a wetland
   ecosystem compete for and overexploit limited groundwater resources.
   Current studies explain parts of the problem, but do not take a
   comprehensive social-ecological systems perspective and tend to miss
   underlying hidden factors. To explain decision-making in this complex
   social-ecological system, we combine the concept of networks of action
   situations (NAS) with the political economy concept of the social
   contract. While the NAS allows a systematic exploration of the system,
   the concept of the social contract allows a deeper understanding of how
   informal institutions and power influence the system. Besides a
   comprehensive literature review, we draw on social network mapping and
   67 semi-structured interviews with relevant stakeholders. We find that
   the main conflict arises between a heterogeneous group of farmers, who
   use groundwater for irrigation agriculture supported by a strong
   political lobby, and the water authorities, which rely on the aquifer
   for domestic water supply at national level. The original wetland with
   its diverse ecosystem services has largely disappeared and its remainder
   is maintained artificially. Our analysis reveals that a diversity of
   action situations, including water, agricultural, environmental, energy,
   and land governance, but also the monarchy's underlying social contract
   and the informal concept of wasta, influence outcomes on the ground. We
   show that no panacea exists, but that systems thinking may help identify
   a range of intervention points, some more sensitive than others, that
   could support a social-ecological transformation towards sustainability.},

Title = {Historical, contemporary, and future perspectives on a coupled
   social-ecological system in a changing world: Canada's historic Rideau
   Canal},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {30},
Number = {1},
Pages = {72-87},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Anthropogenic waterways and canal systems have been part of the cultural
   and natural landscape for thousands for years. As of the late 20th
   century, more than 63 000 km of canals exist worldwide as transport
   routes for navigation, many with barriers (e.g., locks, dams) that
   fragment the system and decrease connectivity. Fragmentation alone can
   have negative implications for freshwater biodiversity; by isolating
   populations and communities, other human-mediated disturbances
   associated with canals like poor water quality and invasive species can
   exacerbate these negative effects. As such, the capacity of these
   interconnected freshwater systems to support biodiversity is
   continuously degrading at a global level. One critical, highly complex
   issue that unites canals worldwide is the challenge of governing these
   systems in a holistic, unified way to both protect biodiversity and
   preserve historical elements. Managing historic canals involves multiple
   objectives across many agencies and stakeholders, often with different
   or conflicting objectives. Here, we use the Rideau Canal, a UNESCO World
   Heritage Site and National Historic Site of Canada, as a case study to
   demonstrate the importance of considering canals as social-ecological
   systems for effective and efficient governance. Historic canals are
   integrated systems of both humans (social) and the environment
   (ecological), linked by mutual feedbacks and coevolution, and must be
   managed as such to achieve conservation goals while maintaining
   commemorative integrity. We discuss the history of the Rideau Canal and
   its current governance, biodiversity in the waterway, different threats
   and issues (user conflicts, aquatic pollution, shoreline development,
   water management, species at risk, and invasive species), and conclude
   by outlining ways to address the challenges of managing it as a coupled
   social-ecological system. We present different research needs and
   opportunities that would enable better management, though above all, we
   propose a shift from the current governance structure - which at best
   can be considered ``patchwork{''} - to a coordinated, multi-scalar and
   multi-stakeholder governance regime such that the Rideau Canal can be
   maintained for its historical integrity without compromising
   biodiversity conservation. Given that canals are now pervasive
   worldwide, this article is not only topical to the Rideau Canal, but
   also to other waterways in Canada and beyond.},

Title = {Social-ecological assessment of Lake Manyara basin, Tanzania: A mixed
   method approach},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {267},
Month = {AUG 1},
Abstract = {The social-ecological system of the Lake Manyara basin (Northern
   Tanzania), a UNESCO Biosphere reserve (BR) suffers from social-economic
   and environmental problems due to decreasing water levels, erosion and
   land and water use conflicts. We propose an integrated assessment of the
   social-ecological interactions of the area to support future sustainable
   management. Within the Drivers-Pressures-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR)
   framework an integrated literature review and several methods of
   knowledge collection were combined to identify future management
   priorities and challenges. During focus groups with farmers and
   pastoralists, stakeholders confirmed the role played by land use changes
   as driver and pressure in the landscape, e.g. through increased erosion
   rates and siltation of the lake. Moreover, economic and social issues
   were identified as prominent factors being influenced by, or influencing
   these processes. These statements match the scientific literature.
   During participatory mapping exercises different spatial and resource
   allocation perceptions appeared amongst pastoralists and farmers. The
   multidisciplinary approach proved to be useful to acquire an integrated
   and comprehensive understanding of the state, challenges and
   opportunities of Lake Manyara BR, to feed into a decision support system
   in service of an integrated management plan. Our assessment suggests
   that improved water governance in a multi-actor approach (with a focus
   on distribution of benefits, rights, and a specific role of the water
   authorities) should be a priority for future integrated management
   strategies. Also, awareness raising amongst decision makers, scientists
   and local communities is needed to demonstrate the advantages of an
   integrated approach. And finally, visible and fair mechanisms to share
   conservation revenues should be designed in a way that local benefits
   can be obtained together with incentive mechanisms for co-management and
   conservation.},

Abstract = {In this study we analyse how three cities in the arid Americas have
   addressed urban growth while facing water scarcity: Hermosillo, Mexico;
   Mendoza, Argentina; and Tucson, USA. We use the urban water security
   framework to examine five domains of water management: sociodemographic,
   economic, technological, ecological and governance (SETEG). Our analysis
   indicates that, in spite of water scarcity, urban growth has been
   promoted in the three cities. We argue that this expansion, although
   encouraged for economic development, is not sustainable in the long
   term. In the three cities, groundwater plays a major role in water
   supply, but growth has negatively affected riparian ecosystems, the
   health of the aquifers and access to domestic water. In order to pursue
   water security, several options are essential to enhance
   social-ecological system resilience. These include limits or reduction
   of urban expansion, reuse of treated effluent for riparian conservation,
   and community conservation efforts such as rainwater harvesting and
   other green infrastructure practices.},

Title = {From policy design to implementation: an institutional analysis of the
   new Nicaraguan Water Law},
Journal = {WATER POLICY},

Volume = {16},

Abstract = {The objective of this paper is to identify the type of barriers related
   to the implementation of a new Water Law in Nicaragua. By exploring the
   perceptions of 40 actors involved in the drafting process of the Law,
   this paper finds that major barriers are related to the power
   configuration of the water administration set-up, which creates
   conflicts of competences within government and at local and national
   levels. Our research suggests that decision-making is highly
   centralized, whereas local governments remain unpowered despite their
   relevant role in water management. One of the particular novel aspects
   of this paper is the linking of interview data to grammarcoded
   institutional statements along the social-ecological systems' variables.
   The institutional grammar tool is used to identify the institutional
   statements of the Nicaraguan Water Law and to connect the interview
   results to the institutional configuration of the Water Law. This allows
   us to understand to what extent the Water Law modifies both the formal
   and informal institutions that are in place.},

Title = {Integrating social-ecological system into watershed ecosystem services
   management: A case study of the Jialing River Basin, China},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {160},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {A severe decline in ecosystem services (ES) has accompanied the rapid
   development of human societies. There is a growing interest in
   considering ES management from a systemic and integrated perspective.
   Yet, researchers still need to explore effective ways to integrate human
   and natural systems for strengthening ES. This study proposes an
   integrating framework that connects the concept of social-ecological
   system (SES) with ES. We utilize land use types as indicators of basic
   SES structure and employ the InVEST model to evaluate typical ES in the
   Jialing River Basin (JRB). By analyzing spatial and temporal
   characteristics of SES and multiple typical ES, we investigate how ES is
   related to different SES types. The results reveal that: (1) from 1980
   to 2020, the SES of the JRB underwent significant transformations,
   including a decrease in cropland areas, while construction land and
   forestland areas increased. Especially, construction land SES
   experienced an increase as high as 212.53\%. (2) Regarding ES, water
   yield (WY) increased while soil conservation (SC), carbon storage (CS),
   and habitat quality (HQ) decreased. (3) The relationship analysis
   demonstrated disparities in levels of ES across various SES types.
   Construction land SES exhibited the highest average WY but lower SC, CS,
   and HQ values compared to forestland which had higher average SC, CS,
   and HQ instead. These findings imply that regional ES will be positively
   or negatively affected by transformation within SES. In the long run, it
   is crucial to synthesize both the characteristics of SES and functional
   benefits provided by ES in the JRB, then control the favorable
   transformations within SES to enhance a sustainable supply of ES. This
   study provides a novel methodology for connecting SES and ES
   comprehensively with new perspectives that will be beneficial for
   building regional SES management and ES enhancement.},

Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {19},
Number = {4},
Abstract = {A social-ecological system (SES) framework increasingly underpins the
   ``resilience paradigm.{''} As with all models, the SES comes with
   particular biases. We explore these key biases. We critically examine
   how the SES resilience literature has attempted to define and analyze
   the social arena. We argue that much SES literature defines people's
   interests and livelihoods as concerned primarily with the environment,
   and thereby underplays the role of other motivations and social
   institutions. We also highlight the SES resilience literature's focus on
   institutions and organized social units, which misses key aspects of
   social diversity and power. Our key premise is the importance of
   inter-and multi-disciplinary perspectives. To illustrate this, we draw
   attention to the critique of earlier ecological anthropology that
   remains relevant for current conceptualizations of SESs, focusing on the
   concepts of social diversity and power. And we discuss insights from
   social anthropology and political ecology that have responded to this
   critique to develop different ways of incorporating social diversity and
   power into human-environment relations. Finally, we discuss how these
   social science perspectives can help improve the understanding of the
   ``social{''} in SES resilience research.},

Abstract = {One environmental solution proposed by scholars since the 1980s is to
   manage our common natural resources adaptively with emphasis on
   feedback, the inclusion of multiple stakeholders and the flexibility to
   change accordingly. By focusing the analysis on the understudied topic
   of urban river systems in adaptive governance, a systematic literature
   review and a scenario-building exercise were conducted. Whereas the
   bibliometric analysis aims to improve our collective knowledge on many
   aspects of the adaptive management in urban stream governance, the urban
   commoning scenario-building exercise is to simulate alternatives beyond
   conventional top-down management approaches and to explore different
   opportunities of engaging multiple stakeholders throughout the adaptive
   management cycle. Our investigations recommend that although there is a
   trend of considering the ``human{''} or ``soft{''} perspective as part
   of the integrated solution approach, future researches need to ground
   their studies in more empirical cases in order to identify a few
   contextual variables such as ICT or public-private collaboration
   arrangement to leverage the complex inputs of soft power as benefits and
   added value in the management of urban river as a social-ecological
   system.},

Journal = {FISHERIES RESEARCH},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {194},
Pages = {31-41},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Angler groups and water-body types interact to create a complex
   social-ecological system. Network analysis could inform detailed
   mechanistic models on, and provide managers better information about,
   basic patterns of fishing activity. Differences in behavior and
   reservoir selection among angler groups in a regional fishery, the Salt
   Valley fishery in southeastern Nebraska, USA, were assessed using a
   combination of cluster and network analyses. The four angler groups
   assessed ranged from less active, unskilled anglers (group One) to
   highly active, very skilled anglers (group Four). Reservoir use patterns
   and the resulting network communities of these four angler groups
   differed; the number of reservoir communities for these groups ranged
   from two to three and appeared to be driven by reservoir location (group
   One), reservoir size and its associated attributes (groups Two and
   Four), or an interaction between reservoir size and location (group
   Three). Network analysis is a useful tool to describe differences in
   participation among angler groups within a regional fishery, and
   provides new insights about possible recruitment of anglers. For
   example, group One anglers fished reservoirs closer to home and had a
   greater probability of dropping out if local reservoir access were
   restricted.},

Title = {Congruence of appropriation and provision in collective water provision
   in Central Namibia},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE COMMONS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Pages = {71-118},
Abstract = {Achieving cooperation in natural resource management is always a
   challenge when incentives exist for an individual to maximise her short
   term benefits at the cost of a group. We study a public good social
   dilemma in water infrastructure provision on land reform farms in
   Namibia. In the context of the Namibian land reform, arbitrarily mixed
   groups of livestock farmers have to share the operation and maintenance
   of water infrastructure. Typically, water is mainly used for livestock
   production, and livestock numbers are subject to high fluctuations due
   to the given environmental conditions. Our paper assesses how
   alternative payment systems with differing congruence of provision and
   appropriation support the cooperation in the group given the
   ever-changing equilibria. In a first step, we conducted an exploratory
   overview of the social-ecological system of central Namibian land reform
   projects. The Social Ecological System (SES) Framework served as a
   guideline for this assessment (Ostrom 2009). Taking the complexity of
   the cooperation situation into account, in the second step we designed a
   role-play that is based on a social-ecological simulation model. The
   role-play simulates the real-life decision situations of land reform
   beneficiaries wherein equilibria are permanently changing. This approach
   helped us to not only better understand the cooperation challenges of
   Namibian land reform beneficiaries, but also supported stakeholders in
   their decision making and institution building. Our study provides
   evidence to support that land reform beneficiaries increase their
   contributions as they own more livestock and as other group members
   increase their payments. Nevertheless, only groups with relatively
   homogeneous livestock endowments manage to agree on payment rules.
   Interestingly, the dominant rule is an ``equal payment per farmer{''}
   and not a ``payment per head of livestock{''}, though the latter would
   imply a higher congruence of provision and appropriation.},

Title = {Environmental flows in the Rio Grande - Rio Bravo basin},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {27},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The Rio Grande/Bravo is an arid river basin shared by the United States
   and Mexico, the fifth-longest river in North America, and home to more
   than 10.4 million people. By crossing landscapes and political
   boundaries, the Rio Grande/Bravo brings together cultures, societies,
   ecosystems, and economies, thereby forming a complex social-ecological
   system. The Rio Grande/Bravo supplies water for the human activities
   that take place within its territory. While there have been efforts to
   implement environmental flows (flows necessary to sustain riparian and
   aquatic ecosystems and human activities), a systematic and whole-basin
   analysis of these efforts that conceptualizes the Rio Grande/Bravo as a
   single, complex social-ecological system is missing. Our objective is to
   address this research and policy gap and shed light on challenges,
   opportunities, and success stories for implementing environmental flows
   in the Rio Grande/Bravo. We introduce the physical characteristics of
   the basin and summarize the environmental flows studies already done. We
   also describe its water governance framework and argue it is a
   distributed and nested governance system across multiple political
   jurisdictions and spatial scales. We describe the environmental flows
   legal framework and argue that the authority over different aspects of
   environmental flows is divided across different agencies and
   institutions. We discuss the prioritization of agricultural use within
   the governance structure without significant provisions for
   environmental flows. We introduce success stories for implementing
   environmental flows that include leasing of water rights or voluntary
   releases for environmental flow purposes, municipal ordinances to secure
   water for environmental flows, nongovernmental organizations
   representing the environment in decision-making processes, and acquiring
   water rights for environmental flows, among others initiatives. We
   conclude that environmental flows are possible and have been implemented
   but their implementation has not been systematic and permanent. There is
   an emerging whole-basin thinking among scientists, managers, and

Abstract = {In this study we hypothesize that Ostrom's social-ecological system
   (SES) framework can be useful to address the introduction pathways and
   dispersal vectors of non-native species. We have applied this framework
   to the introduction of the Asian clam Corbicula fluminea in freshwaters
   in Galicia (Spain). We reviewed scientific and grey literature and
   performed a series of interviews with key stakeholders. This
   information, coupled with an extensive survey campaign, provided an
   updated C. fluminea distribution map. Using a Principal Component
   Analysis and pair-wise correlations we analyzed a set of 18 social,
   ecological, economic and governance variables and related them to the
   total number of water bodies invaded by C. fluminea in Galicia. Our
   field data on C. fluminea distribution indicated a mean upstream spread
   of 3.6kmyr(-1). We suggest that the total number of water bodies invaded
   by C. fluminea in Galician freshwaters is mainly linked to the following
   variables of the social (higher education level and mass media news),
   ecological (endangered freshwater species, scientific publications,
   dams, wastewater treatment plants, livestock, and agricultural lands),
   economic (gross domestic product, gross imports, and industrial
   productivity index) and governance (surveillance, legislative
   instruments and non-governmental organizations) dimensions. The SES
   framework has been useful in identifying introduction pathways and
   dispersal vectors of non-native species. We encourage decision-makers to
   get involved in real implementation of legislative instruments and
   management plans that will be benefitted by collaborating efforts
   between stakeholders.},

Abstract = {The management of Lake Okeechobee in Florida has undergone significant
   changes in the last decade. Socio-political, environmental and
   demographic factors have driven changes in the environmental and water
   policy, which in turn have led to wide-ranging institutional changes and
   a shift toward multiobjective planning and implementation in the Lake
   management. This article describes the changes in the philosophy and
   practice of water resources management in South Florida hydrologic
   system, of which Lake Okeechobee is a crucial component. The impacts of
   the changes on management goals and decision processes are illustrated
   through a case study of the use of climate information in Lake
   management. The article concludes with a brief examination of the
   implications of the institutional changes, including greater public
   participation, for the long-term sustainability of the social-ecological
   system in South Florida.},

Abstract = {Managing transboundary river basins requires balancing tradeoffs of
   sustainable water use and coping with climate uncertainty. We
   demonstrate an integrated approach to exploring these issues through the
   lens of a social-ecological system, combining remote and in-situ earth
   observations, hydrologic and climate models, and social surveys.
   Specifically, we examine how climate change and dam development could
   impact the Se Kong, Se San and Sre Pok rivers in the Mekong region. We
   find that climate change will lead to increased precipitation,
   necessitating a shift in dam operations, from maintaining low flows to
   reducing flood hazards. We also find that existing water governance
   systems in Laos, Vietnam, and Cambodia are ill-prepared to address the
   problem. We conclude that the solution space for addressing these
   complex issues will be highly constrained unless major deficiencies in
   transboundary water governance, strategic planning, financial capacity,
   information sharing, and law enforcement are remedied in the next
   decades.},

   to explore and understand social and ecological interactions, and
   pathways in water governance. However, it lacks a robust understanding
   of change. We argue an analytical and methodological approach to
   engaging global changes in SES is critical to strengthening the scope
   and relevance of the SES framework. Relying on SES and resilience
   thinking, we propose an institutional and cognitive model of change
   where institutions and natural resources systems co-evolve. Our model of
   change provides a dynamic understanding of SES that stands on three
   causal mechanisms: institutional complexity trap, rigidity trap, and
   learning processes. We illustrate how data cube technology could
   overcome current limitations and offer reliable avenues for testing
   hypotheses about the dynamics of Social-Ecological Systems and water
   security by offering to combine spatial and time data with no major

Abstract = {In February and March 2017, a coastal El Nino caused extraordinary heavy
   rains and a rise in water temperatures along the coast of northern Peru.
   In this work, we document the impacts of this phenomenon on the
   artisanal fisheries and the scallop aquaculture sector, both of which
   represent important socio-economic activities for the province of
   Sechura. Despite the perceived absence of effective disaster management
   and rehabilitation policies, resource users opted for a wide range of
   different adaptation strategies and are currently striving towards
   recovery. One year after the event, the artisanal fisheries fleet has
   returned to operating almost on a normal scale, while the aquaculture
   sector is still drastically impacted, with many people continuing to
   work in different economic sectors and even in other regions of the
   country. Recovery of the social-ecological system of Sechura likely
   depends on the occurrence of scallop seed and the financial capacity of
   small-scale producers to reinitiate scallop cultures. Long-term
   consequences of this coastal El Nino are yet to be studied, though the
   need to develop trans-local and trans-sectoral management strategies for
   coping with disturbance events of this scale is emphasized.},

Title = {Collective action as a tool for agri-environmental policy
   implementation. The case of diffuse pollution control in European rural
   areas},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {280},
Month = {FEB 15},
Abstract = {In the European Union (EU) context, regulatory instruments and incentive
   schemes targeting individual farms remain the main policy instruments
   implemented to control diffuse pollution from agriculture. Yet,
   collective approaches to policy implementation have been recently
   developing. This article aims at assessing the potential for hybrid
   policy instruments relying on collective action among farmers to limit
   diffuse nitrate pollution from agriculture. Transaction cost economics
   are used to assess the potential advantages of collective action as a
   complement to regulatory and incentive policy tools. The conditions
   under which such hybrid forms of governance may be successful are
   identified using the Social-Ecological System (SES) framework. A review
   of empirical studies documenting cases of collective action for policy
   implementation in the EU context serves as a basis for the
   identification of the factors likely to affect the potential of
   collective approaches for water quality management in agriculture. The
   analysis relies more particularly on two cases: the Environmental
   Cooperatives in the Netherlands and the ``Ferti-Mieux{''} operations in
   France. The results suggest that collective action is a relevant tool to
   consider for improving the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of
   policies targeting diffuse pollution from agriculture. In particular,
   relying on farmers' cooperation for policy implementation may be
   associated with advantages in terms of transaction costs. However, such
   advantages will be effective under a number of conditions related to the
   characteristics of the water resource, the actors involved, the
   governance of cooperation and the broader economic and institutional
   contexts.},

Title = {Reimagining large-scale open-water fisheries governance through adaptive
   comanagement in hilsa shad sanctuaries},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {23},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Almost a half million fishers in Bangladesh are predominantly reliant on
   the hilsa shad (Tenualosa ilisha) fishery in the Meghna River and
   estuarine ecosystem. This paper adopts a broadened concept of
   social-ecological traps to frame the complex dynamics that emerge from
   social and ecological interactions in this highly natural
   resource-dependent social-ecological system (SES). We analyze how
   endogenous self-reinforcing processes in the system and poor initial
   conditions, particularly debt and lack of livelihood options outside
   fisheries, keep fishing households in poverty. We identify a policy
   decision in favor of incentive-based fisheries management as a critical
   juncture that influenced a trajectory of recovery in hilsa shad stocks
   in this complex adaptive system. Normative assessment of stakeholder
   perceptions indicates that fishers perceive a nominal improvement in
   well-being as a result of this policy. Compensation in return for
   compliance with a seasonal fishing ban in sanctuary areas does not,
   however, disrupt trap dynamics perpetuating the cycle of poverty, social
   exclusion, and political disempowerment in which fishing households are
   entrenched. Poverty and lack of alternative livelihood opportunities
   remain significant reasons for noncompliance with the ban as long as
   fishers do not have any meaningful representation in resource management
   and decision making. A secured tenure system through adaptive
   comanagement involving fishers in monitoring and enforcement of
   compliance with fishing bans, supported by sustainable finance for
   livelihood improvements outside of natural resource exploitation and
   predicated on responsive and accountable institutions for and by people
   who depend on the fishery, can form the foundation for local stewardship
   in a unique demonstration of contemporary large-scale open-water
   fisheries governance in this complex SES.},

Title = {Regional complex system simulation optimization through linking
   governance and environment performance: A case study of water
   environmental carrying capacity based on the SDES model},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REVIEW},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {104},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The resolution of issues related to sustainable development in regions
   and urbans is closely related to the complex systems, which lie not only
   in the numerous subsystems and spatial hierarchy, but also in the
   complex relationships between humans, socioeconomic, environmental and
   governance.The system dynamics (SD) model has been widely used in
   modeling regional and urban complex systems which involve
   multi-dimensional socio-economic and environmental issues. However, most
   simulations have focused on the state variables, such as the end-state
   social-economic and environmental situation, while the interaction
   between governance and their consequences on complex systems has been
   scarce. In addition, the social-ecological system (SES) framework has
   been endorsed worldwide because of its ability to explicitly recognize
   the complex interactions among socioeconomic-ecological-governance
   subsystems. To date, there have been few studies that combine the SES
   framework and complex systems models to quantitatively simulate the
   environmental performance of governance. In this research, we try to
   fill this gap by combining both to create a SDES model to quantitatively
   simulate the impacts of stakeholders' actions on environmental
   performance, and the feasibility of SDES model is verified by simulating
   the impacts of stakeholders' actions on water environment carrying
   capacity (WECC) in Liyang City, China. Moreover, we establish a
   cost-benefit analytical framework to identify the most cost-effective
   action to improve WECC based on the SDES model. Findings of this
   research contribute new theoretical and methodological insights into
   addressing environmental issues while we are facing a more complex
   regional and urban system and fragmented governance.},

Abstract = {This study aims at exploring ways of increasing adaptive capacity and
   reducing vulnerability of farmers in the face of water scarcity through
   establishing a link between social network indicators and the dimensions
   of adaptive capacity. For this purpose, a Social Network Analysis (SNA)
   model along with a Structural Equation Model was developed to
   investigate the effects of SNA indices on the dimensions influencing the
   adaptive capacity of the water users in rural areas in the west of Iran.
   The developed model links participation in production and knowledge
   exchange with ten critical dimensions identified to affect the adaptive
   capacities of water resources users. The results indicated that the most
   important subdimensions affecting adaptive capacity were governance,
   innovation, and awareness. Also, the positive effects of individual and
   whole network level of indices on the adaptive capacity indicated high
   coherence in the study area and the ability of people to develop social
   learning to improve the adaptive capacity.},

Abstract = {In a multi-reservoir system, ensuring adequate water availability across
   reservoirs while managing conflicting goals under uncertainties are
   critical to making the social-ecological system sustainable. The
   priorities of multiple user-groups and availability of the water
   resource may vary with time, weather and other factors. Uncertainties
   such as variation in precipitation bring more complexity, which
   intensifies the discrepancies between water supply and water demand for
   each user-group. To reduce such discrepancies, we should satisfice
   conflicting goals, considering typical uncertainties.
   We observed that models are incomplete and inaccurate, which challenge
   the use of the single optimal solution to be robust to uncertainties.
   So, we explore satisficing solutions that are relatively insensitive to
   uncertainties, by incorporating different design preferences,
   identifying sensitive segments and improving the design accordingly.
   This work is an example of exploring the solution space to enhance
   sustainability in multi-disciplinary systems, when goals conflict,
   preferences are evolving, and uncertainties add complexity.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {61},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Three decades of economy growth and urbanization has brought China into
   the rim of water crisis. Transition to sustainability has gained
   consensus and put into practice at all administrative levels. However,
   due to locking mechanisms such as sunken investments, vested interests,
   and economic structure, such transition would not prove to be easy. Here
   we adopt the Multi-Level Perspective framework to analyze a county level
   water regime shift in Yiwu of Zhejiang province, which is representative
   for its economic success and severity of water problem in China. The
   transition is described as the interactions between water regime
   subsystems including society, economy, administration, infrastructure,
   and natural water cycling process, as well as the influence from the
   landscape level such as politics. Figures show that the water system is
   making a turnaround to the better side, while the government plays a key
   role in pushing and managing the transition. This study allows us to
   have a glimpse of the whole water regime transition currently happening
   in China, as well as being used for reference in other parts of the
   developing world, for the promoting of sustainable water resource
   management. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {The controversial debate on the role of water reservoirs in reducing
   water scarcity},
Journal = {WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-WATER},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Reservoirs are built worldwide for a higher water supply in dry periods
   by storing water temporarily in wet periods. Recent socio-hydrology
   studies hypothesized, by creating ``supply-demand cycles{''}, that
   reservoirs can lead indirectly to counterintuitive dynamics such as more
   water scarcity and a higher economic and social vulnerability. This
   opinion argues that reservoirs are part of co-evolutionary processes
   with natural, social, and engineered elements and therefore, water
   scarcity need to be analyzed within socio-political interactions.
   Aspects such as (a) institutions; (b) governance processes; (c)
   social-ecological factors; (d) narratives of water scarcity; and (e)
   powerful economic interests are essential to understand feedback
   mechanisms between reservoirs and water scarcity and to hypothesize
   long-term phenomena such as water scarcity. Neglecting these
   interactions could lead to biased research agendas, misleading
   conclusions, and adverse effects on the transformation process toward
   sustainability. Given the complexity of social-ecological systems, the
   diversity and critical capacity of inter- and transdisciplinary work is
   crucial to further advance the study of unintended side effects of
   reservoirs or - more general - the study of socio-hydrology.

Title = {Enhancing the Ostrom social-ecological system framework through
   formalization},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {19},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {Frameworks play an important role in analyzing social-ecological systems
   (SESs) because they provide shared concepts and variables that enable
   comparison between and accumulation of knowledge across multiple cases.
   One prominent SES framework focusing on local resource use has been
   developed by Elinor Ostrom and her colleagues. This framework is an
   extensive multi-tier collection of concepts and variables that have
   demonstrated relevance for explaining outcomes in a large number of case
   studies in the context of fishery, water, and forestry common-pool
   resources. The further development of this framework has raised a number
   of issues related to the formal relationships between the large number
   of concepts and variables involved. In particular, issues related to
   criteria for ordering the concepts into tiers, adding new concepts,
   defining outcomes metrics, and representing dynamics in the framework
   have been identified. We address these issues by applying methods from
   research fields that study formal relationships between concepts such as
   domain-specific languages, knowledge representation, and software
   engineering. We find that SES frameworks could include the following
   seven formal components: variables, concepts, attribution relationships,
   subsumption relationships, process relationships, aggregation
   relationships, and evaluation metrics. Applying these components to the
   Ostrom framework and a case study of recreational fishery, we find that
   they provide clear criteria for structuring concepts into tiers,
   defining outcome metrics, and representing dynamics. The components
   identified are generic, and the insights gained from this exercise may
   also be beneficial for the development of other SES frameworks.},

Title = {A social-ecological systems approach for the assessment of ecosystem
   services from beef production in the Canadian prairie},
Journal = {ECOSYSTEM SERVICES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {45},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Producing food to meet rising global demand requires a more thorough
   understanding of how farming systems can ensure food security without
   compromising economic, environmental, and social sustainability. This
   dilemma can be addressed through a social-ecological systems approach to
   ecosystem service assessment, which assesses the linkages between the
   different components of an agricultural social-ecological system - beef
   production in the Canadian Prairies. Using this framework, we documented
   the relationships between governance and management, social and
   ecological structures and processes, ecosystem services and human
   well-being for these systems. We also examined how this framework could
   aid in the greater integration of ecosystem services into
   decision-making and management practices for these systems. The
   framework was applied to all stages of the prairie beef production
   cycle, consisting of the cow-calf, backgrounding, finishing and feed
   production stages. The benefits, shortcomings and limitations of such an
   approach as well as the state of knowledge on relationships between the
   components of the system are discussed, and recommendations for future
   research directions, farm management strategies and policy are proposed.
   Overall, the high degree of heterogeneity in biophysical and
   socio-economic conditions across the prairie landscape underscores the
   need for more site-specific ecosystem service assessments and
   environmental stewardship policies that are tailored to these specific
   contexts.},

Title = {Multi-Scale Integrated Analysis of Charcoal Production in Complex
   Social-Ecological Systems},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {5},
Abstract = {We propose and illustrate a multi-scale integrated analysis of societal
   and ecosystem metabolism (MuSIASEM) as a tool to bring nexus thinking
   into practice. MuSIASEM studies the relations over the structural and
   functional components of social-ecological systems that determine the
   entanglement of water, energy, and food flows in a complex metabolic
   pattern. MuSIASEM simultaneously considers various dimensions and
   multiple scales of analysis and therefore avoids the predicament of
   quantitative analysis based on reductionism (one dimension and one scale
   at the time). The different functional elements of society (the parts)
   are characterized using the concept of ``processor,{''} that is, a
   profile of expected inputs and outputs associated with the expression of
   a specific function. The processors of the functional elements of the
   social-ecological system can be either scaled-up to describe the
   metabolic pattern of the system as a whole, or scaled-down by
   considering the characteristics of its lower-level parts-i.e., the
   different processors associated with the structural elements required to
   express the specific function. An analysis of functional elements
   provides insight in the socio-economic factors that pose internal
   constraints on the development of the system. An analysis of structural
   elements makes it possible to study the compatibility of the system with
   external constraints (availability of natural resources and ecological
   services) in spatial terms. The usefulness of the approach is
   illustrated in relation to an example of the use of charcoal in a rural
   village of Laos.},

Abstract = {The impact of Hurricane Sandy on the Hudson-Raritan estuary (HRE)
   provided a valuable case study for exploring interactions between
   long-term environmental degradation, new climatic disturbance stressors,
   and human behavioral responses. We extend previous research on the
   ecological effects of major storms to compare water quality and
   biological parameters three years before and three years after Hurricane
   Sandy and consider how ecosystem shifts relate to anglers' perceptions.
   Results indicate that water clarity and nutrients returned to pre-storm
   conditions in about one year, while shifts in the biological community,
   including a significant increase in harmful algal species and declines
   in zooplankton and Atlantic menhaden, persisted for multiple years, and
   anglers continued to fish amidst ecosystem decline. Biotic recovery time
   in the HRE was longer than reports for other shallow estuaries
   frequently disturbed by hurricanes. Ecological and social responses
   suggest that the post-storm regime shifts and continued fishing pressure
   could further environmental degradation.},

Title = {Managing Conflicting Water Resource Goals and Uncertainties in a Dam
   Network by Exploring the Solution Space},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {141},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {In a multireservoir system, ensuring adequate water availability while
   managing conflicting goals is critical to making the social-ecological
   system sustainable in the presence of considerable uncertainty. The
   priorities of multiple user groups and availability of the water
   resource vary with time, weather, and other factors. Uncertainties such
   as variations in precipitation can intensify the discrepancies between
   water supply and water demand. To reduce such discrepancies, we seek to
   satisfice conflicting goals, considering typical uncertainties. We
   observe that models are incomplete and inaccurate, which calls into
   question using a single point solution and suggests the need for
   solutions, which are robust to uncertainties. So, we explore satisficing
   solutions that are relatively insensitive to uncertainties, by
   incorporating different design preferences, identifying sensitive
   segments, and improving the design accordingly. In this article, we
   present an example of the exploration of the solution space to enhance
   sustainability in multidisciplinary systems, when goals conflict,
   preferences are evolving, and uncertainties add complexity, which can be
   applied in mechanical design. In this paper, we focus on the method
   rather than the results.},

Abstract = {The multiple effects of ecosystem restoration programmes deserve
   attention. After reviewing the social-ecological effects of 23 ecosystem
   restoration programs in Asia's drylands, we find that these programmes
   mainly contribute to sustainable development goals (SDGs)
   synergistically, but the trade-offs between social-ecological effects
   still exist. Among the five goals of SDG15 (Life on Land), SDG13
   (Climate Action), SDG6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), SDG1 (No poverty),
   and SDG2 (Zero Hunger), 11 programs can synergistically achieve no less
   than three goals, especially grassland restoration and water diversion
   in China, as well as water management programmes in Israel. However, the
   contribution of ecosystem restoration programs to SDG15 easily weakens
   SDG6, SDG1, and SDG2, indicating the competition of land and water
   between ecosystem restoration and agriculture. To reduce the trade-offs
   among SGDs caused by ecosystem restoration, we propose the
   social-ecological system research framework of `Dryland Boundary -
   Water, Food, Energy and Ecosystem Nexus - Meta-coupling - Nature-based
   Solutions' to guide the implementation of ecosystem restoration
   programmes from four aspects: supply-demand matching, element matching,
   regional matching, and local adaptation.},

Title = {When the economic engine stalls - A multi-scale comparison of vegetation
   dynamics in pre- and post-recession Phoenix, Arizona, USA},
Journal = {LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {153},
Pages = {140-148},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Often, we think of cities as designed landscapes, where people manage
   everything from water to weeds. But we do not fully understand what
   happens to these extensively managed landscapes when there is an abrupt
   disruption in economic activity. Considering the ability of cities to
   support plant biodiversity and their importance as human habitat, we
   studied pre- and post-recession landscapes across a gradient of human
   influence by asking: How did vegetation change over time from before the
   housing bubble to after the nadir of the Great Recession? And how did
   vegetation vary across sites at regional versus residential scales? This
   investigation used long-term vegetation data to examine diversity trends
   and responses to a novel economic disturbance in, an urban
   social-ecological system. Overall, we found that plant species diversity
   increased through time across scales, while species composition
   homogenized in urban and agricultural areas. Residential yards, however,
   initially had high compositional heterogeneity which then increased over
   time. Changes in residential diversity were driven by substantial
   increases in the role of annual plants. This research improves our
   understanding of spatiotemporal vegetation dynamics in a coupled
   human-natural system, and specifically how urban vegetation dynamics are
   linked to anthropogenic influence. Ultimately, we recommend that city
   planners and managers consider economic trends when approaching
   community projects because of the interconnectedness of ecology and
   socioeconomics in urban landscapes. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {A Resilience Framework for Chronic Exposures: Water Quality and

Journal = {COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {46},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {242-258},
Abstract = {Water quality degradation is a chronic problem which influences the
   resilience of a social-ecological system differently than acute
   disturbances, such as disease or storms. Recognizing this, we developed
   a tailored resilience framework that applies ecosystem service concepts
   to coastal social-ecological systems affected by degraded water quality.
   We present the framework as a mechanism for coordinating
   interdisciplinary research to inform long-term community planning
   decisions pertaining to chronic challenges in coastal systems. The
   resulting framework connects the ecological system to the social system
   via ecological production functions and ecosystem services. The social
   system then feeds back to the ecological system via policies and
   interventions to address declining water quality. We apply our
   resilience framework to the coastal waters and communities of Cape Cod
   (Barnstable County, Massachusetts, USA) which are affected by nitrogen
   over-enrichment. This approach allowed us to design research to improve
   the understanding of the effectiveness and acceptance of water quality
   improvement efforts and their effect on the delivery of ecosystem
   services. This framework is intended to be transferable to other
   geographical settings and more generally applied to systems exposed to
   chronic disturbances in order to coordinate interdisciplinary research
   planning and inform coastal management.},

Title = {Resettlement and Climate Impact: addressing migration intention of
   resettled people in west China},
Journal = {AUSTRALIAN GEOGRAPHER},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {48},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {97-119},
Abstract = {The relationship between climate change and human displacement is an
   important topic of global concern. China is a special case due to a high
   level of government control enforcing the ecological migration of
   millions of people since the mid-1980s. Little research has addressed
   how resettled people adapt to climate impacts in ecologically vulnerable
   resettlement areas and what factors influence their intentions to
   relocate again or adapt locally. Employing a social-ecological system
   approach, this study builds a conceptual econometric framework which
   differentiates two steps that drive migration intention at the household
   level. The study uses this approach to examine the role of both
   contextual and household factors in motivating the migration intentions
   of resettled people in the largest environmental resettlement area of
   Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, China, where household survey data were
   collected in 2012. This framework enabled an analysis, first, of how
   local contextual factors and household factors shape the severity of
   climate impacts on households and, second, how these factors interact
   with the experience of climate impacts to further influence a
   household's migration intention as a response to climate impacts. The
   results show that some contextual factors (such as limited use of
   water-saving techniques, little practice of cultivating
   aridity-resistant crops, and lack of government support), strong local
   social networks and being in receipt of low rates of financial
   remittances have significant associations with adverse climate impacts
   experienced by resettled households, and also with their anticipated
   further relocation to respond to these impacts.},

Abstract = {The Yangtze River Basin faces unprecedented challenges in harmonizing
   competing interests in its ecological and social systems. The central
   government of China, in response to the need for change in governance
   arrangements and cooperation, passed the Yangtze River Protection Law.
   It is China's first legislation at the basin scale and for a specific
   river basin. Ecological disturbances caused by industrial and other
   human activity, followed by political support for environmental
   protection, catalyzed the passage of this law. As the first tentative
   effort to regulate a complex and changing social-ecological system, it
   has incorporated multiple legal and institutional design principles
   identified in the adaptive governance and law scholarship: scaled
   approaches to social-ecological systems, cooperation to address
   geographical and sectoral fragmentation, and participatory capacity.
   These commonalities show that designs are fundamental to tackle
   geographic and sectoral fragmentation of complex systems and catalyze
   the emergence of adaptive water governance.},

Journal = {APPLIED ERGONOMICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {57},
Number = {SI},
Pages = {80-93},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Human activities, such as industrial, agricultural, and domestic
   pursuits, discharge effluents into riverine ecological systems that
   contains aquatic resources, such as fish, which are also used by humans.
   We conducted case studies in Malaysia to investigate the impacts of
   these human activities on water and fish resources, as well as on human
   well-being from an ergonomics perspective. This research shows that a
   green ergonomics approach can provide us with useful insights into
   sustainable relationships between humans and ecology in facilitating
   human well-being in consideration of the overall performance of the
   social-ecological system. Heavy metal concentrations contained in the
   effluents pollute river water and contaminate fish, eventually creating
   significant health risks and economic costs for residents, including the
   polluters. The study suggests a number of policy interventions to change
   human behavior and achieve greater collaboration between various levels
   of government, academia, civil society, and businesses to help establish
   sustainable relationships between humans and ecology in Malaysia. (C)

Abstract = {The ability of resource-dependent communities to adapt to climate change
   depends in part on their perceptions and prioritization of specific
   climate-related threats. In the Maine lobster fishery, which is highly
   vulnerable to warming water associated with climate change, we found a
   strong majority (84\%) of fishers viewed warming water as a threat, but
   rank its impacts lower than other drivers of change (e.g., pollution).
   Two-thirds believed they will be personally affected by warming waters,
   but only half had plans to adapt. Those with adaptation plans
   demonstrated fundamentally different views of human agency in this
   system, observing greater anthropogenic threats, but also a greater
   ability to control the fishery through their own actions on the water
   and fisheries management processes. Lack of adaptation planning was
   linked to the view that warming waters result from natural cycles, and
   the expectation that technological advancements will help buffer the
   industry from warming waters.},

   DiGaetano and Strom's framework on urban governance to identify and

Abstract = {Global environmental change affects the intensity and frequency of
   rainfall that increases the necessity for sustainable management of
   rainwater. It is more important for rain intensive country like
   Bangladesh otherwise it creates further problems like water logging,
   flood, soil erosion, and water borne diseases. Based on the survey of 80
   rainwater harvesters in the Coastal Bangladesh in 2017, this paper
   evaluates whether rainwater harvesting is sustainable approach to govern
   rainwater or not by using social and ecological performance measures of
   Social Ecological System (SES) of Elinor Ostrom. This study found that
   rainwater harvesting does not affect environment, it is an acceptable
   approach in family and society, help to develop biodiversity condition,
   create resilience to climate change impact, improve equitable access to
   water, efficient use of rainwater, improve women performance regarding
   water supply to the family, contribute in achieving sustainable
   development goal, and do not overharvest of rainwater that could create
   environmental problem. Beyond these measures, it needs rainwater
   harvesting controlling mechanism like formal operation rule or policy to
   avoid overharvesting and ensure more sustainability in governing
   rainwater.},

Title = {Governance for adaptive capacity and resilience in the US water sector},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {23},
Number = {4},
Abstract = {Water utility managers play potentially important roles in current and
   future transitions toward more adaptive and sustainable approaches to
   water management. We report the results of qualitative interviews and
   focus groups designed to explore the perspectives of 22 water utility
   managers in the United States regarding pressures, challenges, and
   opportunities facing their organizations and communities. Overall, the
   study participants characterized their jobs as requiring a delicate
   balance between innovation and reliability, with no room for error in
   delivering abundant, clean water, but opportunities for creative
   problem-solving and forward planning. They demonstrated capacity for
   embracing changes that benefit the longer term future while imposing
   short-term costs on their own organizations. Coding of transcripts
   generated 17 major themes (11 problem categories and six solution
   categories), which overlap meaningfully with results of previous
   research on resilience, adaptability, and transformability of
   social-ecological systems. Overlapping themes include social learning
   and development of social capital through various forms of
   collaboration, communication, and citizen and stakeholder engagement, as
   well as capacity for innovation and sufficient authority to make
   decisions based on system needs without undue political interference or
   burdensome adherence to rigid rule structures.},

Abstract = {Nature-Based Solutions for Integrated Water Resources Management
   (NbS-IWRM) involve natural, or nature-mimicking, processes used to
   improve water availability in quantity and quality sustainably, reduce

   change and increase both biodiversity and the social-ecological system's
   resilience. United Nations and the European Commission promote their
   research as a cornerstone in the changeover to the Ecological
   Transition. In the Sierra Nevada range (Spain) and the Andean
   Cordillera, there is a paradigmatic and ancestral example of NbS-IWRM
   known as ``careo channels{''} and ``amunas{''}, respectively. They
   recharge slope aquifers in mountain areas and consist of an extensive
   network of channels that infiltrate the runoff water generated during
   the snow-thawing and rainy season into the upper parts of the slopes.
   The passage of water through the aquifers in the slope is used to
   regulate the water resources of the mountain areas and thus ensure the
   duration of water availability for the downstream local population and
   generate multiple ecosystem services. This form of water management is
   known as Water Sowing and Harvesting (WS\&H). As shown in this work, it
   is a living example of a resilience and climate change adaptation tool
   that can be qualified as a nature-based solution.},

Title = {Unravelling Stakeholder Perceptions to Enable Adaptive Water Governance
   in Dryland Systems},
Journal = {WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {32},
Number = {10},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Adaptive water governance seeks to increase a social-ecological system's
   adaptive capacity in the face of uncertainty and change. This is
   especially important in non-linear dryland systems that are already
   exposed to water scarcity and increasing degradation. Conservation of
   water ecosystem services is key for increasing adaptive capacity in
   drylands, however, how stakeholders perceive water ecosystem services
   greatly affects how they are managed, as well as the potential for
   adaptive water governance. This paper focuses on identifying the
   system's potential for enabling adaptive water governance by analysing
   different stakeholder perceptions on water ecosystem services. It takes
   the Rio del Carmen watershed as a case study, offering important
   insights for an increasing number of water-scarce regions.
   Semi-structured interviews were conducted with key stakeholders in the
   watershed in order to unravel their perceptions and understand the
   governance context. We found disparities in how stakeholders perceive
   water ecosystem services have led to water overexploitation and several
   conflicts over water access. Our results indicate that stakeholder
   perceptions have a major influence on the system's adaptability, as they
   shape the acquisition of water ecosystem services. Divergent stakeholder
   perceptions act as an important barrier to collaboration. Generating and
   sharing knowledge could facilitate the development of a common vision,
   allowing all actors to co-create information about water ecosystem
   services and the system state, engaging them in a participatory process,
   suitable for their context, and that will better support adaptive water
   governance.},

Abstract = {The network relations of Qanat stakeholders in Iran as an ancient type
   of water-supply system were considered with the aim of clarifying the
   societal transformation through revitalizing power dynamics. The present
   network was highlighted by the interaction of three groups of new actors

   participation ties, 2. those with high control power and high mediation
   who link small family groups and play a role in empowering individuals,
   and 3. those who have high fame and are key players by leading thoughts
   and resolving conflicts. Meanwhile, Boolean Combination Index confirms
   the increase of various quantitative indicators, such as higher
   reciprocity and transitivity of relationships and shorter geodetic and
   diameter index. This study concluded that the revival of power relations
   in a social-ecological system can be effective in changing the social

Abstract = {Global freshwater resources have faced critical water security
   challenges during the 21st century in the world's river basins.
   Shortages of water have impaired economic development by disrupting
   regimes of river flows, ecosystem functioning and food security.
   Excessive surface and groundwater withdrawals have almost reached the
   threshold. The current withdrawals of total water (4700 km(3)center dot
   y(-1)) suggest the imbalance of water use and renewal rates in the
   world's river basins. The water security issues are further intensified
   by phosphate and nitrate pollution from land use and climate change.
   Today, about 400 million people worldwide experience extreme shortages
   of water for daily use. Limited availability of water which needs to
   meet the basic needs of hygiene and sanitation for consumption and other
   uses has increased competition among users. While the society demands
   more water-intensive goods and services, the ecosystems are however left
   behind, consequently leading to increased conflicts and insecurity.
   Equitable water allocation for people and nature is becoming
   increasingly urgent. However, understanding the complex interactions
   between the society and nature in the world's river basins is limited.
   This paper aims to unravel some key strategies that enhance future water
   security through the advancement of science, knowledge and technologies
   in the world's river basins.},

Abstract = {Complex interactions between water, society, the economy, and the
   environment necessitate attention to how water issues are framed, and
   the limitations of a water-centric framework for analyzing or solving
   problems. We explore this complexity through an example of an existing
   complex, or wicked, policy problem-the case of agricultural wetland
   drainage in the Canadian Prairies. Agricultural wetland drainage expands
   the amount of productive agricultural land, increasing agricultural
   efficiency and productivity. Drainage is also one of the primary drivers
   of the loss of Canada's wetlands and is a hotly contentious issue
   between actors with divergent views and values in the Canadian Prairies.
   Using the nuances of drainage as an exemplar, we discuss how fragmented
   framings of water foster perspectives and solutions that fail to
   consider the full range of aspects and interactions, and contribute to
   the enduring conflicts that accompany drainage debates inmany regions.
   First, we discuss agricultural wetland drainage as practiced in the
   province of Saskatchewan, where significant regulatory and governance
   changes are in progress. Next, we discuss the challenges of policy and
   governance fragmentation, both specific to water and to the surrounding
   system. Finally, we note potential alternative framings that, while
   specific to prairie water governance, provide guidance for how other
   complex social-ecological challenges might be approached.},

Title = {Urbanization shifts freshwater service flows in the highly urbanized
   watersheds of Dongjiang River, China},
Journal = {APPLIED GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {161},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Freshwater ecosystem services supply and demand are important for
   achieving Sustainable Development Goal 6 of clean water. Urbanization
   has significantly impacted the supply, demand, and flow of freshwater
   ecosystem services due to various human activities. However, the changes
   in freshwater ecosystem service flow (FESF) under the influence of
   urbanization were still unclear. This study examines the highly
   urbanized Dongjiang River as an example and maps the supply-flow-demand
   network of freshwater services based on social-ecological network
   analysis. The results indicate that freshwater supply has increased by
   0.21 billion m3 per year, while there is a decreasing trend of 0.17
   billion m3 per year in demand. The FESF approach reveals that 42\%-60\%
   of imbalanced sub-watersheds rely on artificial water diversion projects
   to alleviate water deficits under dynamic flow conditions. Approximately
   15.6\% of the region experiences water insecurity, driven by
   urbanizationinduced demand for water diversion. This increased demand
   puts stress on downstream sub-watershed water supply and elevates the
   risk of flow reduction in the main stream. The study highlights the need
   for sustainable water management strategies to ensure freshwater
   security in large river basins within urbanized areas worldwide and to
   address the challenges posed by uncertain urban expansion.},

Abstract = {There are growing accounts of innovative, often collaborative
   institutional approaches to water management that seem to respond better
   to new challenges in supply and water quality management. While some
   describe these new institutional designs as a ``third way{''}, as
   opposed to traditional state-centered or market-based modes, we find
   that the most salient features of it to characterize even those
   effective state or market designs. The fundamental ingredient, which is
   patterned relationships, is one that arises when social networks are
   built around the formal (state or market) institutions. The necessary
   plane of description is not on the dimension of structure (state,
   market, or otherwise) but in the nature and workings of these relational
   networks. We describe necessary features of these networks. We
   illustrate these points with a case study: the Environmental Water
   Account (EWA), a novel market-based program for negotiating water
   allocations around the San Francisco Bay-Delta (California, U.S.A.). We
   point out how this institution worked precisely because it was not
   merely a market-based program but, rather, built in features of an
   effective social network. In this way, we found a capacity of the EWA to
   adapt to the dynamic nature of water resources and needs, along with the
   uncertainties inherent in a complex social-ecological system.},

Title = {Integrated water security and coupling of social-ecological system to
   improve river basin sustainability},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {905},
Month = {DEC 20},
Abstract = {The river basin sustainability depends on both the coordinated
   development of socio-ecological systems and resilience to water
   resources. However, the lack of integrating them on spatial and temporal
   scales compromises our capacity to develop precise interventions towards
   sustainable river basins. We developed an approach by integrating water
   security and social -ecological coupling to assess the river basin
   sustainability. We divided it into four categories including highly
   sustainable (secure and coordinated), insecure, uncoordinated, and low
   sustainable (insecure and uncoordinated). The middle reach of Heihe
   River (MHR) was taken as the study area with the sub -basin as the
   spatial analysis unit from 2000 to 2020. The results showed that there
   was heterogeneity and agglomeration in spatial distribution. 23.8 \%,
   38.8 \%, and 11\% of the sub -basins mainly clustered in the north and
   central areas were found in the state of water insecure and SES
   uncoordinated, or both respectively. The unsustainable areas (five sub
   -basins) and lose -lose areas (two sub -basins) should be the priority
   areas for management interventions. Our approach can provide an
   important reference for assessing and improving the river basin
   sustainability.},

Title = {Assessing Water Management Strategies in Data-Scarce Mountain Regions
   under Uncertain Climate and Socio-Economic Changes},
Journal = {WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 APR 13},
Abstract = {Water management in mountainous regions faces significant challenges due
   to deep uncertainties arising from data scarcity, knowledge gaps, and
   the complex interplay of climate and socio-economic changes. While
   existing approaches focused on uncertainty reduction and water system
   optimization contribute to managing uncertainties, they often require
   probability distributions that can be difficult to obtain in data-scarce
   mountain regions. To address these challenges, we demonstrate the
   effectiveness of Exploratory Modeling and Analysis (EMA) in assessing
   water management strategies and identifying operational ranges that
   avoid future water scarcity. Through a case study in the complex and
   data-scarce Peruvian Andes, we employed EMA to run 12,000 simulations by
   2050, incorporating deep uncertainties from climate and socio-economic
   scenarios, and hydrological modeling parameters. This analysis
   identified specific policy combinations demonstrating greater robustness
   across diverse scenarios and uncertainties. EMA explicitly identifies
   operational ranges of policies to avoid water scarcity but also
   highlights the conditions that might trigger policy failure. We also
   delve into the roles of the different factors used in EMA and their
   significance in water management applications. Our research illustrates
   that an exploratory hydrological modeling approach based on robust
   decision-making can foster a more informed decision-making process for
   long-term water adaptation in rapidly changing mountain regions under
   data scarcity and deep uncertainties.},

Title = {Resilience assessment of blue and green water resources for staple crop
   production in China},
Journal = {AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {288},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {Blue water (irrigation water) and green water (soil moisture), as
   natural bases in crop production, are vulnerable to natural and
   socioeconomic disturbances. However, quantitative resilience assessments
   of blue and green water for crop production are still lacking. Here we
   constructed a social-ecological based general water resilience
   assessment framework that distinguishes blue and green water for crop
   production in four dimensions, including resistance, absorptive
   capacity, adaptive capacity and transformative capacity. The framework
   was applied to quantify the spatiotemporal characteristics of water
   resource resilience for three staple crops (rice, wheat, and maize) at
   provincial level in mainland China over 2000-2017. Results indicate that
   water resilience related to crop production of China as a whole was at
   the lower-middle level over the study period. The green water resilience
   had higher initial performance, while the blue water resilience had a
   faster growth rate (>50\%). The performance of adaptive and
   transformative capacity was 8.9 similar to 153.7\% better than
   resistance and absorptive capacity. There were significant
   heterogeneities in the water resilience score among crops and in time
   and space. Wheat had the highest resilience of green water, while its
   blue water resilience was the lowest among the three crops. The water
   resilience for crop production varied by up to 2.4-fold across
   provinces. Synergies and trade-offs among the four dimensions of water
   resilience were further evaluated. The current study provides an
   effective approach for assessing the state and progress of resilience of
   regional water resources for crop production.},

Title = {Farmers' Perception of Water Quality and Risks in the Mashavera River
   Basin, Georgia: Analyzing the Vulnerability of the Social-Ecological
   System through Community Perceptions},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {10},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Competing natural resources usage that leads to dramatic land use
   changes can threaten the balance of a social-ecological system. When
   this is the case, communities are directly exposed to the negative
   consequences of those land use changes. The Mashavera River Basin is
   considered one of the hotspots of environmental pollution in Georgia.
   This is of importance for public health because the food production from
   this basin meets a substantial proportion of the country's food demand.
   The farmers' perception of the water quality and their perceived risks
   to the economy, health, and lifestyle reflect the status of the
   environmental and social conditions. The inclusion of farmers' risk
   perceptions is an important stage of water quality governance that could
   enable active civic participation. The approach of this research study
   was the convergence model in the triangular design of the mixed method
   approach. As part of the social data, the research study was conducted
   with a survey of 177 households, for which agriculture was either a main
   or partial source of income. A few focus group discussions were also
   conducted. A binary logistic regression analysis was employed as the
   main method for the analysis. The results from the pollution load index
   (PLI) were used as the supportive data to verify some geospatial
   hypotheses. We found that aesthetic attributes (i.e., color changes
   observed in the river) and the source of the water contamination (i.e.,
   mining sites) were the main predictor variables for a perceived risk to
   water quality, health, and livelihoods. The people who work in
   agriculture as the main income source had more concern about their
   ability to sell their agricultural products as a result of water
   contamination in the river, compared with people for whom agriculture is
   a secondary source of income or for self-consumption. Age, amount of
   land, years of agricultural experience, and the source of water supply
   for agriculture did not have a significant effect on any of the risk
   perception or water quality perception models. The results indicate that
   the health risk is perceived more strongly in areas with more heavily
   contaminated water compared to less polluted areas. We propose that
   conducting a public risk perception assessment is an ideal means to
   detect people's concerns regarding water quality governance for future
   risk analysis in Georgia. Another recommendation of this study is an
   integrated model of risk assessment that combines the results from a
   public risk perception assessment and a technical assessment. The
   benefits of such an integrated assessment include finding new
   hazard-sensitive areas for further analysis, the possibility to
   cross-check data for verification, communal communication of hazardous
   conditions by utilizing local knowledge, and the direct participation of
   the community in monitoring risks.},

Title = {Unbalanced social-ecological development within the Dongting Lake basin:
   Inspiration from evaluation of ecological restoration projects},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {315},
Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {The targets of ecosystem restoration have gradually transformed from a
   narrow focus on single or a few ecosystem services to a compound mode
   focusing on ecological, social and economic benefits. The
   socialecological system provides an integrative perspective to promote
   this transformation by reestablishing the relation between human and
   natural systems. Over the past 30 years, several ecological restoration
   projects have been implemented in the Dongting Lake basin to reverse
   ecological deterioration and improve agricultural production. This paper
   investigates the spatio-temporal dynamics of social-ecological changes
   in the Dongting Lake basin based on land use/cover and NDVI change
   trends. Results showed that the large-scale ecological restoration
   projects did not evidently increase the area of forest and grass in the
   basin, however, NDVI showed a significant growth trend. The
   social-ecological changes and its relevance to ecological restoration
   were also identified. From 2000 to 2015, water retention had the largest
   increment (95.70\%), followed by soil conservation (25.90\%), whereas
   carbon sequestration decreased slightly (-1.49\%). At the same time, the
   economy and agriculture in the basin also developed. Although the
   ecological restoration projects had promoted the overall socio-economic
   development and ecosystem restoration in Dongting Lake basin, their
   distribution and influence were disequilibrium within the basin. It
   seemed difficult for most counties to achieve rapid socio-economic
   development and improve ecosystem services at the same time. The benefit
   evaluation of ecological restoration projects based on social-ecological
   system can help to build on and reinforce existing restoration
   initiatives, and promote the sharing of experiences and good practices
   in ecosystem conservation and restoration practices.},

Title = {Exploring spatial-temporal driving factors for changes in multiple
   ecosystem services and their relationships in West Liao River Basin,
   China},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {904},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {Ecosystem services (ES) are the direct and indirect benefits people
   obtain from ecosystems, serving as a bridge linking ecological systems
   and social-economic systems. The quantitative assessment of the dynamic
   changes in ES and their relationships and the identification of the
   driving forces behind them have recently become a research hotspot.
   However, several research gaps remain challenging, such as the lack of
   an analytical framework for selecting relevant driving factors and the
   need for an innovative approach that integrally estimates the impacts of
   driving factors on the changes in ES and the relationships between ES.
   In this study, we modify the social-ecological system framework as the
   analytical basis and suggest a series of principles for selecting
   relevant driving factors, we then adopt the path analysis model to
   simultaneously and consistently quantify the contributions of driving
   factors to ES changes and their relationships. Using the West Liao River
   Basin (WLRB) as a case study, the results show the spatial-temporal
   variations in three ES and six driving factors from 2000 to 2020,
   divided into four periods. The estimation of path analysis model confirm
   two hypotheses that different driving factors exerted differential
   effects on changes in multiple ES in four periods for the whole WLRB and
   in three subbasins for the period 2015-2020. In addition, the path
   analysis exhibits the quantitative relationships between food
   production, water yield, and soil conservation, which vary temporally
   and spatially in different periods and different sub-basins. The
   identification of driving factors is helpful for supporting
   policy-making to construct a coupled self-adjusted social-ecological for
   the benefit of the public.},

Title = {Valuing beaches for beauty and recreation only? Uncovering perception
   bias through a hashtag analysis},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {155},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Sandy beaches are ecosystems that hold great economic value at local,
   national, and international level. How-ever, their perception as
   social-ecological systems is often limited by users and managers to the
   recreational asset, and their perception of ``beauty{''}. Such a
   perception bias can hamper conservation management, negatively impact
   the biodiversity on sandy beaches and even threaten the ecosystem
   services they provide. To survey this perception bias, we applied the
   method of netnography to analyse Instagram posts with the hashtag
   \#sandy -beach, extracting perceptions and values for nature (intrinsic,
   instrumental, and relational) towards sandy beaches and their ecological
   features. We used the concept of littoral active zone (LAZ) to define
   the boundaries of this social-ecological system that spans the land and
   the sea. Our results show that Instagram users focus on their social
   media mainly on the recreational values of sandy beaches and prioritise
   ecological features fitting into an imaginary of a ``pristine{''} beach,
   characterised by white sand and clear water - therewith supporting the
   hypothesis about a perception bias on sandy beaches. We identified a
   diverse set of relational values, especially around recreation and
   aesthetics, with a very marginal number of posts mentioning intrinsic or
   instrumental values. A recurring activity on LAZ was surfing, which
   emphasises the LAZ (wave break point, surf zone). To conserve the
   biodiversity and ecosystem services of sandy beaches, we see it as
   necessary to move away from a biased and narrow perception to one that,
   based on the LAZ as a system, is capable of including a diversity of
   biogeographical and ecological features, and the natural processes that
   maintain them.},

Title = {Assessing the historical adaptive cycles of an urban social-ecological
   system and its potential future resilience: the case of Xochimilco,
   Mexico City},
Journal = {REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {20},

Month = {FEB 4},
Abstract = {As the bulk of the world's population becomes urban, maintaining urban
   ecosystem services for environmental and social well-being in cities is
   crucial. According to resilience theory, maintaining such services
   requires for a complex adaptive systems perspective that helps in
   identifying key elements and dynamics behind cross-scale
   social-ecological interactions. In this context, the objective of this
   article is to use a resilience ``lens{''} to problematize the imminent
   loss of an urban wetland using the adaptive cycle model as a heuristic
   tool. Our case study focuses on the Xochimilco wetland, located in the
   southern periphery of Mexico City. Xochimilco is characterized by the
   presence of a complex system of raised bed wetland agriculture (the
   chinampa system), which was established over 1000 years ago; currently,
   despite having a recognized cultural and environmental value, it is
   threatened by increasing urban sprawl, over-exploitation of the aquifer,
   and water contamination. By conducting a historical analysis of the
   Xochimilco social-ecological system, we assess how it has gone through
   phases of the adaptive cycle. As a result, we identify critical elements
   of the system's historically maintained resilience and main drivers of
   system change. From such findings, we present some insights on the
   possibilities of maintaining the system's resilience and guidance for
   future management strategies for the Xochimilco wetland. Lastly, we
   reflect on the scope and limitations of using a resilience-based
   approach and an adaptive cycle analysis for addressing urban
   sustainability problems, especially in cities in the Global South.},

Title = {Groundwater as a social-ecological system: A framework for managing

Journal = {GROUNDWATER FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {8},
Pages = {579-589},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Groundwater in Pacific Small Island Developing States is a critical
   source of freshwater for island ecosystems and human communities.
   Groundwater systems face challenges from growing populations, climate
   change and climate variability. Many groundwater systems in the region
   have been inappropriately managed, with increasing occurrences of
   groundwater pollution and saltwater intrusion. This limits the
   availability of freshwater, increases the likelihood of contracting
   water borne diseases, and the cost of access to alternative freshwater
   sources. In this paper, we argue that groundwater systems are
   social-ecological systems, where anthropogenic activities and
   groundwater conditions are linked through dynamic, non-linear processes.
   We also argue that groundwater management failures in the region, are
   associated with traditional command and control approaches to
   management, which ignore the systemic nature of coupled social and
   ecological groundwater systems; and assumes that groundwater resources,
   and the dependant human communities can be managed independently.
   Recognising the linkages and feedbacks between groundwater and dependant
   social communities is important for the long-term sustainability of
   groundwater in these regions. Conceptual frameworks are useful tools to
   order phenomena and material, revealing patterns and processes, and
   enabling the joining of multiple areas of understanding into a single
   conceptual-empirical structure. We propose a framework to manage
   groundwater as a social-ecological system. The framework is comprised of
   three building blocks: complex adaptive systems, resilience thinking and
   strategic adaptive management. We discuss how the application of the
   framework in the Republic of Nauru may alter decades of groundwater
   mismanagement and steer the resource towards a sustainable path.},

   Urbanization Processes in East China},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {8},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {This article presents a social-ecological resilience assessment and
   attempts to explicitly examine the impacts of urbanization on
   resilience, with a view to explore how to strengthen social-ecological
   governance of the resilience of urban ecosystems. We use a combined
   Grey-Fuzzy evaluation model to discuss a case study of the Su-Xi-Chang
   city cluster, a metropolitan area in East China, in which total
   social-ecological resilience scores generally exhibited an upward trend,
   from 0.548 in 2001 to 0.760 in 2013. In the same period, resilience
   increased in relation to deterioration of environmental quality,
   pollution discharge, and landscape and ecological governance change, but
   decreased in relation to social-economic development. Besides, different
   contributions of indicators to their related resilience values reveal
   the heterogeneity of the resilience in terms of various disturbances. In
   addition, several scenarios are posited in an attempt to detect the
   relationship between social-ecological resilience and urbanization with
   the goal of improving urban governance. The results suggested that rapid
   urbanization under rigid and vertically organized forms of governance
   would cause the social-ecological system to lose resilience, or even to
   bring it near collapse. When the growth rate of urban land expansion
   reaches 16\%, disturbances caused by urbanization would push the
   social-ecological system over a particular threshold, where the way it
   functions changes. However, it is found that adaptive and collaborative
   governance, incorporating increases in both public participation and the
   efficiency of environment administration, would strengthen
   social-ecological governance of resilience to provide the urban system
   with a wide operating space, and even with accelerated urbanization
   ratios.},

Abstract = {Coastal zones are critical elements in the Earth system as a whole. They
   provide a majority of global ecosystem goods and services and are
   central to socio-cultural and economic development. Demographic pressure
   on coastal lands and sea resources is increasing and so are pressures
   attributable to global change and globalization. Managing coastal
   systems needs a joined-up holistic system understanding and
   acknowledging the multiple spatial, temporal, and institutional scales
   involved. Ultimately, it is all about managing people along a water
   continuum that may reach from far upstream down to continental shelf
   margins. We provide an overview of this volume featuring outstanding
   cases of coastal management and regions up to continental scale showing
   rapid coastal change as well as some insight into new scientific
   concepts to inform sustainable development in coasts.},

Abstract = {In the era of the Anthropocene, understanding the dynamic interactions
   between humans and water is crucial for supporting both human well-being
   and the sustainable management of resources. The current water
   management challenges are inherently unpredictable and difficult to
   control. Social-ecological systems (SESs) approaches explicitly
   recognize the connections and feedbacks between human and natural
   systems. For addressing the complex challenges of the Anthropocene,
   consideration of SES attributes such as causality (or interdependence),
   feedback, non-linearity, heterogeneity, and cross-scale dynamics is
   important. In addition, innovative qualitative and quantitative methods
   such as Bayesian networks, agent-based modelling, system dynamics,
   network analysis, multicriteria analysis, integrated assessment and
   role-play games have recently been used in SES research. The overall
   goal of this review is to gauge the extent to which SES attributes and
   methods are considered within the current interdisciplinary water
   paradigm. The paper therefore develops the normative theoretical
   characteristics of SES in terms of its key attributes (i.e. causality,
   feedback, heterogeneity, nonlinearity, and cross-scale dynamics)
   incorporated in the water paradigm approaches. The paper then compares
   the methods applied in the interdisciplinary water paradigm and examines
   how they can complement each other. Finally, the paper reflects back on
   the usefulness of SES attributes and methods for assessing the
   interdisciplinary water paradigm and makes recommendations for future
   research.},

Title = {A multi-decadal and social-ecological systems analysis of community
   waterpoint payment behaviours in rural Kenya},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {47},
Number = {A},
Pages = {85-96},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Community-based financing of rural water supply operation and
   maintenance is a well-established policy principle in sub-Saharan
   Africa. Yet evidence from over 90,000 waterpoints in five sub-Saharan
   African countries suggests a majority of communities fail to establish
   and sustain a revenue collection system. As a result, insufficient
   finances to repair waterpoints can lead to lengthy downtimes or
   abandonment, threatening the health and welfare of millions of water
   users forced to revert to unsafe or distant alternatives. Applying a
   social-ecological systems framework to community waterpoints in rural
   Kenya, we empirically assess the prevalence and determinants of
   financial contributions among water users. The analysis draws on
   multi-decadal data covering 229 years' worth of water committee
   financial records consisting of more than 53,000 household payments.
   Results reveal that non-payment and late payment are prevalent, and
   payment behaviours are predicted by groundwater quality, waterpoint
   location, productive water use, and rainfall season. The findings
   reflect the socio-ecological nature of waterpoint sustainability in
   rural sub-Saharan Africa and confirm that households are not always
   willing and able to pay for an improved water supply. This situation is
   symptomatic of a fundamental operation and maintenance financing
   challenge that must be addressed if the Sustainable Development Goal of
   universal access to safe water is to be achieved. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {Do ecosystem insecurity and social vulnerability lead to failure of
   water security?},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {38},
Number = {SI},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Achieving water security for humans and ecosystems is a pervasive
   challenge globally. Extensive areas of the Americas are at significant
   risk of water insecurity, resulting from global-change processes coupled
   with regional and local impacts. Drought, flooding, and water quality
   challenges pose significant threats, while at the same time, rapid urban
   expansion, competing water demands, river modifications, and expanding
   global markets for water-intensive agricultural products drive water
   insecurity. This paper takes a social-ecological systems perspective,
   aiming to identify examples and pathways towards resilient ecosystems
   and social development. It draws on lessons from two science-policy
   network projects, one focusing on water scarcity in arid and semi-arid
   regions of Argentina, Chile, Brazil, Peru, Mexico and the United States;
   and the second addressing river and lake basins as sentinels of climate
   variability and human effects on water quantity and quality in Canada,
   the United States, Argentina, Colombia, Uruguay and Chile. Together,
   these `complementary contrasts' provide an analytical basis to
   empirically examine stakeholder engagement, knowledge co-production and
   science-policy interaction supporting decision-making to achieve water
   security. The paper identifies four tenets for decision-making based on
   water-security-focused global-change science in the Americas: 1)
   Decision makers should focus on protecting ecosystems because water
   security (along with food and energy security) depend on them; 2)
   Water-use and allocation decisions ought to be made considering future
   environmental and societal vulnerabilities, especially climate
   projections; 3) Holistic approaches (at basin or other appropriate
   levels) are best suited to ensure social-ecological system resilience
   and reduce vulnerability; and 4) It is essential to support
   local/traditional livelihoods, and underserved populations to achieve
   equitable water security and ecosystem resilience.},

Abstract = {In this study, we examined the extent to which global warming management
   is currently integrated into the European Water Framework Directive
   (WFD), the central legal framework for water management in the EU. We
   focused on the Elbe River Basin District and how global warming is
   addressed in its water management. We used the social-ecological systems
   (SES) approach as our theoretical framework, representing an eminent
   analytical frame of biosphere-based sustainability science. In our
   study, we analysed core characteristics of SES in the context of global
   warming to evaluate the effectiveness of current water management in the
   Elbe River basin concerning long-term changing climate conditions. To
   determine to what extent each SES feature is considered in the Elbe
   water management, we applied a scale of 1 to 5. Our results show that
   the SES feature ``scale and openness{''} is best addressed (score 4.0)
   by the Elbe River basin management, followed by ``context dependency{''}
   (score 3.9); however, ``non-linearity, uncertainty, unpredictability{''}
   (score 3.2), ``self-organisation and adaptability{''} (score 3.1), and
   ``dynamics{''} (score 3.0) have only moderate impacts. SES features can
   only be considered comprehensively if global warming is accounted for in
   an integrated way at a European level. In order to ensure effective
   implementation, explicit regulations and legally binding obligations are
   most likely required.},

Abstract = {In arid environments, water is a highly unpredictable natural resource.
   Land use must be adapted to the availability of water for plant growth
   and as drinking water. In the oases along the river Draa, the
   variability of available water is partly buffered by natural storage and
   by human management. The vast areas outside the oases are used as
   rangelands. Here, water resources can only be managed indirectly,
   through the management of the vegetation and natural resources, firewood
   and forage. To understand the effects of direct and indirect water
   resource management on the social-ecological system's functioning, local
   land use strategies must be analyzed. In the past, research has
   concentrated on the management of water resource scarcity because this
   is an obvious problem of natural resource management in arid regions. In
   this section, we apply a broadened approach and analyze the relevant
   factors on an annual and inter-annual scale. We identify key traits of
   pastoral land management in the High Atlas region that mitigate the
   negative effects of extreme weather events (droughts and floods) and
   slow down land degradation. Our results show that local land use
   mitigates drought effects through a preventive natural resource
   management, particularly in times of abundant rainfall; it maintains or
   increases the capacity of the rangeland vegetation to buffer against
   rainfall variability.},

Title = {The optimal allocation and the evaluation of water resources carrying
   capacity in Shendong mining area},
Journal = {RESOURCES POLICY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {77},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Coal mining has consumed a large amount of water resources in China, and
   the entire industrial chain of coal production has a larger consumption
   of water resources than the past especially in Shendong mining area. The
   water resources carrying capacity determines the scale of coal industry
   development. The previous research had been conducted at the national,
   provincial and municipal levels, but there were few studies on the water
   resources carrying capacity of coal mining areas. The Shendong mining
   area is located in the coal-rich and waterscarce western region, where
   precipitation is low and evaporation is high. As a water-scarce area,
   the development of Shendong mining area is inseparable from the support
   of coal resources and the rational use of water resources. Therefore,
   firstly, taking the Shendong mining area as the research object, this
   paper set high, medium and low scenarios according to the development
   goals of Shendong mining area, Shenhua Group and the plans of China. The
   gray forecast model was used to predict the water demand of the
   economic-social-ecological system of the mining area from 2020 to 2030
   under different scenarios. Secondly, a multi-objective optimization
   model was established with the objective function to optimize the water
   resources allocation in Shendong mining area. Thirdly, based on the
   forecast and optimization results, a water resources carrying capacity
   evaluation model was constructed to evaluate the water resources
   carrying capacity of the Shendong mining area. Finally, based on the
   results, the suggestions for rational development and the utilization of
   water resources in the Shendong mining area were proposed.},

Title = {Sustaining the Commons: The Coercive to Cooperative, Resilient, and
   Adaptive Nature of State Comprehensive Water Planning Legislation},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN PLANNING ASSOCIATION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {82},
Number = {4},
Pages = {327-349},
Month = {FAL},
Abstract = {Problem, research strategy, and findings: States need guidance to adopt
   comprehensive water planning legislation that can affect urban planning
   and built form. Current state legislation, however, may not yet
   incorporate emerging water resource paradigms that promote sustainable
   water management at the state and substate levels. Planners can improve
   existing state legislation, but need guidance on incorporating the
   latest thinking on resilience, adaptive capacity, and sustainable
   commons management. I identify the 26 states with comprehensive water
   planning legislation, and analyze that legislation using a new
   assessment tool that builds on the coercive versus cooperative metric
   (CvCA). I determine where each state's water planning legislation falls
   on a coercive versus cooperative spectrum, and the extent to which each
   state's legislation incorporates sustainable commons management (SCM)
   and social-ecological resilience (SER) mechanisms and attributes. Most
   of the 26 states with comprehensive water planning legislation balance
   coercive and cooperative approaches to achieve state and substate water
   plans, although research suggests that planning is most effective when
   legislation is more cooperative. Moreover, most have not codified SCM
   and SER mechanisms into state water planning legislation, suggesting
   that the plans that follow may lack the adaptive capacity to increase
   the resilience of the water system. Research limitations include the
   single data source and potential interpretive coding bias.Takeaway for
   practice: Planners can advocate for new or improved state water
   legislation that incorporates integral adaptive and resiliency concepts,
   encouraging states to include the fundamental features of the
   social-ecological system that lead to better water management.},

Volume = {18},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {In groundwater management as a common pool, the participation of the
   beneficiaries faces the problem of free riding. Therefore, it is
   necessary to provide a framework that can minimize the water public
   tragedy and free riding. This article used studies from around the world
   to develop a governance framework for the socio-ecological and
   resilience system and express the function of element resilience within
   this system in protecting groundwater public and private rights. The
   elements of water management were divided into the three subsystems of
   the aquifer, the natural environment, and the community above the
   aquifer, and explained how the elements sustain water services through
   interacting with each other. Also determined how resilience
   characteristics of elements against control variables groundwater,
   challenge public and private rights and cause controversy. The
   discussions showed that the elements and resilience of the elements can
   be different and contradictory to each other and challenge the public
   and private rights of groundwater, which can be very effective in
   building trust and stakeholder participation in water management. The
   SES framework is used in planning and policy-making and determining
   public and private rights, strengthening the resilience of the system,
   and assessing the dynamics of the groundwater system.},

Abstract = {Aquaculture, and shrimp aquaculture in particular, can have major social
   and environmental impacts. However, aquaculture remains an understudied
   area in commons research. Can aspects of commons theory be applied to
   solve problems of aquaculture? We examined three coastal community-based
   shrimp aquaculture operations in northwestern Sri Lanka using a case
   study approach. These shrimp farms were individually owned by small
   producers and managed under local-level rules designed by cooperatives
   (samithi). The common-pool resource of major interest was water for
   aquaculture ponds, obtained from an interconnected water body. We
   evaluated the shrimp farming social-ecological system by using Ostrom's
   design principles for collective action. Key elements of the system
   were: clearly defined boundaries; collaboratively designed crop
   calendar, bottom-up approach involving community associations,
   multi-level governance, and farmers-and-government collaborative
   structures. Together, these elements resolved the excludability and
   subtractability problems of commons by establishing boundary and
   membership rules and collective choice rules.},

Title = {Exploring relationships among stream health, human well-being, and

Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {121},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Quantification of empirical relationships between ecosystem health and
   human well-being is uncommon at broad spatial scales. We used public
   data for Virginia (USA) counties to examine pairwise correlations among
   two indicators of stream health, thirteen indicators of human
   well-being, and four demographic metrics. Our indicators of stream
   health included the Virginia Stream Condition Index (VSCI) and the
   percentage of stream kilometers with a fish consumption advisory
   (\%FCA); these measures are inversely related. VSCI and \%FCA were
   correlated with some indicators of human health, safety and security,
   and living standards, as well as with some demographic metrics. VSCI was
   most strongly correlated (positively) with the percentage of a county's
   population self-identifying as White; \%FCA was most strongly correlated
   (positively) with overall mortality rate (number of deaths per 100,000
   people). This exploratory study highlights the need for future
   multidisciplinary, multiscale studies to characterize toxicological,
   epidemiological, socioeconomic, and political linkages including causal
   mechanisms - between ecosystem health and human well-being.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {332},
Month = {APR 15},
Abstract = {The land is a vital resource to support economic growth. Previous
   studies have mainly taken urban and agri-cultural areas as the major
   factors of economic boost. However, the supporting role of diversified
   land in sus-tainable economy has not been fully valued. This study
   analyzed the relationship between land cover diversity and socioeconomic
   outputs from 1992 to 2019 on up to 2086 counties in China. The results
   showed the regional disparity in the eastern and western counties. In
   the western counties, land cover diversity was positively correlated
   with per area socioeconomic indicators throughout the period. In the
   eastern counties, the correlation with per area indicators has gradually
   changed from negative to positive. The correlation with per capita
   in-dicators was more significant in the east than west. The regional
   disparity and temporal trends may come from the influence of water
   resources, demographic pressure and other constraints in different
   regions. The refreshed land value can help to achieve sustainable
   development and improve human well-being in the long term.},

Title = {Farmer identities and responses to the social-biophysical environment},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {39},
Pages = {145-155},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Row crop production in the United States (US) Midwest is responsible for
   a myriad of water pollution issues in the Mississippi River Basin and
   the Gulf of Mexico. US federal and state governments have spent billions
   of dollars since the 1930's to understand and develop biological and
   geophysical practices that will reduce the negative impacts of
   agriculture on these landscapes and water bodies. However, significantly
   fewer resources have been applied to understanding the human factor
   within this social-ecological system. Recently the social psychological
   framework known as farmer identity as been used to better understand how
   farmers view themselves as they perform their role as farmer. To
   empirically test this concept in the US state of Iowa, a farmer identity
   question was developed and data were collected as part of an annual
   survey of Iowa farmers. Four farmer identities (Productivist,
   Conservationist, Civic-minded, and Naturalist) are identified using
   principal components analysis and tested for their ability to predict
   support for farm policy scenarios related to soil and water resource
   protection. Results show that Productivist, Conservationist, and
   Naturalist identities were likely to be activated by soil and water
   policies; and the Civic-minded identity was not activated by soil and
   water policies in general but was significantly against more money for
   conservation because it might mean more regulation. (C) 2015 The

Abstract = {Managing trade-offs among water uses in a river basin to sustain
   multiple ecosystem services is crucial for adaptation to changing river
   flow regimes. Here we analyze the trade-off between irrigation and
   fisheries in the Amudarya, a semi-arid river basin in Central Asia,
   using an optimal control and an agent-based modeling approach. With the
   optimal control approach (OCA), we identify the economic and ecological
   conditions for water sharing in a regime where a social manager controls
   water withdrawals and fish harvesting. With the agent-based model (ABM),
   we relax some of the assumptions of the OCA to investigate how
   localized, individual agents with varied water use histories adapt their
   water use activities to local resource conditions. Variation in the
   farmers' initial labor allocations to the two activities results in
   regimes with only one activity or both. Global returns and income
   equality are highest in a mixed regime. The mixed regimes also are more
   robust to water variability because fishing activities can compensate
   for decreased agricultural performance in the midstream regions. Thus,
   allowing for multiple uses can improve the coupled social-ecological
   system's performance and its resilience. We also observe a lock-in
   effect similar to the current situation in the Amudarya, where
   agriculture is the dominant water use and transition to a more balanced
   allocation has proven to be extremely difficult. As in the ABM, this can
   to some extent be attributed to the difficulties of achieving sufficient
   revenues from fishing when agricultural activities upstream are high.
   Regulations or incentives are needed to overcome those barriers, and to
   facilitate progress towards integrated water management.},

Abstract = {This article proposes a conceptual framework for understanding the
   resilience of water security at the scale of a river basin, thereby
   contributing to the ongoing scholarship on water security. Based on
   literature review, we apply systems thinking and resilience theories to
   encapsulate water security in a river basin as a system whose behaviour
   depends on the interaction of the component parts and the environment
   within which it occurs. The proposed framework has been built on the
   tenet that the resilience of any system such as that for water security
   depends on the interactions (the relationships) of the components of the
   particular system. We have thus argued that there is a relationship
   between resilience and the configurations of the system of water
   security. By exploring the Orange-Senqu River Basin, we suggest that
   configurations of the system of water security that includes the
   interaction of actors within the river basin, the structure of
   institutions (including institutional regimes), governance mechanisms,
   the capacity of actors and so forth generate the changes in the
   behaviour of the system. This behaviour might enable the system of water
   security to move into a different regime. Depending on the nature of the
   regime, the system can be considered to be resilient or nonresilient to
   disturbances. Any attempt to better understand this system requires us
   to uncover the configurations of this system and how its parts interact
   with each other, and this is, therefore, the pathway to unlocking the
   potential of achieving water security at the scale of a river basin.},

Title = {Is it because of climate change? Social-ecological system analysis of
   wetland protected area in Vietnamese Mekong Delta},
Journal = {WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {32},
Number = {1},
Pages = {33-57},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Wetland protected areas (WPA) are among the most productive natural
   environments, providing substantial socio-economic benefits to humans as
   well as habitats for numerous species. However, they are also highly
   vulnerable in the Anthropocene era due to various factors, such as
   population growth, unsustainable production, and climate change.
   Assessing the land cover change of WPA and its driving forces is
   necessary work for the sustainable development and management of WPA.
   Here, we investigated vegetation as an indicator for land cover changes
   in WPA because of its strong interaction with the governance system and
   external related ecosystems of WPA, such as water resources and nutrient
   cycles. Along with the change in vegetation, we examined how climate
   change contributes to WPA change and human management. With the
   complexity of the research tasks, a social-ecological system (SES)
   approach was applied with three main elements: the resource system
   (vegetation covers), external related ecosystems (climate change), and
   governance system (wetland management) and their interactions through
   ecological performance (outcome). We contribute to the lack of temporary
   SES research in the coverage of External Related Ecosystems in relation
   to Resource systems and Governance systems. The selected site is the
   first Ramsar site of Vietnam's Mekong Delta-Tram Chim National Park
   (TCNP), which is located at the exit of the Mekong River flowing into
   Vietnam's territory. The study used a mixed methodology with the
   Mann-Kendall rank test, Theil-Sen estimative method, and the
   Mann-Whitney-Pettit method to analyze trends in climate parameters from
   1978 to 2019. Additionally, the wetland vegetation changes were detected
   through the analysis of satellite images based on the Normalized
   Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from 2002 to 2020. We also used
   Public Participation Geographic Information Systems (PPGIS) and carried
   out a desk review of local reports and previous research for the local
   disaster timeline and governance system. The results show that the
   climate in TCNP has significantly changed, with an increase in both
   temperature and rainfall during the dry season. However, a decrease in
   NDVI dynamics and an extension of the lowland vegetation community
   dominate the trends of spatio-temporal change in vegetation. With the
   SES approach, we indicated that climate change is not the main driver
   but is always perceived as an increased risk for biodiversity
   conservation of WPA. Consequently, maladaptive actions and regulations
   from the governance system have been implemented, which can threaten the
   sustainable development of WPA. Therefore, this study contributes to a
   more comprehensive viewpoint on the conservation and adaptive management
   of WPA.},

Title = {Adaptation and Resilience in Pastoral Management of the Mediterranean
   Bedouin Social-Ecological System in the Northwestern Coastal Zone of
   Egypt},
Booktitle = {BUILDING RESILIENCE OF HUMAN-NATURAL SYSTEMS OF PASTORALISM IN THE
   DEVELOPING WORLD: INTERDISCIPLINARY PERSPECTIVES},
Year = {2016},
Pages = {209-250},
Abstract = {On the basis of the results of the ELVULMED, MOUVE, and CLIMED research
   projects, this chapter presents a long-term analysis of the Bedouin
   society in the northwestern coastal zone (NWCZ) of Egypt, especially the
   resilience of the Bedouin social-ecological system facing global change.
   Located along the Mediterranean coast, the NWCZ is bordered by Libya to
   west, the hinterland of the Nile Valley to the east, and the
   northeastern Sahara to the south. Settled by Bedouin tribes, the NWCZ is
   a typical case study of the North African pastoral area. Global change
   in this arid region is characterized by frequent droughts and water
   scarcity, structural deficit in food security, strong demographic
   growth, rural exodus, new social demands, especially from the youth, and
   serious social challenges currently linked to the Arab Spring.
   The first part of this chapter presents some elements relevant to the
   history of the NWCZ, from the Roman period until the beginning of the
   twentieth century, to give a better understanding of the context of the
   establishment of the Bedouin society.
   Many of these elements are not specific to the NWCZ, and they concern
   the entire North African and western Asian region. The second part
   describes the major events that have occurred during the twentieth
   century in the NWCZ, with the objectives to better define the main
   phases of the Bedouin social-ecological system and to understand the
   drivers of long-term change and, consequently, define possible key
   factors for sustainable development in the face of the new context of
   global change, including rangeland recuperation and management. The
   third part considers the Bedouin strategies in the face of global
   change, especially the 15-year drought from 1995 to 2010, and the
   changes in the socioeconomic context linked to the building of
   infrastructures for water supply, tourism development, information and
   communication technologies, the new demands of the local society, mainly
   the youth, and more recently the Arab Spring. Maybe the main change is
   the weak role of the rangeland in the new Bedouin society. In the fourth
   part, three scenarios for the future are described and which have been
   drafted with the perceptions of different local stakeholders. The fifth
   and final part presents some concluding remarks, focused specifically on
   the future of the rangeland, its management, and the role of the Bedouin
   society, and more generally the future of the pastoral society in the
   new North African changing context.
   The results presented in this chapter come from data collected during
   three successive research projects conducted from 2011 to 2013. The
   first project was a survey based on a large questionnaire completed by
   180 breeders in six villages in the NWCZ. The questionnaire included
   data about the history and structure of the family, the tribe, the land,
   the crop and livestock farming system, the family and local networks,
   the perception of change, and the family's projects for the future, etc.
   The second project was a more detailed survey, based on the same
   questionnaire with 50 families in the Nagamish wadi located in the
   central part of the NWCZ, near the city of Marsa Matruh. This project
   used several tools from diverse disciplines, including crop and
   livestock farming systems, geography, economics, water management, and
   policy science. The third project involved a set of interviews with 25
   local stakeholders in the NWCZ focusing on the following topics: their
   mental models about livestock, their perceptions regarding diverse
   topics such as regional trends, the main drivers of change, past,
   current, and future functions of livestock on a local scale, their hopes
   and fears for the local society, current challenges and conflicts,
   especially those linked to drought, water supply, and rangeland
   management, and their scenarios for the future.},

Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {18},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {The Bear River is driven by a highly variable, snow-driven montane
   ecosystem and flows through a drought-prone arid region of the western
   United States. It traverses three states, is diverted to store water in
   an ecologically unique natural lake, Bear Lake, and empties into the
   Great Salt Lake at the Bear River Migratory Bird Refuge (BRMBR). People
   in the Bear River Basin have come to anticipate droughts, building a
   legal, institutional, and engineered infrastructure to adapt to the
   watershed's hydrologic realities and historical legacies. Their ways of
   understanding linked vulnerabilities has led to what might appear as
   paradoxical outcomes: farmers with the most legally secure water rights
   are the most vulnerable to severe drought; managers at the federal Bear
   River Migratory Bird Refuge engage in wetland farming and make unlikely
   political alliances; and, increased agricultural irrigation efficiency
   in the Bear River Basin actually threatens the water supply of some
   wetlands. The rationality of locality is the key to understanding how
   people in the Bear River Basin have increased their adaptive capacity to
   droughts by recognizing their interdependencies. As the effects of
   climate change unfold, understanding social-ecological system linkages
   will be important for guiding future adaptations and enhancing
   resilience in ways that appropriately integrate localized ecosystem
   capacity and human needs.},

Title = {Interactions between Climate Change and Infrastructure Projects in
   Changing Water Resources: An Ethnobiological Perspective from the
   Daasanach, Kenya},

Abstract = {The fast and widespread environmental changes that have intensified in
   the last decades are bringing disproportionate impacts to Indigenous
   Peoples and Local Communities. Changes that affect water resources are
   particularly relevant for subsistence-based peoples, many of whom
   already suffer from constraints regarding reliable access to safe water.
   Particularly in areas where water is scarce, climate change is expected
   to amplify existing stresses in water availability, which are also
   exacerbated by multiple socioeconomic drivers. In this paper, we look
   into the local perceptions of environmental change expressed by the
   Daasanach people of northern Kenya, where the impacts of climate change
   overlap with those brought by large infrastructure projects recently
   established in the Omo River. We show that the Daasanach have rich and
   detailed understanding of changes in their environment, especially in
   relation to water resources. Daasanach understand observations of change
   in different elements of the social-ecological system as an outcome of
   complex interactions between climatic and non-climatic drivers of
   change. Our findings highlight the perceived synergistic effects of
   climate change and infrastructure projects in water resources, driving
   multiple and cascading impacts on biophysical elements and local
   livelihoods. Our results also demonstrate the potential of Local
   Ecological Knowledge in enhancing the understanding of complex
   social-ecological issues, such as the impacts of environmental change in
   local communities. To minimize and mitigate the social-ecological
   impacts of development projects, it is essential to consider potential
   synergies between climatic and socioeconomic factors and to ensure
   inclusive governance rooted in local understandings of environmental
   change.},

Title = {Archetypical opportunities for water governance adaptation to climate
   change},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {25},
Number = {4},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {We explore opportunities for climate adaptation in the context of water
   governance. We focus on opportunities linked to the provision of climate
   information, raising the question of whether they are limited to
   incremental adaptation, or can also bring about transformational
   adaptation. We address this question through an archetype analysis based
   on 26 peer-reviewed articles. In each article, opportunities are
   identified, coded using the social-ecological system framework, and then
   bundled into archetypes that encompass similar opportunities reappearing
   across multiple cases. Results suggest that the provision of climate
   information can constitute an opportunity for adaptation that goes
   beyond purely incremental adjustments to a changing climate.
   Specifically, two of the six archetypes identified enable
   transformational adaptation by bringing long-term implications of
   current impacts into focus and by addressing the issue of capacity of
   existing institutions to respond to climate change. However, there is a
   high degree of heterogeneity in the characterization of opportunities,
   and the six archetypes only cover about one in three of the
   opportunities identified. This indicates the need for further research
   to develop more streamlined conceptualizations. In this respect, the
   archetypes identified herewith suggest some avenues for further
   conceptual development. We also explore policy implications, raising
   questions regarding the current development of climate services.},

Title = {A comprehensive sustainability appraisal of water governance in Phoenix,
   AZ},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {116},
Pages = {58-71},
Month = {FEB 15},
Abstract = {In Phoenix, Arizona and other metropolitan areas, water governance
   challenges include variable climate conditions, growing demands, and
   continued groundwater overdraft. Based on an actor-oriented examination
   of who does what with water and why, along with how people interact with
   hydro-ecological systems and man-made infrastructure, we present a
   sustainability appraisal of water governance for the Phoenix region.
   Broadly applicable to other areas, our systems approach to sustainable
   water governance overcomes prevailing limitations to research and
   management by: employing a comprehensive and integrative perspective on
   water systems; highlighting the activities, intentions, and rules that
   govern various actors, along with the values and goals driving
   decisions; and, establishing a holistic set of principles for social
   ecological system integrity and interconnectivity, resource efficiency
   and maintenance, livelihood sufficiency and opportunity, civility and
   democratic governance, intra- and inter-generational equity, and
   finally, precaution and adaptive capacity. This study also contributes
   to reforming and innovating governance regimes by illuminating how these
   principles are being met, or not, in the study area. What is most needed
   in metropolitan Phoenix is enhanced attention to ecosystem functions and
   resource maintenance as well as social equity and public engagement in
   water governance. Overall, key recommendations entail: addressing
   interconnections across hydrologic units and subsystems (e.g., land and
   water), increasing decentralized initiatives for multiple purposes
   (e.g., ecological and societal benefits of green infrastructure),
   incorporating justice goals into decisions (e.g., fair allocations and
   involvement), and building capacity through collaborations and social
   learning with diverse interests (e.g., scientists, policymakers, and the
   broader public). (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Role-playing simulations have gained in popularity in recent years as a
   novel method of engaging researchers and stakeholders in a variety of
   social and environmental issues. While academic interest has grown on
   this topic, knowledge remains sparse on the underlying theories that may

   concepts of social learning and procedural rhetoric. We describe and
   discuss the conceptual basis for our framework, giving a detailed
   account of its application through the recently developed the
   Water-Food-Energy Nexus Game (Nexus Game) as an example. We illustrate
   the process involved in designing the Nexus Game through initial
   scoping, prototyping, and design decisions, and how game structure and
   debriefing have been crafted to foster social learning focused on the
   understanding of the underlying social-ecological system as well as
   fostering collaboration between stakeholders. We also provide the
   analysis of qualitative data collected during recent gaming sessions
   across three continents to evaluate the Nexus Game's potential learning

Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {28},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Threats to water security are on the rise globally. In the Great Lakes,
   major threats arise from watershed land-use practices promoting chemical
   and nutrient pollution. In the Maumee River Watershed (MRW), which
   discharges into the western basin of Lake Erie, nutrient inputs
   associated with harmful algal bloom events (HABs) have increased in
   frequency and severity over the last several decades. This includes
   forcing the historic shut down of the City of Toledo's drinking water
   supply to 400,000 residents in 2014. Conditions which favor HABs did not
   appear overnight. We trace the history of land-use practices that
   transformed the structure and function of the MRW from a balanced system
   into a source of nutrient dynamics favoring HABs. Successful policy
   intervention must treat the MRW as a complex adaptive system operating
   at multiple scales at the intersection of agricultural practices and
   conflicting socioeconomic drivers, confounding traditional interventions
   that focus on single factors such as water quality or fertilizer use
   regulation. We conclude with three interventions that policymakers can
   employ to help tip the scales back into an ecologically balanced system.},

   2030 SDGs},
Journal = {HUMANITIES \& SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 3},
Abstract = {The cryosphere plays a critical role in maintaining the stability of the
   social-ecological system, but rapid cryosphere changes have been and are
   wide-ranging and have a profound affect, even threatening the
   achievement of the UN's 2030 sustainable development goals (SDGs). In
   the study, we review the opportunities and threats caused by cryosphere
   changes in achieving the SDGs. The results reveal that cryosphere
   changes are significantly related to the supply of sustainable fresh
   water (SDG 6), alpine hydropower (SDG 7), and climate action (SDG 13).
   In addition, they favorably support life on land and below water (SDG
   14-15), and effectively affect the livelihoods (SDG 1-5), agricultural
   development (SDG 2), snow/ice tourism (SDG 8), infrastructure (SDG 9),
   regional inequality (SDG 10), and cities and communities (SDG 11), as
   well as affecting Arctic shipping routes (SDG 16). Long-term cryosphere
   threats far outweigh their contributions to the SDGs. The cryosphere
   contributes little to human emissions, but it is significantly affected
   by climate change. Areas affected by cryosphere changes need to
   strengthen resilience and enhance the ability to adapt to the influences
   of cryosphere changes (SDG 1-17) via financial transfer, multilateral
   international cooperation, and other practical policies.},

Abstract = {This study investigates the historical development of the southwest
   coastal region of Bangladesh through the lens of human-delta
   co-evolutionary system. The change process of social and
   hydro-ecological systems is described based on the
   drivers-pressure-state-impact-response (DPSIR) framework. The multiple
   physical and socio-economic drivers such as climatic change, upstream
   development, geologic process, land use change-affected river flow,
   salinity, water logging and cyclones are creating adverse impacts on
   ecology (e.g. mangrove forest) and society (e.g. population migration).
   Existing management practices such as the Coastal Embankment project
   (CEP) also created adverse impacts on social-ecological system. In
   addition to the geology of this region that plays the major role in the
   delta development process, human interventions such as large coastal
   development projects have intervened the land formation processes. The
   trends and impacts of these changes along the coast unfold the necessity
   of integrated management approach such as Integrated Water Resources
   Management (IWRM) and Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM).
   Comprehensive understanding of social and hydro-ecological system in
   southwest coastal region through DPSIR approach presented in this study
   can provide effective solution for implementing ongoing management
   strategies.},

Title = {Institutional Performance of Collective Irrigation Systems: A Fuzzy Set
   Qualitative Comparative Analysis in the Nile Delta of Egypt},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {3},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Egypt, akin to many countries in the global South, has striven to
   promote collective management to overcome the challenges of irrigation
   management since the 1990s. Establishing shared pumping stations (SPSs)
   has been one of the cornerstones helping farmers better manage water for
   irrigation. Operating SPSs successfully poses collective action
   problems, for which there is no single set of solutions. This paper
   utilizes fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to identify
   which conditions or configurations are sufficient or necessary for
   well-operated SPSs. The study draws on empirical data gathered through
   semi-structured interviews from 45 cases, located in Kafr El-Sheikh
   Governorate in Egypt's Nile Delta. Results show that three different
   paths are sufficient to ensure well-operated SPSs. These are: (1) the
   condition of effective rules related to allocation, monitoring, and
   sanctions; (2) the configuration of small group size of SPSs and large
   irrigated sizes of SPSs; or (3) the configuration of adequate water
   supply and appropriate location of the SPS command area. The paper
   concludes that neither group size nor resource size alone explains the
   outcome of collective action, while a combination of both factors does.
   Similarly, an adequate water supply is essential to enhance users'
   engagement in collective actions only when resource location
   characteristics do not provide alternative water sources for irrigation.},

Title = {Short-term decisions in lake restoration have long-term consequences for
   water quality},
Journal = {REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {20},
Number = {3},
Month = {AUG 17},
Abstract = {Ecological regime shifts from clear to turbid water states in shallow
   temperate lakes are quite well-investigated phenomena but critical time
   lags from human interaction with the lake and restoration activities are
   much less understood. This is a complex challenge for institutions who
   manage lakes but are usually less familiar with non-linear dynamics,
   slow and fast influences on water quality and how to manage those from a
   social-ecological perspective. We extend a well-known minimal model of
   shallow lake regime shifts to enable simulations over time with short-
   and long-term management measures (nutrient reduction, trawling,
   planting of aquatic vegetation). While we explore the mathematical
   conditions for ecological bistability, we also identify the necessary
   and sufficient extent of measures to restore the clear water state.
   Restoration scenarios evaluated by trajectories in the state space
   demonstrate the increased effectiveness from combined measures even when
   considering countereffective activities such as pike fishing. But,
   single measures alone may delay or even miss the overall restoration
   target. Our analysis demonstrates the importance of understanding
   transient dynamics where stable state analyses alone remain elusive
   about alternative ways to interact with bistability. We conclude that
   successful management of bistable systems, and particularly shallow
   temperate lakes, needs careful balancing between short-term improvements
   and long-term influence on the systems state.},

Title = {A dynamic assessment of water scarcity risk in the Lower Brahmaputra
   River Basin: An integrated approach},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {48},
Pages = {120-131},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Many international river basins are likely to experience increasing
   water scarcity over the coming decades. This water scarcity is not
   rooted only in the limitation of resources, i.e. the shortage in the
   availability of freshwater relative to water demand, but also on social
   factors (e.g. flawed water planning and management approaches,
   institutional incapability to provide water services, unsustainable
   economic policies). Therefore, the assessment of water scarcity risks is
   not limited to the assessment of physical water supply and demand, but
   it requires also consideration of several socio-economic factors. In
   this study, we provide a comprehensive dynamic assessment of water
   scarcity risks for the Lower Brahmaputra river basin, a region where the
   hydrological impact of climate change is expected to be particularly
   strong and population pressure is high. The basin area of Brahmaputra
   River lies among four different countries: China, India, Bangladesh and
   Bhutan. For water scarcity assessment, we propose a novel integration of
   different approaches: (i) the assessment of water scarcity risk,
   considering complex social-ecological system; (ii) the analysis of
   dynamic behaviour of the system; (iii) exploration of participatory
   approach in which limited number of stakeholders identify the most
   relevant issues with reference to water scarcity risks and provide their
   preferences for the aggregation of risk assessment indicators. Results
   show that water scarcity risk is expected to slightly increase and to
   fluctuate remarkably as a function of the hazard signal. Social
   indicators show trends that can at least partially compensate the
   increasing trend of the drought index. The results of this study are
   intended to be used for contributing to planned adaptation of water
   resources systems, in Lower Brahmaputra River Basin. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Title = {Do adaptive policy adjustments deliver ecosystem-agriculture-economy
   co-benefits in land degradation neutrality efforts? Evidence from
   southeast coast of China},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {195},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Ecosystem restoration projects (ERPs) facilitate land degradation
   neutrality (LDN). However, the response dynamics and interactions of
   sectors within ecosystem-agriculture-economy nexus (EAEN) have not been
   sufficiently explored, which constrains the coordinated efficacy of LDN
   efforts. To bridge the knowledge gaps, the present study selected a land
   restoration hotspot in southeastern China as a case to investigate the
   simultaneous responses of the EAEN sectors to ERPs from a novel
   social-ecological system (SES)-based LDN perspective. Various
   biophysical models and Manne-Kendall trend test as well as multi-source
   spatially explicit data and socioeconomic statistics were applied to
   quantify the co-evolution of natural and socioeconomic indicators. ERPs
   converting cropland to woodland and grassland promoted vegetation
   restoration, reduced soil erosion, and enhanced carbon sequestration.
   However, cropland loss initially resulted in a decline in grain
   productivity. Policy adjustments and improvements in ecosystem
   restoration efforts and agricultural production conditions improved food
   security and increased agricultural production capacity. Effective
   policymaking and favorable resident engagement accelerated the
   transformation from a grain-production-based agriculture to diversified
   industries and, by extension, economic output, income, and population.
   The success of socioeconomic development under the SES framework for LDN
   demonstrated that this strategy could achieve the desired environmental,
   agricultural, and economic targets. EAEN under the SES conceptual
   framework provides an inclusive, comprehensive LDN perspective and
   improves ERP efficacy. The findings of the present work might be
   applicable to other land restoration areas challenged by the complex
   interactions among multidimensional factors. Comparably successful
   implementation of these ERPs could be realized if individual
   environmental and socioeconomic conditions are thoroughly considered
   during the formulation of coordinated development policies.},

Title = {The social-ecological system driving effective invasive plant
   management: two case studies of non-native <i>Phragmites</i>},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {267},
Month = {AUG 1},
Abstract = {Globally, the management of invasive plants is motivated by a desire to
   improve ecosystem services (e.g., recreation, flood mitigation, soil
   fertility for agriculture, aesthetics) and critical habitat for
   imperiled species. To reduce invader populations and impacts, it is
   important to document the social and ecological basis (i.e., the
   social-ecological system) for the management that has been employed and
   areas where a greater level of coordination among stakeholder groups
   (managers, scientists, legislators, resource users) could improve
   efforts. We present a conceptual model that builds on current thinking
   for how best to connect these four stakeholder groups-to foster stronger
   citizen lobbying for impacted resources, science-based governance,
   legislator-driven noxious weed laws and funding for management and
   science, knowledge co-production by scientists and managers, and
   co-management by managers and resource users. In light of our model, we
   present two case studies based in Nebraska and Utah, U.S.A. involving a
   common North American wetland invader, Phragmites australis (non-native
   common reed). In Nebraska, potential lawsuits stemming from water
   conveyance was strong motivation for funding management. In Utah, duck
   hunters and other resource users initially instigated management.
   Progress toward the successful management of Phragmites has been the
   result of manager-scientist partnerships addressing a knowing-doing gap
   among practitioners, the complexities of management mosaics, as well as
   overcoming economic and logistical constraints. Our model demonstrates
   how legislative initiatives can fund new research and bolster on-going
   management, while organically building strong partnerships among
   scientists, managers, and resource users that are key for successfully
   managing invasive species.},

Abstract = {Economic, policy, and climate changes have profoundly influenced
   pastoral social-ecological systems on the Tibetan Plateau. Climate
   change is believed to be leading to increasing extreme weather
   conditions such as snow disasters and droughts, putting a strain on the
   rangeland resources herders must have to increase income. Market-based
   economic reforms and interrelated development policies such as the
   Rangeland Household Contract Policy, the Ecological Construction
   Project, and herder settlement Initiatives have increased integration of
   pastoral regions into modern markets with promotion of tourism, expanded
   livestock markets, and marketing opportunities for rangeland resources.
   Although allocating common rangelands to households is the foundation of
   current rangeland management strategies to achieve these goals, it
   removes important technologies for coping with high variability in
   rangeland forage production from the traditional rangeland management
   portfolio on the Tibetan Plateau. These include shared risk, shared
   labor, seasonal and yearly herd mobility, and access to diverse areas of
   rangelands and multiple water sources. Field study of two villages in
   Guinan County of Qinghai Province, and Ruoergai County of Sichuan
   Province from 2011 to 2014 found that the villages responded to
   externally driven policy, economic, and climate changes with an
   innovative locally adapted quota-based grazing management system that
   preserves valuable management technologies, conserves rangeland
   resources, and provides individual opportunities for financial gain. In
   this way the village social-ecological system has exhibited considerable
   resiliency, maintaining a form of community governance that functions to
   manage the rangelands, improve well-being as indicated by livestock
   productivity, and, according to local perceptions, maintain rangeland
   condition. The community-based grazing quota system devised by the
   villages occupies a middle ground between common and individual models
   for resource use because it focuses more on how to equitably distribute
   services and utilities from rangelands, instead of how to distribute
   rangelands.},

Title = {Trajectory of a coastal social-ecological system: analyzing co-evolution
   and regime shifts in the Thau lagoon (Mediterranean Sea, France),
   1970-2018},
Journal = {REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {23},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {As coastal social-ecological systems (SES) are used for many different
   purposes and subject to different stressors, they are also among the
   most vulnerable and change the most rapidly. To achieve resilience,
   coastal areas require adaptive management based on integrated
   interdisciplinary approaches, requiring a deep understanding of SES
   dynamics, i.e. the ecological and social changes that comprise
   synchronicities and regime shifts. For the purpose of analyzing
   co-evolution and regime shifts, we propose an original and operational
   methodology combining (i) a chronosystemic timeline approach and (ii)
   time series analyses based on indicators from the
   ``Drivers-Pressures-State-Impacts-Responses{''} framework (14 indicators
   including population growth, eutrophication status, ecosystem services,
   management actions and climate change indicators). The methodology was
   tested on a SES located on the French Mediterranean coast, the Thau
   lagoon, whose trajectory we studied over a 5-decade period (1970-2018).
   Our results show that the dynamics of co-evolution and regime shifts of
   the SES were driven by a succession of interactions between sanitary or
   ecological crises and management adaptations. During the study period,
   this typical Mediterranean coastal SES appears to have evolved towards
   the multiplication of uses, improvement of water quality and more
   integrative management. Our methodology also highlighted three
   contrasting periods characterized by stable emerging properties and
   identified several cause-and-effect relationships, which is rare in
   historical analyses of SES. These cause-and-effect relationships concern
   major sanitary and ecological crises that have led to a reorganization
   of governance mechanisms and to technical remediation actions. Our
   approach based on long-term trajectories will help identify the
   conditions required for increasing the resilience of coastal SES and the
   best management objectives to face new challenges related to global
   climate change.},

Title = {Integrating the social, hydrological and ecological dimensions of
   freshwater health: The Freshwater Health Index},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {627},
Pages = {304-313},
Month = {JUN 15},
Abstract = {Degradation of freshwater ecosystems and the services they provide is a
   primary cause of increasing water insecurity, raising the need for
   integrated solutions to freshwater management. While methods for
   characterizing the multifaceted challenges of managing freshwater
   ecosystems abound, they tend to emphasize either social or ecological
   dimensions and fall short of being truly integrative. This paper
   suggests that management for sustainability of freshwater systems needs
   to consider the linkages between human water uses, freshwater ecosystems
   and governance. We present a conceptualization of freshwater resources
   as part of an integrated social-ecological system and propose a set of
   corresponding indicators to monitor freshwater ecosystem health and to
   highlight priorities for management. We demonstrate an application of
   this new framework - the Freshwater Health Index (FHI) - in the
   Dongjiang River Basin in southern China, where stakeholders are
   addressing multiple and conflicting freshwater demands. By combining
   empirical and modeled datasets with surveys to gauge stakeholders'
   preferences and elicit expert information about governance mechanisms,
   the FHI helps stakeholders understand the status of freshwater
   ecosystems in their basin, how ecosystems are being manipulated to
   enhance or decrease water-related services, and howwell the existing
   water resource management regime is equipped to govern these dynamics
   over time. This framework helps to operationalize a truly integrated
   approach to water resource management by recognizing the interplay
   between governance, stakeholders, freshwater ecosystems and the services
   they provide. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Abstract = {East African wetlands are hotspots of ecosystem services, particularly
   for climate regulation, water provision and food production. We review
   the ability of current approaches to ecosystem service assessments to
   capture important social-ecological dynamics to provide insight for
   wetland management and human wellbeing. We synthesise evidence of human
   influences on wetlands and gauge the suitability of models and tools for
   simulating spatial and temporal dynamics, and land management on
   multiple ecosystem functions and services. Current approaches are
   largely unsuitable for advancing knowledge of social-ecological system
   dynamics and could be greatly improved with inter-disciplinary model
   integration to focus upon interactions between multiple ecosystem
   functions and services. Modelling can alleviate challenges that tropical
   wetland ecosystem services management faces and support decision-making
   of land managers and policymakers. Better understanding of
   social-ecological systems dynamics is crucial in East Africa where
   societies are vulnerable to poverty and climate variability, whilst
   dependent upon agrarian-ecological based economies. (c) 2018 Elsevier

Title = {Social-ecological interactions in the Draa River Basin, southern
   Morocco: Towards nature conservation and human well-being using the
   IPBES framework},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {769},
Month = {MAY 15},
Abstract = {Water is essential to human societies and a prerequisite for flourishing
   nature, especially in arid regions. Yet, climate change and
   socio-economic developments are expected to exacerbate current and
   future stresses on water resources, demanding innovative approaches to
   balance water needs for society and nature conservation.
   In this study, we use the IPBES conceptual framework to combine
   ecological and socio-economic insights and analyse the connections
   between people and nature in the water scarce Draa River Basin, southern
   Morocco. We study the diversity of desert benthic macroinvertebrates as
   one component of nature using DNA barcoding and their potential to serve
   as bioindicators of human impact by relating species occurrences to
   environmental parameters. Furthermore, based on 87 interviews with
   farmers and key institutional stakeholders, we investigate how farmers
   perceive water related changes and how water is managed in the basin.
   Regarding benthic macroinvertebrates, 41 families were identified, 475
   DNA barcodes generated and assigned to 118 putative species (Barcode
   Index Numbers) of which 60 were first records. This indicates a lack of
   reference sequences for known, but also a potentially high number of
   undescribed species. Environmental parameters, which are partly
   influenced by human activities, such as aquatic stages, salinity and
   intermittency, were the most important variables explaining invertebrate
   richness and community composition in generalized linear models. We
   further describe farmers perceptions of decreasing water quality and
   quantity. Farmers generally believe that they are able to cope with
   water related changes, although perceptions are regionally
   differentiated with farmers downstream being less optimistic. With
   growing concerns, water policies currently locus on increasing water
   supply and less on reducing water demands.
   Based on these findings, the usefulness of the IPBES framework for
   understanding social-ecological system dynamics is reflected, and
   recommendations for future freshwater management and research are
   derived. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Learning Dilemmas in a Social-Ecological System: An Agent-Based Modeling

Abstract = {The process of learning in social-ecological systems is an emerging area
   of research, but little attention has been given to how social and
   ecological interactions motivate or inhibit learning. This is highly
   relevant to the South African water sector, where a major policy
   transition is occurring that provides local water users and managers
   with new opportunities to engage in adaptive learning about how to
   balance human and ecological needs for water. In this paper, an
   agent-based model is used to explore potential `learning dilemmas', or
   barriers to learning in the South African water sector, whereby human
   perceptions combined with social-ecological conditions affect the
   capacity, understanding, and willingness required to learn. Agents
   manage water according to different management strategies and use
   various indicators to evaluate their success. The model shows that in
   areas with highly variable hydrological regimes, agents may be less able
   to learn because conditions are too unpredictable for them to benefit
   from past experience. Because of these changing conditions, however,
   agents are more likely to try new water management strategies, promoting
   a greater diversity of experience in the system for agents to learn from
   in the future. In water-stressed areas, where agents tend to have
   greater difficulty fulfilling demand for water than in areas with
   abundant water supplies, they are also more apt to try new strategies.
   When learning is restricted to small areas, agents may learn more
   quickly but based on a more narrow range of experience than in larger or
   more heterogeneous areas. These results suggest a need to enhance
   learning so that it accounts for interacting hydrological, ecological,
   and social dynamics. Although the model is a highly stylised version of
   reality, this preliminary exploration may eventually help to reverse the
   past trend of poor understanding of social-ecological dynamics as they
   relate to water management.},

Abstract = {``Environmental flows{''} is a research discipline that emphasizes
   freshwater allocation in rivers to sustain desired ecological conditions
   and human well-being. The basis for environmental flow requirements has
   traditionally relied on hydrological and ecological data. Contemporary
   methods focus on detailed hydro-ecological relationships within river
   ecosystems; however, there is currently no structured approach to
   systematically incorporate socially relevant data into the environmental
   flows discipline. To address this limitation we developed a flexible
   framework that applies a social-ecological systems approach to account
   for multiple flow-related objectives that reflect both biophysical
   sustainability and societal preferences. First, we conceptualize the
   freshwater social-ecological system as a hierarchy of human and
   environmental domains. Then, we recommend stepwise procedures to assess
   flow-related vulnerabilities of important system attributes, address
   their feedbacks, and translate these assessments to a common
   classification for comparative analyses that guide holistic flow
   management decisions.},

Journal = {REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {24},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Mountains are social-ecological systems exposed to multiple climatic and
   socioeconomic drivers. The Pyrenees are a clear example of the
   concomitant challenges that these regions face, as they are exposed to
   stressors linked to depopulation, an economic shift towards tourism, and
   climate change. To understand how these multiple stressors affect the
   system's resources, it is useful to study them from a social-ecological
   system (SES) perspective. Focusing on a Pyrenean SES, we use piecewise
   structural equation modeling and network analysis to quantitatively
   describe the interactions between water resources, biodiversity, and the
   social and economic elements of the system. Our results show that the
   current economic focus and dependency on tourism severely impact water
   resources and biodiversity. Future climatic scenarios forecast a
   worsening of the pressures on the hydrological system and may threaten
   winter tourism. Actions to alleviate the pressures on water and
   biodiversity and to increase socioeconomic resilience are a priority. We
   argue that such actions will have to include both a diversification of
   the region's touristic offer and of the economy, coupled with a more
   sustainable use of water resources. Our findings highlight the
   importance of studying the interactions and causal relationships between
   SES elements. This can help gain a comprehensive understanding of how
   the SES functions and its sustainability challenges.},

Title = {Citizen Science as a Co-Creative Measure to Water Quality: Chemical Data
   and Local Participation in a Rural Territory},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {SEP 21},
Abstract = {It is becoming increasingly clear that the threat to the use of natural
   landscapes and persistent droughts are affecting the water quality of
   rural communities. The socio-ecological fit emerges as an aid to advance
   in the search for solutions to environmental problems in rural
   communities. Consequently, between May 2016 and September 2021, an
   interdisciplinary study of community-based water quality monitoring
   (CWQM) was implemented at a coastal catchment in the Nuble region,
   Central Chile. The objective of the study was to involve the
   participation of local communities in initiatives to control the water
   quality of various parameters {[}pH, total iron (Fe-T), alkalinity as
   CaCO3, hardness (Ca2+ and Mg2+), sodium (Na+) and potassium (K+), water
   temperature, sulfate (SO42-) chloride (Cl-), and nitrate (NO3-)] in
   groundwater, share local knowledge, and apply co-creative measures for
   improving water conservation. In situ chemical data were also analyzed
   in the laboratory to check data quality. The PHREEQC hydrogeochemical
   model is used to characterize hydrogeochemical parameters of groundwater
   and to know about hydrogeochemical processes related to water quality.
   High levels of NO3- and Fe-T are recorded in 75\% of the groundwater
   samples, mainly when water scarcity is higher during the summer.
   According to Chilean standards, nitrate levels exceed the maximum
   permissible limits for drinking water. A type of mainly Ca (Mg)-HCO3-
   carbonated water was recorded with Ca2+, Na+, Mg2+, and HCO3- as
   dominant ions. This study demonstrated the opportunity of a rural
   community group to help fill spatial data gaps in water quality
   monitoring and reassess water quality protection, especially considering
   the decrease in water availability in the region. Therefore, the
   community together with researchers can respond with an early alert
   system to water quality to collaborate with the implementation of rural
   drinking established on a community-based water quality monitoring.
   Moreover, to prioritize the level of urgency of rural water, minimize
   water pollution and improve the perception of the water and the
   resilience of their social-ecological system.},

Abstract = {This study assesses social vulnerability to hazards by analyzing the
   nature of biophysical hazards, and the characteristics of exposures,
   susceptibilities and adaptive capacities in Kumasi. A mixed method
   approach was used to collect primary data from farms and nearby markets.
   Water, soil, and plant samples were collected and tested for total
   coliforms and cadmium. Primary dataset was also collected from farmers
   and vendors using structured interview guide and from key informants
   through in-depth interviews. The analysis shows that several pressures
   residing within the coupled social-ecological system are threats to the
   health and livelihood of the farmers and vendors. The concentration of
   cadmium and total coliform in irrigation water, soil, and plants
   exceeded the WHO/FAO acceptable standards. Bio-toxins in plants were
   also found to be potentially high. However, the degree of exposure to
   these stressors and the strength of response and adaptive capacities
   were determined to be dependent on position within the urban agriculture
   value chain, type of plant, and socio-demographic characteristics. The
   study concludes that pollution of irrigation water, soil, and plant is
   an issue of environmental concern in the urban agriculture system and
   requires concerted efforts of all stakeholders to address. It is
   recommended that there should be frequent monitoring of the quality of
   irrigation water, soil, and produce from urban farms and markets to
   assess their physical, chemical, and microbial properties and possibly
   initiate remedial measures where necessary. Government policies must
   also focus on building the resilience of urban farmers and vendors to
   reduce their vulnerability to biophysical hazards.},

Abstract = {Environmental flows (e-flows) management takes place within a complex
   social-ecological system, necessitating the involvement of diverse
   stakeholders and an appreciation of a range of perspectives and
   knowledge types. It is widely accepted that incorporating participatory
   methods into environmental flows decision-making will allow stakeholders
   to become meaningfully involved, improving potential solutions, and
   fostering social legitimacy. However, due to substantial structural
   barriers, implementing participatory approaches can be difficult for
   water managers. This paper assesses the effectiveness of an e-flows
   methodology that combines elements of structured decision-making and
   participatory modeling, whilst constrained by project resources. Three
   process-based objectives were identified by the group at the start of
   the process: improving transparency, knowledge exchange, and community
   ownership. We evaluated the success of the approach according to those
   objectives using semi-structured interviews and thematic analysis. In
   evaluating how well the participatory approach achieved the process
   objectives, we found that at least 80\% of respondents expressed
   positive sentiment in every category (n = 15). We demonstrate that the
   values-based process objectives defined by the participant group are an
   effective tool for evaluating participatory success. This paper
   highlights that participatory approaches can be effective even in
   resource-constrained environments when the process is adapted to fit the
   decision-making context.},

Title = {Evaluating the Management of a Tropical Reservoir: Implications of
   Climate Change for Water Availability},
Journal = {PACIFIC SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {74},
Number = {2},
Pages = {115-135},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Most tropical islands have limited water supply due to the small size of
   their watersheds and aquifers, unique geology, and distribution of
   rainfall; each affecting the reliability of water resources for meeting
   agricultural needs. To improve water supply, reservoirs provide critical
   storage of surface water. However, climate-driven shifts in the
   distribution, intensity, and amount of rainfall will alter runoff that
   feeds reservoirs. Mass-balance modeling was used to evaluate the effects
   of various management constraints on water availability for the Wahiawa
   Reservoir (O'ahu, Hawai'i) as well as the impact of 20\% less dry season
   rainfall and stream flow to assess the effect of projected climate
   change on maintaining: (1) a minimum downstream flow; (2) a minimum
   agricultural supply; (3) a minimum and maximum reservoir level; and (4)
   a combination of minimum downstream flow and minimum agricultural
   supply. Under current climate conditions, maintaining a minimal
   downstream water release could be met with minimal consequences for
   agricultural supply and reservoir level. However, both agricultural
   supply and downstream flow had to be reduced during dry periods to keep
   the reservoir level above a minimum level. Maintaining a minimum
   downstream flow resulted in a 4.2\% reduction in mean agricultural
   supply and 2.2 \% reduction in mean reservoir elevation compared to
   baseline conditions. By contrast, a 20\% reduction in dry season water
   inputs resulted in a 17.8\% reduction in mean agricultural supply in the
   minimum downstream flow scenario compared to current rainfall
   conditions. Furthermore, the number of days the reservoir level dropped
   below the minimum needed for a fishery increased (range 1.15-25x) across
   scenarios compared to baseline. Successful management of surface water
   within a social-ecological system will be challenged by the increasing
   unpredictability of rainfall.},

Abstract = {Rice production in coastal wetlands provides critical ecosystem services
   that range from flood control to wildlife habitat. In the Iberian
   Peninsula rice was introduced in the 10th Century. Today Iberian rice
   accounts for about one quarter of the total rice production of the
   European Union, almost exclusively cultivated in the coastal wetlands of
   Spain, with permanent flooding. The intensive water management required
   to produce rice stands at a crucial point since freshwater supply is
   deteriorating at an unprecedented rate. Here we explore flexible
   adaptation options to climate change in the Doana wetlands - a world
   heritage and biodiversity site - from two points of view: What are the
   policy options for agricultural water management in view of climate
   change? How can informed stakeholders contribute to better adaptation?
   The first question is addressed by simulating water availability to
   farmers with the WAAPA model under a range of adaptation policy options
   derived from the view of the local communities. The second question was
   addressed by means of participatory research. Adaptation options are
   framed according to the local environmental, social and policy context.
   Results suggest that perception on the potential role of new water
   infrastructure and farming subsidies dominates the view of local
   communities. The choices of the stakeholders that could be simulated
   with the hydrological model, were quantified in terms of additional
   water availability for the rice farming, therefore providing a
   quantitative measure to the qualitative solutions. Information provided
   during the study shaped the final adaptation options developed. Our
   research contributes to the definition of sustainable rice production in
   Europe.},

Abstract = {This study takes an historical approach in order to establish how the
   form and function of the social-ecological system that represents the
   Bangladesh south-western coastal zone has changed over recent decades.
   Time series data for a range of ecosystem services and drivers are
   analysed to define the range of trends, the presence of change points,
   slow and fast variables and the significant drivers of change. Since the
   1980s, increasing gross domestic product and per capita income mirror
   rising levels of food and inland fish production. As a result, the size
   of population below the poverty line has reduced by similar to 17 \%. In
   contrast, non-food ecosystem services such as water availability, water
   quality and land stability have deteriorated. Conversion of rice fields
   to shrimp farms is almost certainly a factor in increasing soil and
   surface water salinity. Most of the services experienced statistically
   significant change points between 1975 and 1980, and among the services,
   water availability, shrimp farming and maintenance of biodiversity
   appear to have passed tipping points. An environmental Kuznets curve
   analysis suggests that the point at which growing economic wealth feeds
   back into effective environmental protection has not yet been reached
   for water resources. Trends in indicators of ecosystem services and
   human well-being point to widespread non-stationary dynamics governed by
   slowly changing variables with an increased likelihood of systemic
   threshold changes/tipping points in the near future. The results will
   feed into simulation models and strategies that can define alternative
   and sustainable paths for land management.},

Volume = {27},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {1031-1050},

Abstract = {Based on a five-town case-study cohort in Kenya, a conceptual framework
   has been developed to enable the formulation of holistic and effective
   strategies that encompass the national aspirations and regional to
   global sustainability agendas, and which can be used to monitor progress
   in achieving set objectives. The approach is flexible, scalable and
   transferrable, so that it can be applied in different contexts and using
   different indicators, based upon the same construct. Insufficient
   technical knowledge of urban aquifers and their interplay with the wider
   social-ecological system constrains the development of holistic,
   effective and robust management systems to ensure their sustainability
   for intended uses. The objective was to consider governance and
   management solutions that could promote water security for urban towns
   in Kenya through the sustainable use of groundwater in the context of
   its complex hydrogeology, water access disparities, competing uses and
   future risks. The in force national and county water policies,
   strategies, and plans for the case study areas were critically reviewed.
   The status of aquifer knowledge, water access disparities, competing
   uses, and risks was evaluated from critical literature reviews and data
   compilation, fieldwork, and analysis of indicator datasets from the
   Kenya 2009 census. Key aquifers need urgent characterisation to reverse
   the current situation whereby development proceeds with insufficient
   aquifer knowledge. Private sector and public participation in management
   should be enhanced through decentralised management approaches. Water
   infrastructure and technologies should be fit-for-purpose in application
   and scale, and the pro-poor focus should be underpinned by appropriately
   focused management regimes.},

Abstract = {Communities in dryland ecosystems face multiple stressors that threaten
   their livelihood resilience. While community resilience in
   socio-ecological systems is largely determined by access to and
   sustainable management of natural resources, the underlying mechanisms
   are still poorly understood. This study, which uses grounded theory
   integrated with discourse analysis, aims to contribute addressing this
   knowledge gap. First, we explore global literature describing trends and
   patterns in the various stressors-including climate change, frequent
   drought, and famine, ecological, socio-economic, and institutional
   stressors-that impact the livelihood resilience of these communities,
   with the goal of summarizing how multiple stressors impact the
   sustainability of dryland social-ecological systems. Then, using the
   sustainable development goals (SDGs) as a reference target, we propose
   potential entry points to support livelihood resilience pathways. These
   include land, water, livestock and agroforestry, and institutional and
   social capital. Lastly, we suggest an integrated multi-scalar pathway
   embedded with cross-sectorial policies and differential cross-social
   strategies towards combining resilience with SDGs targets. This research
   can help stakeholders to adapt to and mitigate the impacts of various
   stressors, ultimately strengthening livelihood resilience in dryland
   ecosystems.},

Title = {Environmental Governance Dynamics: Some Micro Foundations of Macro
   Failures},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {170},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {This article proposes a new theoretical explanation to the question of
   environmental governance failures, combining micro and macro
   explanations in the long run. We put forward the concept of Transversal
   Transaction Costs (TTCs) as a critical source of governance failures.
   TTCs are transaction costs induced by interlinkages between public
   policies and property rights, an area under-investigated by the natural
   resources governance literature. We emphasise that TTCs are
   consequential in limiting the ability of environmental governance to
   coordinate natural resource uses. Drawing on institutional complementary
   and cluster literature, we argue that TTCs increased significantly over
   the years shaping governance evolution at the macro level in the long
   run. We show that institutional resource regimes tend to get locked into
   an Institutional Complexity Trap (ICT), which prevents improvement in
   coordination capacity and explains the persistence of environmental
   governance failures. Four cases substantiate our conceptual proposition
   of transversal transaction costs. In addition, the process-tracing of
   six water governance cases in Europe from 1750 to 2004 provides
   empirical support to the macro dynamics of institutional complexity
   trap.},

Volume = {283},

Month = {JAN 13},
Abstract = {Sustainable use of common-pool resources such as fish, water or forests
   depends on the cooperation of resource users that restrain their
   individual extraction to socially optimal levels. Empirical evidence has
   shown that under certain social and biophysical conditions,
   self-organized cooperation in the commons can evolve. Global change,
   however, may drastically alter these conditions. We assess the
   robustness of cooperation to environmental variability in a stylized
   model of a community that harvests a shared resource. Community members
   follow a norm of socially optimal resource extraction, which is enforced
   through social sanctioning. Our results indicate that both resource
   abundance and a small increase in resource variability can lead to
   collapse of cooperation observed in the no-variability case, while
   either scarcity or large variability have the potential to stabilize it.
   The combined effects of changes in amount and variability can reinforce
   or counteract each other depending on their size and the initial level
   of cooperation in the community. If two socially separate groups are
   ecologically connected through resource leakage, cooperation in one can
   destabilize the other. These findings provide insights into possible
   effects of global change and spatial connectivity, indicating that there
   is no simple answer as to their effects on cooperation and sustainable
   resource use.},

Title = {Eutrophication, water quality, and fisheries: a wicked management
   problem with insights from a century of change in Lake Erie},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {28},
Number = {3},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Human-driven nutrient inputs into aquatic ecosystems must be managed to
   preserve biodiversity and to ensure that valued fishery and water
   quality services are not compromised by hypoxia and harmful algal
   blooms. Aiming for nutrient inputs that achieve an intermediate level of
   ecosystem productivity is expected to provide both high fish yield and
   good water quality. However, we argue that such an intermediate
   ``optimum{''} may not exist for many aquatic ecosystems that support
   multiple fisheries with differing tolerances to eutrophication and that
   must provide multiple water quality services. We further support this
   argument with an empirical case study of nearly a century (1915-2011) of
   change in the productivity of Lake Erie and its lake whitefish
   (Coregonus clupeaformis), walleye (Sander vitreus), and yellow perch
   (Perca flavescens) fisheries. We discuss and show how the harvest of
   each fishery has been historically maximized at different levels of
   ecosystem productivity. Additionally, we examine how anticipated
   management efforts to improve water quality by reducing nutrient inputs
   (i.e., oligotrophication) may favor certain fisheries over others,
   resulting in no single optimal range of nutrient inputs that achieves
   all valued fishery and water quality objectives. Our synthesis and case
   study illustrate how the need to balance multiple services in aquatic
   ecosystems can create a wicked management problem with inevitable
   trade-offs. To navigate these trade-offs, we recommend the use of
   ecosystem-based management approaches, which can help decision makers
   identify and resolve complex trade-offs by facilitating cooperative
   research and communication among water quality regulators, fisheries
   managers, and end users.},

Title = {Integrated pond aquaculture and regional identity: ethnobiology of the
   golden humped tench of Poirino highlands, Northwest Italy},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ETHNOBIOLOGY AND ETHNOMEDICINE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Number = {1},
Month = {APR 11},
Abstract = {Background Social-ecological systems are based on particular species and
   on their direct and human-mediated interactions. The `golden humped
   tench' or tinca gobba dorata, a variety of tench-Tinca tinca (L.,
   1758)-traditionally bred in artificial ponds called peschiere in Poirino
   highlands, northwest Italy, is one of such species. The aim of the study
   is to investigate the traditional farming of the golden humped tench,
   the associated knowledge, practices, and gastronomy, and to discuss the
   changes that the tench, the ponds, and their role in the local
   social-ecological system are going through. Methods The data analyzed
   were collected in different locations of Poirino highlands during
   May-September 2021. Fieldwork included semi-structured interviews (n =
   23) with current and former tench farmers about the breeding and
   gastronomy of the tench and the management of the peschiere. The
   interviewees' selection occurred through an exponential
   non-discriminative snowball sampling, and interview transcripts were
   qualitatively analyzed through inductive thematic content analysis.
   Results The golden humped tench has been farmed for centuries in ponds
   used also to water livestock and to irrigate cultivated fields, and
   managed by every peasant household in the area. This integrated
   aquaculture system is underpinned by detailed knowledge on the peschiera
   ecosystem and on the tench life cycle and supports a gastronomic
   knowledge that is part of the local heritage. The ongoing process of
   gastronomic valorization of the tench is sustaining the role of the fish
   in locals' livelihoods and as a marker of regional identity, but it is
   also transforming tench farming, already threatened by livelihood
   change, pesticides, and invasive species, in controversial ways.
   Conclusions We argue that ponds and tenches are core elements of the
   local social-ecological system, defining the cultural landscape and
   engendering a form of regional identity around them. Studying integrated
   aquaculture systems and associated knowledge and practices is relevant
   to design sustainable systems of food production and to address
   possibilities of conservation of biodiversity and livelihoods in aquatic
   environments.},

Title = {A social-ecological framework for analyzing and designing integrated
   crop-livestock systems from farm to territory levels},
Journal = {RENEWABLE AGRICULTURE AND FOOD SYSTEMS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {32},
Number = {1},
Pages = {43-56},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Integrated crop-livestock systems are often considered a promising way
   to address agricultural sustainability issues. Many authors claim that
   complementarities and synergies between crops and livestock can improve
   nutrient cycling and delivery of ecosystem services (ES) in agricultural
   systems. They have analyzed effects of interactions at the farm level
   and affirmed the potential advantage of developing crop-livestock
   interactions at the territory level. However, potential benefits of
   developing synergies beyond the farm level have not been clearly
   identified. Thus, we developed a conceptual framework that can be used
   to analyze, design and perform integrated assessment of crop-livestock
   systems at the territory level. To address crop-livestock interaction
   issues, we define it as a social-ecological system called the
   territorial crop-livestock system (TCLS). The ecological system is
   represented as three interacting components, crops, grasslands and
   animals, allowing description of various land uses and their potential
   effects on nutrient cycling and ES. The social system, represented as
   farmers interacting with natural-resource managers and agro-food chain
   actors, determines land use and the nature and intensity of ES
   delivered. We highlight the importance of coordination and learning
   among actors to support implementation of complex adaptive systems such
   as TCLSs. We illustrate the expressive power of our conceptual framework
   through development of a generic typology of crop-livestock systems.
   Then we show how our conceptual framework can be used as an intermediary
   object with stakeholders in participatory design approaches. We
   illustrate this process by representing four archetypal TCLSs. We
   provide an example of the design approach implemented in Southwestern
   France to address severe recurrent water shortages, which includes
   analysis of land use in the current crop-livestock system and the
   associated key metabolic and ES issues, identification of options for
   change and multi-criteria analysis of these options. We conclude that
   this framework shows great potential to support development of
   sustainable farming systems at the territory level.},

Title = {Combining paleolimnological proxies to understand the long-term
   social-ecological interactions: A case study in the Erhai basin,
   Southwest China},
Journal = {QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {592},
Pages = {60-66},
Month = {AUG 10},
Abstract = {Understanding social-ecological interactions is a major research
   priority for sustainable management. However, the scarcity in
   multi-decadal records represents a big gap in information that hinders
   the development of above research. In this paper, we propose a framework
   to explore the long-term dynamic mechanisms between social and
   ecological systems, and present a case study in the Erhai basin,
   southwest China. Using paleolimnological proxies to reconstruct the
   long-term trends of ecological changes, the social-ecological system
   (SES) framework links the variations of ecosystem services (ESs) and
   ecosystem functions with social policies. According to the results of
   the Erhai basin, there were increasing social demands and wanted
   provisioning ESs but degraded ecosystem functions over the last 70
   years. Typically, the introduction of four major Chinese carps since the
   1950s, the construction of hydropower stations on the Xi'er river since
   the 1970s, and the development of tourism since the 1990s, have been
   implemented to meet the social demands for wanted fish provisioning,
   hydroelectricity provisioning, and culture services respectively.
   Although there were temporary benefits in above desired services,
   improper strategies have gradually impaired the functions of native fish
   diversity, hydrodynamic forces, and nutrient cycling. Degraded ecosystem
   functions threatened the sustainable provision of wanted ESs, which
   motivated the implementation of subsequent social policies, such as the
   fishing ban after the 1950s, water level control after the 1970s and
   restoration projects after the 1990s. By rounds of renewed social
   drivers/ policies, the social system and ecosystem in the Erhai basin
   are tightly connected in the form of a feedback loop in the SES,
   rendering dynamic changes in wanted ESs. The current social-ecological
   trap in the Erhai basin emphasizes the significance of SES framework and
   advantages of a paleolimnological approach in revealing the long-term
   SES dynamics, which can help tailor proper management measures in the
   future.},

Abstract = {Large hydrologic basins involve multiple stakeholders, and coupled
   dynamic social and ecological processes. Managing such basins has long
   been a challenge. Balancing the demand for water from nature against
   that from humans is always difficult, particularly in arid watersheds.
   Here, we analyze potential institutional causes of ecological
   degradation and how it can be reversed by introducing new forms of
   governance. The framework and assumptions are illustrated using China's
   second-largest endorheic basin, where empirical evidence shows that the
   introduction of a new governing authority connecting midstream and
   downstream actors facilitated the establishment of a new governance
   regime that is better aligned with the biophysical scales of the
   watershed. A trans-regional water allocation project initiated by the
   new higher-level authority successfully rescued downstream oases and
   restored a dried terminal lake. These outcomes suggest that when social
   and ecological structures are better aligned our ability to manage the
   interplay between social and ecological processes increases. However,
   the lack of direct connection between the actors of the middle and lower
   reaches resulted in the paradox of an increase in water demand. We
   therefore suggest that measures to stimulate the emergence of horizontal
   social ties linking different critical groups of actors across the
   watershed could further the alignment of the institutional and
   biophysical structures-without these changes sustainable management of
   river basins and other common pool resources will remain problematic.

Abstract = {Ongoing urban expansion may degrade natural resources, ecosystems, and
   the services they provide to human societies, e.g., through land use and
   water changes and feedbacks. In order to control and minimize such
   negative impacts of urbanization, best practices for sustainable urban
   development must be identified, supported, and reinforced. To accomplish
   this, assessment methods and tools need to consider the couplings and
   feedbacks between social and ecological systems, as the basis for
   improving the planning and management of urban development.
   Collaborative efforts by academics, urban planners, and other relevant
   actors are also essential in this context. This will require relevant
   methods and tools for testing and projecting scenarios of coupled
   social-ecological system (CSES) behavior, changes, and feedbacks, in
   support of sustainable development of growing cities. This paper
   presents a CSES modeling approach that can provide such support, by
   coupling socio-economically driven land use changes and associated
   hydrological changes. The paper exemplifies and tests the applicability
   of this approach for a concrete case study with relevant data
   availability, the Tyresan catchment in Stockholm County, Sweden. Results
   show that model integration in the approach can reveal impacts of
   urbanization on hydrological and water resource, and the implications
   and feedbacks for urban societies and ecosystems. The CSES approach
   introduces new model challenges, but holds promise for improved model
   support towards sustainable urban development.},

Title = {Towards sustainable small-scale fisheries in China: A case study of
   Hainan},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {121},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {China is one of the most important marine fishery countries, yet little
   is known about its small-scale fisheries (SSFs). This paper uses Hainan
   Province of China as a case study to examine the present situation,
   predicaments, and future changes of the country's SSFs during a process
   of transition from extensive to green development. In doing so, we
   follow the social-ecological system (SES) framework to present Hainan's
   SSF-related settings, and study its resource systems, governance systems
   and actors through reviewing national and local policies, surveying and
   interviewing SSF stakeholders. Marine fisheries in Hainan is
   SSF-dominated, experienced dramatic increase in terms of yield and jobs
   since 1978, and became the main source of most fishermen's livelihood.
   Fish community structure and fishing targets have shifted from a mix of
   large-bodied demersals and pelagics to smaller-bodied pelagics with high
   growth rates and fecundity levels. This degradation puts stress on
   China's central and local governments to enhance the preservation of
   marine ecosystems. Effort controls failed to reduce fishing power due to
   subsidies, a series of measures were introduced in 2015 to correct these
   problems, including obligatory targets with accountability, subsidy
   reductions, buyback program, and further reductions of fishing vessels
   and allowable catch implemented in 2017. Hainan has explored different
   development directions for SSFs. First, providing policies and funds to
   reduce small fishing boats and construct larger vessels to support
   offshore and distant-water fisheries. Second, enhancing fishery value by
   integrating the development of fishery related primary, secondary, and
   tertiary industries. Third, developing existing SSFs in a sustainable
   manner through standardizing SSF vessel types, delineating operating
   areas, developing fishing port economy, and building beautiful fishing
   villages. These practices illustrate that China's centralized government
   can likely command transformational changes in ecological and
   socio-economic outcomes according to policy objectives. Also, a
   broadened perspective that considers the ecological, social, and
   economic dimensions of SSFs as whole is also crucial. Moreover, the
   integration of fishery policies with other related socioeconomic
   policies, and the interdepartmental cooperation is needed to achieve
   policy consistency across local governments.},

Title = {Coupled human and natural system dynamics as key to the sustainability
   of Lake Victoria's ecosystem services},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {19},
Number = {4},
Abstract = {East Africa's Lake Victoria provides resources and services to millions
   of people on the lake's shores and abroad. In particular, the lake's
   fisheries are an important source of protein, employment, and
   international economic connections for the whole region. Nonetheless,
   stock dynamics are poorly understood and currently unpredictable.
   Furthermore, fishery dynamics are intricately connected to other
   supporting services of the lake as well as to lakeshore societies and
   economies. Much research has been carried out piecemeal on different
   aspects of Lake Victoria's system; e.g., societies, biodiversity,
   fisheries, and eutrophication. However, to disentangle drivers and
   dynamics of change in this complex system, we need to put these pieces
   together and analyze the system as a whole. We did so by first building
   a qualitative model of the lake's social-ecological system. We then
   investigated the model system through a qualitative loop analysis, and
   finally examined effects of changes on the system state and structure.
   The model and its contextual analysis allowed us to investigate
   system-wide chain reactions resulting from disturbances. Importantly, we
   built a tool that can be used to analyze the cascading effects of
   management options and establish the requirements for their success. We
   found that high connectedness of the system at the exploitation level,
   through fisheries having multiple target stocks, can increase the
   stocks' vulnerability to exploitation but reduce society's vulnerability
   to variability in individual stocks. We describe how there are multiple
   pathways to any change in the system, which makes it difficult to
   identify the root cause of changes but also broadens the management
   toolkit. Also, we illustrate how nutrient enrichment is not a
   self-regulating process, and that explicit management is necessary to
   halt or reverse eutrophication. This model is simple and usable to
   assess system-wide effects of management policies, and can serve as a
   paving stone for future quantitative analyses of system dynamics at
   local scales.},

Title = {Governance of alluvial aquifers and community participation: a
   social-ecological systems analysis of the Brazilian semi-arid region},

Abstract = {Small and shallow alluvial aquifers in arid and semi-arid regions
   compose an important water system that smallholder farmers rely on for
   irrigation and livestock feeding. Geological settings and the small
   scale of these aquifers suggest the need for governance at the local
   level, but research supporting its development is still scarce. Treating
   a case of alluvial aquifers exploited by smallholder farmers located in
   the Brazilian semi-arid region as a common pool resource (CPR), this
   paper analyses the governance of a social-ecological system (SES) for
   which an alluvial aquifer is an essential source of water. The paper
   applies the SES Framework to analyse the SES in light of Ostrom's
   principles for sustainable CPR management to answer the questions: (1)
   can the governance arrangements support sustainable common pool resource
   management of the alluvial aquifers? (2) what opportunities are there to
   make the management of the aquifer more sustainable through
   community-based governance? (3) can Ostrom's design principles lead the
   transition to more sustainable governance of alluvial aquifers? Despite
   a water policy aiming for decentralisation and participatory governance,
   gaps in the implementation of these policies are identified. Taking into
   account the challenges imposed by the aquifer characteristics to impact
   efficient groundwater exploitation, equity in water distribution and
   conservation of the CPR, the analysis reveals opportunities to improve
   CPR management by supporting the community to increase participation in
   the governance of the aquifer in coordination with existing policies.
   This work concludes with suggestions that could empower community
   progress towards more sustainable governance of the aquifer.},

Title = {A Societal Metabolism Approach to Effectively Analyze the
   Water-Energy-Food Nexus in an Agricultural Transboundary River Basin},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},

Abstract = {We implemented the semantically open conceptual framework `Multi-Scale
   Integrated Analysis of Societal and Ecosystem Metabolism' (MuSIASEM) to
   deal with nexus challenges in agricultural production systems in
   transboundary river basins, using the Iranian Aras River Basin as a case
   study. The performance of the agricultural sector was characterized for
   relevant typologies of crop production using metabolic profiles, i.e.,
   inputs and outputs per ton of crop produced, per hectare of land use,
   and per hour of labor. This analysis was contextualized across
   hierarchical levels of analysis, including the agronomic context at the
   regional level (rainfed versus irrigated cultivation), the
   socio-economic and political context at the national level (food
   sovereignty; urbanization), and the hydro-ecological context of the
   larger transboundary river basin (water constraints, GHG emissions). We
   found that the simultaneous use of two different interrelated logics of
   aggregation-the productivity of land and labor (relevant for the
   agronomic and socio-economic dimension) and the density of flows under
   different land uses (relevant for the hydrological and ecological
   dimension)-allowed for the identification of trade-offs in policy
   deliberations. In the case of Iran, it showed that striving for
   strategic autonomy will exacerbate the current water crisis; with the
   current cropping patterns, agronomic improvements will not suffice to
   avert a water crisis. It was concluded that the proposed approach fills
   an important gap in nexus research, but to effectively guide nexus
   governance in the region, a co-production of the analysis with social
   actors as well as more complete data sets at the river basin level would
   be essential.},

Title = {Individual and collective political efficacy predict farmer engagement

   Sustainable Groundwater Management Act},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {29},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Common-pool resource theory suggests that the direct participation of
   local natural resource users in the management of common-pool resources
   can lead to effective management regimes. Nevertheless, the drivers of
   participation in common-pool resource management, including policy
   decision processes, and the effects of participation on stakeholder
   attitudes and policy preferences are relatively understudied. Here, we
   combine the social-ecological system (SES) framework with the political
   science concept of political efficacy to examine both contextual and
   personal drivers of farmer participation in California, USA's 2014
   Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA), as well as the effect of
   participation on support for policy mechanisms from the SGMA. We
   surveyed a total of 553 farmers in three counties across the California
   Central Valley and Central Coast. Overall, we find that < 50\% of the
   farmers surveyed have participated in any SGMA-related events, with
   attending a meeting being the most common (45\%), and testifying before
   a board being the least common (6\%). Participation in any type of SGMA
   policy event was associated with multiple characteristics of the
   groundwater SES context, including the resource system (farm size) and
   actor attributes (farm bureau membership and receiving information about
   the policy), that likely combine to indicate a higher level of social,
   financial, and built capital. Higher participation was also associated
   with higher internal efficacy ratings, i.e., an individual's
   self-assessment of their ability to understand and participate in the
   political process. Higher levels of internal efficacy were also
   correlated with support for both incentive-and regulatory-based policy
   mechanisms, as well as the perception that groundwater impacts are
   occurring now or soon, and exclusive reliance on groundwater. These
   results demonstrate that political competence and experience with policy
   processes and programs are not only associated with participation in
   current policy issues, which is widely recognized in existing research,
   but are also associated with mechanisms, in with more mechanisms.},

Title = {Evolution of the societal value of water resources for economic
   development versus environmental sustainability in Australia from 1843
   to 2011},
Journal = {GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {42},
Pages = {82-92},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Societal values are generally seen as leading to changes in human
   decisions and behavior, but have not been addressed adequately in
   current water management, which is blind to changes in the social
   drivers for, or societal responses to, management decisions. This paper
   describes the evolution of the societal value of water resources in
   Australia over a period of 169 years. These values were classified into
   two groups: those supporting economic development versus those
   supporting environmental sustainability. The Sydney Morning Herald
   newspaper was used as the main data source to track the changes in the
   societal value of water resources. Content analysis was used to create a
   description of the evolution of these societal values. Mathematical
   regression analysis, in combination of transition theory, was used to
   determine the stages of transition of the societal value, and the
   co-evolved social-ecological framework was used to explain how the
   evolution of societal values interacted with water management policies
   and practices, and droughts. Key findings included that the transition
   of the societal value of water resources fitted the sigmoid curve - a
   conceptual S curve for the transition of social systems. Also, the
   transition of the societal value of water resources in Australia went
   through three stages: (1) pre-development (1900s-1962), when the
   societal value of water resources was dominated by economic development;
   (2) take-off (1963-1980), when the societal value of water resources
   reflected the increasing awareness of the environment due to the
   outbreak of pollution events; (3) acceleration (1981-2011), when the
   environment-oriented societal value of water resources combined with the
   Millennium Drought to trigger a package of policy initiatives and
   management practices focused on sustainable water resource use. The
   approach developed in this study, provides a roadmap for the development
   of new disciplines across social and natural science. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Title = {The past, present, and potential future of phosphorus management in the
   Florida Everglades},
Journal = {RESTORATION ECOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {31},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The Florida Everglades, the largest subtropical wetland in North
   America, is in the midst of one of the most comprehensive and expensive
   environmental restoration efforts in history. Over the past 150 years,
   the Everglades has suffered substantial degradation due to massive
   drainage projects, polluting agricultural practices, and urban
   population growth. Decades of scientific investigation have shown that
   phosphorus (P) pollution is a primary driver of this environmental
   decline. This paper reviews how and why specific P-management goals and
   strategies have been adopted in support of Everglades restoration,
   focusing on the often-contentious process for converting science into
   restoration policies and standards. We synthesize current P-management
   successes, failures, and tradeoffs, including the challenge of balancing
   multiple hydrologic and water quality restoration goals with the
   priorities and values of a diverse group of stakeholders. We then
   highlight promising future directions for Everglades P policy and
   propose questions to help guide the discussion of future restoration
   priorities and research needs in this and other complex
   social-ecological systems. The overall goals of this review are thus
   twofold: (1) to support an in-depth understanding of the past, present,
   and potential future of P management approaches in this globally unique
   social-ecological system; and (2) to provide a broader framework for
   understanding how the coevolution of science and policy can support or
   undermine large-scale ecosystem restoration.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL AGREEMENTS-POLITICS LAW AND ECONOMICS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {10},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {333-353},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The article introduces the notion of adaptiveness and discusses the role
   of social learning in it. Adaptiveness refers to the capacity of a
   social actor or social-ecological system to adapt in response to, or in
   anticipation of, changes in the environment. We explore arguments both
   from a theoretical perspective and through illustrations from case
   studies of water management in the Alps of Europe and Mekong in
   southeast Asia. We propose and illustrate that social learning processes
   are important for building adaptiveness in several ways and at different
   scales. Social learning can help cope with informational uncertainty;
   reduce normative uncertainty; build consensus on criteria for monitoring
   and evaluation; empower stakeholders to take adaptive actions; reduce
   conflicts and identify synergies between adaptations; and improve
   fairness of decisions and actions. Findings in the case studies provide
   some support for these generalizations but often with caveats related to
   diversity of stakeholder interests, levels of shared understanding
   versus contested knowledge and scale of coordination. For this reason,
   we suggest that future work pays greater attention to issues of agency,
   knowledge and scale: What strategies have individuals and organizations
   pursued in successful examples of social learning? How are the
   boundaries and interactions between science, policy and practice
   managed? How does social learning occur across spatial and temporal
   scales?},

Title = {Recreational fisheries in inland waters},
Booktitle = {FRESHWATER FISHERIES ECOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Pages = {449-465},
Abstract = {Recreational fisheries represent the dominant fisheries sector targeting
   wild freshwater fishes in all industrialized nations and are becoming
   increasingly popular in some emerging economies. The socio-economic
   benefits of recreational fisheries are numerous and substantial.
   Recreational fisheries through their practices (e.g. overharvest,
   habitat change, release mortality, stocking and dispersal of non-native
   fishes), however, have been implicated in negative effects on
   populations and ecosystems. In inland waters, fish populations also face
   a variety of threats that are external to the recreational fisheries
   sector such that recreational fisheries often operate on top of already
   imperilled resources. This chapter characterizes the scope and magnitude
   of inland recreational fisheries globally, explores recreational
   fisheries as a coupled social-ecological system, reviews management
   strategies, identifies the main issues faced by inland recreational
   fisheries and discusses the future of recreational fishing in inland
   waters with an emphasis on research and information needs to ensure
   their long-term sustainability.},

Abstract = {This study documents the event chronology and causes of land-use change
   in a deltaic region of the Philippines since the beginnings of
   aquaculture in the late nineteenth century. Satellite images and
   topographic maps spanning the period 1972-2013 were processed to map
   fishponds and the natural habitats over which they have encroached.
   Historical archives were consulted and interviews were conducted to
   understand the historical exploitation of local natural resources and
   the reasons behind the recorded land changes. Results showed that
   aquaculture developed in the late nineteenth century and expanded
   subsequently across the landscape under a succession of forcing factors.
   The global market, for example, played an early role but a number of
   land-use changes were also a direct response to changing environmental
   constraints and natural hazards. These cumulative events have promoted
   continuous gain in favor of aquaculture, to the detriment of other
   land-use options.},

Abstract = {The complex social-ecological systems network is an integrative platform
   of ecology, economy, management and complex networks which providing a
   new perspective on the comprehensive management of ecological and socio
   economical processes. Through research of the structures, functions and
   processes, one four-dimensional conceptual model of the complex
   social-ecological system for sustainable development was set up. The
   complex social-ecological systems comprise of natural subsystem, social
   subsystem, economic subsystem and integrative decision subsystem. The
   complex social-ecological systems network was defined as one six-element
   tuple which denotes the comprehensive spatial structure with different
   kinds of nodes of ecosystem, social system and economic system. The
   complex social-ecological systems network has some important
   characteristics including hierarchies, power-low, vulnerabilities,
   resilience, dynamics, co-evolution of flow and structure, et al. At
   last, based on the Multimedia Environment Pollutant Assessment System
   (MEPAS) of US EPA, the relationship between POPs (Persistent Organic
   Pollutants) exposure and lifetime fatal cancer risk was studied, and
   comprehensive risk network of the Taihu basin water pollution and human
   body health was established.},

Title = {Social Ecological Dynamics of Catchment Resilience},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {3},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Catchment resilience is the capacity of a combined social ecological
   system, comprised of water, land, ecological resources and communities
   in a river basin, to deal with sudden shocks and gradual changes, and to
   adapt and self-organize for progressive change and transform itself for
   sustainability. This paper proposes that analysis of catchments as
   social ecological systems can provide key insights into how social and
   ecological dynamics interact and how some of the negative consequences
   of unsustainable resource use or environmental degradation can be
   ameliorated. This requires recognition of the potential for community
   resilience as a core element of catchment resilience, and moves beyond
   more structural approaches to emphasize social dynamics. The proposals
   are based on a review of social ecological systems research, on methods
   for analyzing community resilience, and a review of social science and
   action research that suggest ways of generating resilience through
   community engagement. These methods and approaches maximize insights
   into the social dynamics of catchments as complex adaptive systems to
   inform science and practice.},

Journal = {SCIENCE ADVANCES},
Year = {2020},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Understanding the regime shifts of social-ecological systems (SES) and
   their local and spillover effects over a long time frame is important
   for future sustainability. We provide a perspective of processes
   unfolding over time to identify the regime shifts of a SES based on
   changes in the relationships between SES components while also
   addressing their drivers and local and spillover effects. The
   applicability of this approach has been demonstrated by analyzing the
   evolution over the past 1000 years of the SES in China's Loess Plateau
   (LP). Five evolutionary phases were identified: ``fast expansion of
   cultivation,{''} ``slow expansion of cultivation,{''} ``landscape
   engineering for higher production,{''} ``transition from cultivation to
   ecological conservation,{''} and ``revegetation for environment.{''} Our
   study establishes empirical links between the state (phase) of a SES to
   its drivers and effects. Lessons of single-goal driven and locally
   focused SES management in the LP, which did not consider these links,
   have important implications to long-term planning and policy formulation
   of SES.},

Abstract = {The problem of supporting decision-and policy-makers in managing issues
   related to solid waste and water quality was addressed within the
   context of a participatory modeling framework in the Sagarmatha National
   Park and Buffer Zone in Nepal. We present the main findings of
   management-oriented research projects conducted within this framework,
   thus providing an overview of the current situation in the park
   regarding solid waste and water quality issues. We found that most of
   the solid waste generated in the park is composed of organic matter,
   paper, and minor reused waste that is mainly reused for cattle feeding
   and manure, while disposal of other nondegradable categories of
   collected waste (glass, metal, and plastic) is not properly managed.
   Particularly, burning or disposal in open dumps poses a great hazard to
   environmental, human, and animal health, as most dump sites situated
   close to water courses are prone to regular flooding during the rainy
   season, thereby directly contaminating river water. Pollutants and
   microbiological contamination in water bodies were found and
   anthropogenic activities and hazardous practices such as solid waste
   dump sites, open defecation, and poor conditions of existing septic
   tanks are suggested as possibly affecting water quality. Collection of
   these data on solid waste and water quality and compilation of
   management information on the targeted social-ecological system allowed
   us to develop consensus-building models to be used as management
   supporting tools. By implementing such models, we were able to simulate
   scenarios identifying and evaluating possible management solutions and
   interventions in the park. This work reveals insights into general
   dynamics that can support the quest for solutions to waste and water
   quality management problems in other protected areas and mountain
   landscapes where traditional livelihood and land use patterns are
   changing under the influence of a growing population, changing
   consumption patterns, and international tourism.},

Abstract = {Carbon emissions in an industrialized world have created two problems
   for coral reefs: climate change and ocean acidification. Climate change
   drives ocean warming, which impacts biological and ecological reef
   processes, triggers large-scale coral bleaching events, and fuels
   tropical storms. Ocean acidification slows reef growth, alters
   competitive interactions, and impairs population replenishment. For
   managers and policymakers, ocean warming and acidification represent an
   almost paradoxical challenge by eroding reef resilience and
   simultaneously increasing the demand for reef resilience. Here, I
   address this problem in the context of challenges and potential
   solutions. Management efforts can compensate for reduced coral reef
   resilience in the face of global change, but to a limited extent and
   over a limited time frame. Critically, a realistic perspective on what
   sustainability measures can be achieved for coral reefs in the face of
   ocean warming and acidification is important to avoid setting
   unachievable goals for regional and local-scale management programs.},

Title = {Implementing Participatory Water Management: Recent Advances in Theory,
   Practice, and Evaluation},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {17},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Many current water planning and management problems are riddled with
   high levels of complexity, uncertainty, and conflict, so-called
   ``messes{''} or ``wicked problems.{''} The realization that there is a
   need to consider a wide variety of values, knowledge, and perspectives
   in a collaborative decision making process has led to a multitude of new
   methods and processes being proposed to aid water planning and
   management, which include participatory forms of modeling, planning, and
   decision aiding processes. However, despite extensive scientific
   discussions, scholars have largely been unable to provide satisfactory
   responses to two pivotal questions: (1) What are the benefits of using
   participatory approaches?; (2) How exactly should these approaches be
   implemented in complex social-ecological settings to realize these
   potential benefits? In the study of developing social-ecological system
   sustainability, the first two questions lead to a third one that extends
   beyond the one-time application of participatory approaches for water
   management: (3) How can participatory approaches be most appropriately
   used to encourage transition to more sustainable ecological, social, and
   political regimes in different cultural and spatial contexts? The answer
   to this question is equally open. This special feature on participatory
   water management attempts to propose responses to these three questions
   by outlining recent advances in theory, practice, and evaluation related
   to the implementation of participatory water management. The feature is
   largely based on an extensive range of case studies that have been
   implemented and analyzed by cross-disciplinary research teams in
   collaboration with practitioners, and in a number of cases in close
   cooperation with policy makers and other interested parties such as
   farmers, fishermen, environmentalists, and the wider public.},

Title = {Socio-Hydrological Approach for Water Resource Management and Human
   Well-Being in Pinglin District, Taiwan},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {18},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Despite being a limited resource, pollution, poor management, and other
   drivers like climate change make available water unsuitable and
   insufficient for human consumption and ecosystem maintenance. Therefore,
   a transdisciplinary approach is needed for managing this precious
   resource. The overall aim of this paper is to address water inequalities
   and improve human well-being using an integrated approach of key
   informant interviews, hydrological modeling, and the payment of
   ecosystem services (PES) scheme in Pinglin District, Taiwan. This site
   is an upstream area of Feicui Reservoir, which protects the downstream
   tap water supply. Key informant interviews were conducted to identify
   the gaps in and challenges to water resource management. This was
   followed by a scenario-based hydrological simulation using a Water
   Evaluation and Planning (WEAP) tool to project future water quality by
   the year 2050 (using biochemical oxygen demand and total coliform
   content as key indicator parameters) and to trace the factors
   responsible for water pollution. Survey analysis of key informant
   interviews depicts that this area is facing several challenges, such as
   lack of water infrastructure, agricultural subsidy, construction
   restrictions, etc., which cumulatively cause water scarcity in the
   upstream regions. On the other hand, hydrological simulation results
   show that population decline and climate change under an RCP 8.5
   scenario will have an enormous negative impact on water quality. The
   concentrations of BOD and E. coli in river water will expand by 110.1\%
   and 117.3\%, respectively, by 2050 compared to 2018. Finally, the
   results of the study suggest that the PES scheme can play a positive
   role in enabling integrated water resource management. For example
   construction of a small-scale wastewater treatment plant in the upstream
   area will reduce the total E. coli concentration by up to 90\%. While
   the initial cost of construction will be taken care of by the
   government, the operation and management cost of this infrastructure
   will be covered by people living downstream, who need to pay only \$0.10
   per year per person. The obtained results should be vital for both the
   stakeholders and decision-makers in this region.},

Title = {Assessing Action Situation Networks: A Configurational Perspective on
   Water and Energy Governance in Irrigation Systems},
Journal = {WATER ECONOMICS AND POLICY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {5},
Number = {1, SI},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The action situation is a core component of actor-centered institutional
   analysis of natural resource governance. Institutional analysis
   frameworks have been extended to observe multiple situations structured
   into networks. If further operationalized, this extension can improve
   policy diagnosis of human-environmental interactions. This paper
   proposes two complementary ways to move in that direction. First, we
   propose the use of qualitative configurational analysis and game theory
   to study the interactions between situations and assess the contribution
   of each to a desired outcome. Second, we draw on centrality measures to
   assess the benefits and risks of implementing policies that aim to
   change the equilibria in action situations. Both analytical strategies
   are applied to two cases involving irrigation and energy governance. In
   the Spanish case, centrality of the water allocation situation justifies
   a configuration of drought measures that also tackle cooperation in
   monitoring and infrastructure maintenance. In the Indian case,
   groundwater governance and adequate infrastructure capacity provision
   are necessary preconditions to enable coordinated technology adoption,
   which facilitates incentives for regulated irrigation. In both the
   cases, some action situations' positive outcomes are necessary in every
   configuration to guarantee optimal equilibria in the network. In the
   context of energy-fed irrigation systems, the proposed analytical
   strategies permit integrating interactions between water use, energy use
   and food production decisions in policy diagnoses. The analysis can be
   extended to identify archetypes, network closure, as well as structural
   and functional connectivity of networks in social-ecological systems.},

Abstract = {Rivers are social-ecological systems. Yet, in urban contexts, they have
   often been degraded to lifeless conduits, failing to promote
   human-nature interactions. As a countermeasure, river restoration has
   progressively been implemented globally to improve rivers' ecological
   quality and rejuvenate human-nature connections. In China, urban river
   restoration has been facilitated to improve river water quality and
   enhance nature-based recreation. Despite this nation-driven effort
   towards restoration, scholarly understanding of whether and how river
   restoration could align with societal preferences remains scarce. This
   study examined the social-ecological interactions associated with urban
   rivers with a social science methodology; a questionnaire survey was
   conducted at three Water Museums in three Chinese cities in summer 2022
   and collected 654 responses from highly educated respondents. The
   results revealed an appreciation for rivers' environmental and
   recreational value among urban residents, with childhood experiences
   playing a role in shaping these evaluations and perceptions. Respondents
   generally preferred prioritizing biological elements in urban river
   restoration. They also stress the importance of a balanced approach,
   integrating nature conservation and recreational functionality while
   maintaining physical water access. These findings challenge the current
   approach of urban river restoration in the three Chinese cities, which
   tend to emphasize aesthetic and recreational aspects over comprehensive
   ecological considerations. The ANCOVA analysis further indicated that
   preferences for river restoration are influenced by individuals'
   perceptions of the positive and negative social-ecological impacts of
   rivers, emphasizing the need to enhance environmental awareness
   regarding river ecosystems. Finally, in alignment with China's vision of
   promoting human-nature harmony, the study advocated for strategies that
   harmonize ecological functionality with societal needs in urban river
   management.},

Abstract = {Designing policies for the sustainable development of social-ecological
   systems with complex human-land relations requires integrated management
   and nexus thinking; China's national parks are typical social-ecological
   systems. Ecosystem services and community livelihood are two essential
   components of sustainable management in the nature-community nexus
   (NCN). This study focuses on the Qianjiangyuan National Park Pilot Area
   in eastern China. Following a systems approach and integrating
   qualitative (causal analysis and systems but dynamic methods) and
   quantitative (InVEST model, Spearman's correlation analysis, regression
   analysis, and multiple correspondence analysis) methods, we developed
   two causal mechanisms linking livelihood assets and ecosystem services,
   and verified them by exploring multi-dimensional linkages and revealing
   two types of NCNs. Results showed that the proportions of cropland and
   orchard areas have significant negative correlations with water and soil
   retention services, respectively, while forests significantly benefit
   both services. A positive NCN exists in areas where water and soil
   retention services perform well and the local community develops
   vibrantly with a considerable proportion of young, highly educated, or
   high-income (especially the income from secondary industries) residents.
   A negative NCN is seen in areas where the water and soil retention
   services values are low; a great many households do not have substantial
   income from secondary and tertiary industries, and few households have
   vast forest areas. These results can be used as scientific evidence for
   optimizing institutional arrangements and contributing to sustainable
   and harmonious development of national parks in China.},

Volume = {69},

Abstract = {Ecosystem services are a telling concept to discuss the integrated
   management of natural resources, such as integrated water and soil, with
   non-academic stakeholders. Stakeholders have different perceptions
   regarding the management of various ecosystem services, which is
   challenging when aiming to develop and foster sustainable ecosystem
   management. We performed a stakeholder analysis as part of a
   social-ecological study in preparation of a decision support system for
   integrated water management within the Lake Manyara sub-basin (LMSB),
   Tanzania. The area includes a National Park and UNESCO Biosphere
   Reserve. A group discussion listed 26 stakeholders, categorized
   according to the sector, influence, and interest. The stakeholders were
   grouped into six functional categories: local Non-Governmental
   Organisations (NGOs), other civil society groups, Belgian and
   international NGOs, authorities, academics associated to international
   donors and the private sector. We empirically identified advantages,
   shortcomings and associated risks when performing a stakeholder analysis
   with an interest-influence matrix. Confounding factors may include,
   e.g., the omission of important stakeholders, a different understanding
   of `influence' and `interest', or the omission of fragile groups.
   Instead of `low' or `high' interest and influence, we propose the terms
   `supportive', `potentially supportive', `unsupportive', `not
   interested', `low or no influence' and `antagonistic'. Further, we
   consider stakeholders who directly extract resources from the
   social-ecological system (SES) as a separate category, because of their
   direct dependence and impact on the SES. This improved stakeholder
   analysis framework for developing decision support systems in water
   basins can contribute to better analysis, understanding and management
   of aquatic social-ecological systems in general.},

Title = {Enhancing the Resilience of the Australian National Electricity Market:
   Taking a Systems Approach in Policy Development},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {16},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {As the complexity and interconnectedness of present-day
   social-ecological systems become steadily more apparent, there is
   increasing pressure on governments, policy makers, and managers to take
   a systems approach to the challenges facing humanity. However, how can
   this be done in the face of system complexity and uncertainties? In this
   paper we briefly discuss practical ways that policy makers can take up
   the systems challenge. We focus on resilience thinking, and the use of
   influence diagrams, causal-loop diagrams, and system archetypes. As a
   case study, set in the context of the climate-energy-water nexus, we use
   some of these system concepts and tools to carry out an initial
   exploration of factors that can affect the resilience of the Australian
   National Electricity Market. We stress the need for the electricity
   sector to prepare for the impacts of global change by encouraging
   innovation and diversity, supporting modularity and redundancy, and
   embracing the need for a policy making approach that takes account of
   the dynamics of the wider social-ecological system. Finally, taking a
   longer term view, we conclude by recommending that policy makers work to
   reduce reliance on conventional market mechanisms, institute continuing
   cross-sector dialogue, and promote basic education in system dynamics.},

Title = {Sustainable Development Scenarios in the Danube Delta-A Pilot
   Methodology for Decision Makers},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {21},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The Danube Delta, the second-largest wetland in Europe, provides people
   with multiple ecosystem services, consisting of drinking water, food,
   flood protection, nutrient recycling, and recreation, as it is a complex
   social-ecological system. Nowadays, the area faces heavy depopulation
   due to its failure in achieving an equilibrium between social, economic,
   and environmental issues. Therefore, its resurgence is the core element
   of its sustainable development strategy, and particular sectors such as
   fishing and aquaculture, agriculture, and tourism national strategies
   deal individually with essential issues without considering the
   potential conflicts that may arise from a particular sector's
   development. This study develops a complex method for decision making
   concerning the sustainable development of the Danube Delta Biosphere
   Reserve based on the consultation of both local and higher-level
   stakeholders in decision making, and the identification of social,
   economic, and environmental key problems. After their validation by
   experts, we developed a system dynamics model and ran the identified
   scenarios together with the stakeholders and recommended policies for
   the sustainable development of the area. The scenario that combines the
   transition towards the moderate Intensification of aquaculture with
   ecological agriculture and slow tourism brings a reduced impact on water
   quality, but measures to reduce nutrients are still recommended.},

Title = {An integrated approach to valuation and tradeoff analysis of ecosystem

Journal = {ECOSYSTEM SERVICES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {33},
Number = {A},
Pages = {1-18},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {An integrated approach to understanding ecosystem service values in
   Wyoming and Montana, USA is presented. The assessment encompasses a
   major river basin, and includes a synthesis of existing data and
   research related to the natural system and separate data collection
   efforts regarding the social and economic importance of ecosystem
   services. A holistic look at the social-ecological system provides
   nuanced information about ecosystem service values and tradeoffs for the
   purpose of public land decision-making.
   The initial ecological assessment concluded that water resources were
   particularly vulnerable, which guided the social and economic
   assessments. The social assessment applied Q-methodology, ultimately
   identifying and exploring four archetypes regarding views on the
   importance of 34 ecosystem services, which were dubbed
   ``environmental{''}, ``agricultural{''}, ``Native American{''}, and
   ``recreation{''}. The economic assessment applied choice modeling to
   understand non-market values of ecosystem services (i.e., agricultural
   community, aquatic biodiversity, river angling, and motorized winter
   recreation), and latent class analysis provided insight into preference
   heterogeneity previously indicated in the social assessment. The
   structured approach can inform natural resource decision-making by
   including several different perspectives, integrating multiple spatial
   scales, highlighting particular ecosystem services as relevant within
   the context of many ecosystem services, and facilitating relations
   between the public and natural resource stewards.},

Title = {Social-ecological Resilience Modeling: Water Stress Effects in the
   Bighorn Sheep Management System in Baja California Sur, Mexico},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL COMPLEXITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {45},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) management involves ecological and
   socioeconomic aspects, creating a social-ecological system (SES).
   Social-ecological thresholds can be identified in the system to assess
   its specific resil-ience in response to climate stressors. Thus, the aim
   of this study is to build a dynamic model to assess whether this system
   is resilient to a particular stressor (water stress). In this study, the
   SES is considered resilient if the bighorn population is sufficiently
   large to provide economic revenue to landowners and promote conservation
   action. We validate and formalize this model by conducting
   semistructured interviews to Bonfil ejido landowners located in Baja
   California Sur (BCS), Mexico, and to experts in the field of
   recreational hunting and wildlife management. To explore the changes in
   specific resilience in this SES, we conduct simulations to assess the
   impact of rainfall variability patterns on the system. Our results
   indicate that rainfall variations with respect to the historical record
   have the potential to disrupt both the species and the local economy and
   that the lack of adaptive capacity in both harvest and conservation
   strategies may affect the dynamics of the whole SES. Finally, this paper
   explores how adaptive wildlife conservation management strategies can
   enhance the resilience of both subsystems in this SES.},

Year = {2014},
Volume = {83},
Number = {2},
Pages = {383-386},
Month = {JUN 30},
Abstract = {Seagrass meadows are valuable ecosystem service providers that are now
   being lost globally at an unprecedented rate, with water quality and
   other localised stressors putting their future viability in doubt. It is
   therefore critical that we learn more about the interactions between
   seagrass meadows and future environmental change in the anthropocene.
   This needs to be with particular reference to the consequences of poor
   water quality on ecosystem resilience and the effects of change on
   trophic interactions within the food web. Understanding and predicting
   the response of seagrass meadows to future environmental change requires
   an understanding of the natural long-term drivers of change and how
   these are currently influenced by anthropogenic stress. Conservation
   management of coastal and marine ecosystems now and in the future
   requires increased knowledge of how seagrass meadows respond to
   environmental change, and how they can be managed to be resilient to
   these changes. Finding solutions to such issues also requires
   recognising people as part of the social-ecological system. This special
   issue aims to further enhance this knowledge by bringing together global
   expertise across this field. The special issues considers issues such as
   ecosystem service delivery of seagrass meadows, the drivers of long-term
   seagrass change and the socio-economic consequences of environmental
   change to seagrass. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Title = {Trade-offs in adapting to changes in climate, land use, and water
   availability in California},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {28},
Number = {4},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {. Changes in land use and land cover, water systems, and climate are
   inextricably linked, and their combined stresses have had severe impacts
   in many regions worldwide. Integrated adaptation planning can support
   adaptive capacity by helping institutions manage land and water
   resources at regional to local scales. Linkages between these stressors
   mean that planners are often faced with potential trade-offs, and how to
   couple social and environmental sustainability remains a key question.
   We explore these questions in California's Central Coast, a region that
   is already experiencing serious water shortages, housing shortages,
   rapid expansion of perennial agriculture, and severe droughts that are
   projected to become worse with climate change. Linked models of land use
   change (the Land Use and Carbon + Water Simulator {[}LUCAS-W]), water
   resources (LUCAS-W), and climate (the Basin Characterization Model
   {[}BCM]) produced forecasts of exposure to regional changes at 270-m
   resolution. We worked with regional stakeholders to develop a matrix of
   nine vulnerability measures that assessed key sensitivities to these
   changes. Each vulnerability measure combined one of the three exposure
   projections with spatial datasets representing one of three sensitivity
   communities (agricultural, domestic, or ecological). We assessed how
   five scenarios of land-use and water management strategies under
   consideration by regional planners could provide institutional, top-down
   adaptive capacity, and whether there were trade-offs in sustainable
   development goals for these communities. We found that specific land and
   water management strategies could greatly reduce regional vulnerability,
   particularly programs to cap water extractions to sustainable levels.
   The most dramatic trade-off was between the strategy of water demand
   caps that increased risk of habitat loss and ecosystem preservation that
   increased water vulnerability. However, trade-offs were usually limited
   and spatially localized, suggesting local tailoring of the strategies we
   assessed could reduce them. Trade-offs were more frequent across
   exposure classes (land use vs. water vs. climate changes) rather than
   sensitivity classes (agricultural vs. domestic vs. ecological
   communities), suggesting win-win opportunities for natural resource
   management. Our vulnerability maps can inform prioritization efforts for
   local adaptation planning.},

Title = {`We're managing a different river now': a political ecology of

Abstract = {The Dolores River is fed primarily by snowmelt from the western San Juan
   Mountains in southwestern Colorado. It travels 241 miles across the
   Colorado Plateau to its confluence with the Colorado River, near Moab,
   Utah, a major nature-based tourism destination in the U.S west. Water
   usage and climate change projections in the Dolores River Watershed, as
   well as throughout the Colorado River Basin, complicate transboundary
   planning and management related to vital ecosystem services. As dynamic
   pressures alter this complex social-ecological system, disparities in
   resource allocation are magnified. In this study, we leverage
   reflections from recreation, conservation, and land management
   stakeholders (n = 18) to understand their perceptions of water
   allocation within the Dolores River Watershed. We frame this
   conversation using Rawls's (A theory of justice. Harvard University
   Press; JSTOR, 1971) theory of justice to explore perceived
   incompatibilities present within the existing watershed management and
   discuss recreational and environmental stakeholders' perceptions of the
   inequitable distribution of resources. A combination of deductive coding
   processes using Rawls's principles and inductive open coding processes
   help identify linkages between the Rawlsian framework and interviewees'
   experiences of the salient political ecologies of the watershed. We
   conclude by illustrating challenges with the current water regime within
   the Dolores River Watershed and potential improvements to the
   distribution of resources through policy and management consistent with
   Rawls's theory of justice.},

Title = {People-Centric Nature-Based Land Restoration Through Agroforestry: A
   Typology},
Journal = {LAND},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {9},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Restoration depends on purpose and context. At the core it entails
   innovation to halt ongoing and reverse past degradation. It aims for
   increased functionality, not necessarily recovering past system states.
   Location-specific interventions in social-ecological systems reducing
   proximate pressures, need to synergize with transforming generic drivers
   of unsustainable land use. After reviewing pantropical international
   research on forests, trees, and agroforestry, we developed an
   options-by-context typology. Four intensities of land restoration
   interact: R.I. Ecological intensification within a land use system,
   R.II. Recovery/regeneration, within a local social-ecological system,
   R.III. Reparation/recuperation, requiring a national policy context,
   R.IV. Remediation, requiring international support and investment.
   Relevant interventions start from core values of human identity while
   addressing five potential bottlenecks: Rights, Know-how, Markets
   (inputs, outputs, credit), Local Ecosystem Services (including water,
   agrobiodiversity, micro/mesoclimate) and Teleconnections (global climate
   change, biodiversity). Six stages of forest transition (from closed
   old-growth forest to open-field agriculture and re-treed (peri)urban
   landscapes) can contextualize interventions, with six special places:
   water towers, riparian zone and wetlands, peat landscapes, small islands
   and mangroves, transport infrastructure, and mining scars. The typology
   can help to link knowledge with action in people-centric restoration in
   which external stakeholders coinvest, reflecting shared responsibility
   for historical degradation and benefits from environmental stewardship.},

Abstract = {Over the past 50 years, both financing and socioeconomic considerations
   in South India have shifted heavily towards improving urban
   infrastructure, causing rural services to be left behind. A recent
   report released by WHO and UNICEF states that over 884 million people,
   84\% of whom live in rural areas, use ``unimproved water sources{''} for
   domestic purposes. This paper considers the case study of Nalgonda, a
   district to the east of Hyderabad, India. Nalgonda struggles with three
   main issues concerning domestic water: high fluoride levels in
   groundwater have caused thousands of cases of dental and skeletal
   fluorosis; second, over two-thirds of Nalgonda does not meet the
   WHO-requirement of 40 liters per capita daily of domestic water supply;
   third, poor management and maintenance have increased the risk of
   failure of existing water infrastructure. The state has been pursuing
   these issues in conjunction with a multi-district irrigation project
   that taps the regional Nagarjuna Sagar Dam. Centralized water supply,
   treatment, and distribution services are appropriate for high population
   density areas; however, geographical expanse and sparse populations lead
   to onerous access to improved water sources and inhibit the success of a
   similar centralized framework in rural areas. This is compounded by a
   lack of ownership at the habitation and socio-cultural levels. Further,
   the current water network and its problems-including inconsistent
   service, corruption, and general distrust of the treated Sagar
   water-have emboldened wealthier citizens to build private, unregulated
   groundwater defluoridation plants and commercialize small-scale water
   businesses.
   Inequitable services and uncertainty of shared water resources have
   caused a ``tragedy of the commons,{''} leading to growing disparity and
   a severely receding water table. This research proposes the Louis-Ostrom
   Comprehensive Capacity Assessment (LOCCA) tool-an integration of the
   quantitative Capacity Factors Analysis risk methodology and the
   qualitative Ostrom's framework for assessing socio-ecological systems
   (SESs). The new framework is used to provide a sample assessment of the
   Vaillapally habitation in Narayanpur Mandal, Nalgonda. Preliminary
   results indicate that the institutional, technical, and socio-cultural
   capacity factors must progress to meet the policymakers' current
   projects technical capacity. Alternatively, decentralized systems, such
   as rainwater harvesting technology, better serve rural areas with low
   capacity and demand, while increasing collective investment in
   village-scale systems.},

Title = {Transboundary resilience: the case of social-hydrological systems facing

Pages = {829-846},
Note = {23rd SRA-Europe Annual Meeting on Analysis and Governance of Risks

Abstract = {Transboundary Risk' and its management are widely acknowledged concepts,
   real-world problems and policy challenges preoccupying the fields of
   geography, sociology, political science, management and disaster
   studies. Up to the present, the notion of boundary' in the study and
   management of transboundary risks principally refers to national
   borders, whereas other important boundaries, such as the physical
   boundaries of drainage basins, the boundaries of social-ecological
   systems (SESs) or the lines separating public from private space, are
   rarely considered with respect to their penetration by risk dynamics.
   Resilience has been acknowledged in the case of SESs as an operation
   appealing to various spatial and temporal scales for access to vital
   resources. However, the spatio-temporal boundaries which are surpassed
   or penetrated in the process of transition from one scale to another is
   an unexplored issue. The authors focus their attention on a specific
   type of SESs, the social-hydrological systems (SHSs), facing the stress
   (risk) of water scarcity or drought, and assume that resilience of SHSs
   may be a process of attraction of water resources from other, probably
   distant SHSs. This type of resilience which transfers vulnerability
   might be termed trans-boundary resilience because it necessitates the
   breaking of boundaries and the spatial transformation of SHSs. This view
   considers resilience as a transboundary and trans-scalar dynamic process
   facilitating resource transfer and unveils its spatial dimension as well
   as its ethical and normative aspects. These assumptions are empirically
   confirmed in a range of water scarcity and drought problems, which are
   the following: (a) cities relying on water transfer from distant river
   basins; (b) agricultural populations and holdings facing drought and
   relying on a shared aquifer; and (c) arid islands. Whether this type of
   resilience is valid in other SES cases and other types of risk, is a
   matter of future research.},

   ecological restoration project success},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {20},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {We look to a particular social-ecological system, the restoration
   community in Rhode Island, USA and the rivers, wetlands, marshes, and
   estuaries they work to protect, to draw connections between
   communication, community involvement, and ecological restoration project
   success. Offering real-world examples drawn from interviews with 27
   local, state, federal, and nonprofit restoration managers, we synthesize
   the mechanisms that managers found effective to argue that the
   communication employed by resource managers in each phase of the
   restoration process, in prioritization, implementation, and monitoring,
   and for garnering broad-based support, shapes the quality of public
   engagement in natural resources management, which, in turn, can impact
   the stakeholder, learning, and ecological success of restoration
   projects. Despite the possible trade-offs and conflicts between social
   and ecological outcomes, we suggest that managers need to consider their
   desired social-ecological outcomes and work from the outset to
   deliberately design mechanisms for communication and public engagement
   that weave community stakeholders into all phases of restoration
   projects in sustained and consequential ways.},

Journal = {CURRENT OPINION IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {48},
Pages = {125-131},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The Northern Great Plains (NGP) region plays a very important role in
   providing water and land resources and other critical ecosystem services
   to support rural livelihoods. Semi-arid conditions and the tight
   coupling of livelihood enterprises with ecosystem services increases
   sensitivity to climate change. The changing climate and social-economic
   situations across the NGP have further challenged current management
   practices. Recent climate stresses has indicated that changing
   seasonality and extreme events (e.g., droughts, floods, ice storms) are
   impacting ecosystem services and increasing vulnerability to rural
   livelihoods. In particular, the emergence of rapid on-set of drought has
   been problematic to resource managers and operators due the shortened
   period to respond to these drought events. This paper provides a
   regional example for the North American Great Plains to illustrate how
   emerging climate impacts affect the ability to respond within the
   social-ecological system capabilities to manage for these impacts. This
   paper is a contribution to an international effort, the Global Dryland
   Ecosystem Programme (Fu et al. this issue), to develop regional research
   and engagement efforts to further understand the impacts of climate
   change on ecosystem processes and to enable this knowledge to guide
   further development of adaptive management options.},

Abstract = {The uncertainty associated with the definition of strategies for climate
   change adaptation poses a challenge that cannot be faced by science
   alone. We present a participatory experience where, instead of having
   science defining solutions and eliciting stakeholders' feedback, local
   actors actually drove the process. While principles and methods of the
   approach are easily adaptable to different local contexts, this paper
   shows the contribution of participatory dynamics to the design of
   adaptation measures in the biodiversity-rich socio-ecological region
   surrounding the Donana wetlands (Southern Spain). During the process,
   stakeholders and scientists collaboratively designed a common scenario
   for the future in which to define and assess a portfolio of potential
   adaptation measures, and found a safe, informal space for open dialogue
   and information exchange. Through this dialogue, points of connection
   among local actors emerged around the need for more integrated,
   transparent design of adaptation measures; for strengthening local
   capacity; and for strategies to diversify economic activities in order
   to increase the resilience of the region. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {We use the hybrid modeling laboratory of the Mediterranean Landscape
   Dynamics (MedLanD) Project to simulate barranco incision in eastern
   Spain under different scenarios of natural and human environmental
   change. We carry out a series of modeling experiments set in the Rio
   Penaguila valley of northern Alicante Province. The MedLanD Modeling
   Laboratory (MML) is able to realistically simulate gullying and incision
   in a multi-dimensional, spatially explicit virtual landscape. We first
   compare erosion modeled in wooded and denuded landscapes in the absence
   of human land-use. We then introduce simulated small-holder (e.g.,
   prehistoric Neolithic) farmer/herders in six experiments, by varying
   community size (small, medium, large) and land management strategy
   (satisficing and maximizing). We compare the amount and location of
   erosion under natural and anthropogenic conditions. Natural (e.g.,
   climatically induced) land-cover change produces a distinctly different
   signature of landscape evolution than does land-cover change produced by
   agropastoral land-use. Human land-use induces increased coupling between
   hillslopes and channels, resulting in increased downstream incision.},

Volume = {5},

Pages = {388-409},
Abstract = {Collaborative natural resource management institutions enable agents
   with diverse interests to come together to solve complex problems. These
   actors must overcome a series of collective action problems to create,
   maintain, and evolve these institutions. In addition to the challenge of
   heterogeneous actors, these commons social-ecological systems often face
   internal and external threats or disturbances. The institutional
   arrangements may be effective with problems that are internal to a
   social-ecological system - ones that they are designed to handle, but
   how do these arrangements cope with external disturbances, especially
   ones caused by large-scale political and economic decisions, events, and
   processes. Using ethnographic and archival data we conduct an
   institutional analysis outlining the existing and emerging
   collaboratives, the important actors, and ongoing efforts to cope with
   the five major challenges identified by rangeland actors. We trace the
   evolution of institutions on the western range with a focus on their
   ability to cope with challenges that are largely within the system -
   biodiversity, fire, and water management, and those that are driven
   externally by actors who are largely absent - border militarization and
   violence and exurbanization.},

Title = {Factors Influencing Small-Scale Fishers' Individual Perceived Wellbeing
   Satisfaction in Southern Benin},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {11},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In southern Benin, the rapid growth of demographics and the need for
   fishery products have forced public managers to adopt various management
   measures in the face of anti-ecological methods used by fishers;
   however, these strategies are often formulated independent from the
   context. These measures have not remained without consequence on the
   daily lives of fishers. This paper examines factors influencing fishers'
   individual perceived wellbeing satisfaction using the social-ecological
   system framework. Data on 205 small-scale fishers' demographic
   information, perception of job, and individual wellbeing satisfaction
   and governance subsystems were collected and analysed by the use of an
   ordered logistic regression. The results demonstrate that job
   satisfaction and ownership of water bodies (in contradiction to Ostrom's
   advocation for commons management) affected fishers' individual
   perceived wellbeing satisfaction. Fishers likely value ownerships,
   affecting their perceived wellbeing mainly in the South East. The
   prohibition of certain fishing gear decreases fishers' individual
   perceived wellbeing, indicating their attachment to these. Therefore,
   the question remains as to whether or not the scenarios of
   eco-sustainability of artisanal fisheries can be managed in the same
   manner as those related urban dwellers and the public sector. This is in
   particular reference to the line between urban land property rights,
   urban dwellers and the state, and property rights on water bodies,
   fishers, and the state.},

   Xochimilco, Mexico},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {24},
Number = {3},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {We explore how loss of livelihood, loss of ecological function, and loss
   of group identity are linked in the process of social-ecological change
   through the narratives of stakeholders associated with the wetland of
   Xochimilco in Mexico City. Drawing from interviews, focus groups, and
   participatory workshops with a variety of residents and city
   administrators, we analyze narratives about what is valued, what is
   problematized, and what social and ecological relationships appear as
   critical from the perspective of contemporary residents and officials.
   Loss is prominent in these narratives, capturing the interdependence of
   ecology, identity, meaning, and livelihood for the inhabitants. We trace
   these narratives to the historical roots of center-periphery politics of
   land and water use, situating the current dynamic context within the
   social-ecological system's long pathway of change. Diffuse blame for
   social-ecological change expressed in the narratives appears to inhibit
   collective action, as does a conflicted history of local response to the
   city's control of resources. We posit that finding a sustainable pathway
   forward may depend in part on how residents are able to cognitively or
   emotionally accommodate landscape change while still enabling the values
   they have come to associate with the landscape. Such accommodation may
   entail accepting some degree of loss in system function and structure,
   but this loss may also provide opportunities for new social-ecological
   relations that enable the persistence of local identity.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {124},
Pages = {604-615},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Multiple societal challenges such as climate change, water pollution and
   biodiversity loss require coordinated measures. Thereby the adoption of
   a nexus perspective is expedient. It acknowledges relationships between
   natural and social entities, and takes synergies and trade-offs of
   planned and implemented measures into account. We adopt a nexus
   perspective to elicit sectoral stakeholders' perceptions on the
   relationships of the regional nexus entities, relevant measures and
   their perceived synergies and trade-offs in the semi-arid agricultural
   production region Seewinkel in East Austria. In a multi-step cognitive
   mapping approach, consisting of a workshop and semi-structured
   interviews, we developed an aggregated cognitive map with perceptions of
   stakeholders from agriculture, water management, nature conservation,
   tourism, the civil society, renewable energy and hunting. Workshop and
   interview transcripts were analyzed by means of a qualitative content
   analysis. Stakeholders agree on the priority of a good quantitative and
   chemical status of the regional groundwater body and a location-adapted
   agricultural production. They propose a combination of market-based,
   legal and technical measures supported by cross-sectoral institutions in
   responding to regional nexus challenges. Stakeholders perceive divergent
   synergies and trade-offs. Perceived synergies may provide opportunities,
   which have not yet been considered for planning of measures. Perceived
   trade-offs require further examination and cross-sectoral discussion to
   encourage the implementation of measures. The aggregated cognitive map
   may improve stakeholders' understanding for nexus relationships and
   facilitate social learning through viewing the interlinked nexus from
   distance and different perspectives. This may facilitate cross-sectoral
   dialogue and enable collective decision making to tackle regional nexus
   challenges.},

   Salmon in the Kenai River Watershed, Alaska},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Environmental changes caused by climate change in Alaska pose a serious
   threat to the food, energy and water systems that support the culturally
   diverse communities statewide. The fishing industry, watershed managers
   and other stakeholders struggle with understanding and predicting the
   rates, magnitude and location of changes occurring in their regions
   primarily because of the significant range of uncertainty inherent in
   these changes. With the guidance of stakeholders, we demonstrate a
   scenario analysis methodology to elucidate the interactions among
   various components and uncertainties within the food, energy and water
   systems of the Kenai River Watershed. Alternative scenario analysis
   provided stakeholders with a venue and process to consider plausible
   futures in which rates of change in critical uncertainties were modeled
   to elucidate potential responses. Critical uncertainties ranged from
   climatic impacts on freshwater systems, to new energy development
   proposals, to changes in sport and personal use fisheries. Working
   together, stakeholders developed narratives that reflected different
   combinations of future uncertainty to guide potential management actions
   now and in the future. Five scenarios were developed by stakeholders
   that capture the complex interactions in the Kenai River Watershed as a
   social-ecological system. This process provides a way for managers and
   stakeholders to plan for the future in a richer way than extrapolating
   trends for obvious drivers of change. We present this framework as a
   platform for integrating climate, landscape and cultural change data
   into actionable decisions, crafted by stakeholders, to improve future
   food, energy and water resource management at the watershed scale.},

Title = {The nexus social-ecological system framework (NexSESF): A conceptual and

Abstract = {Over the past decade, debates on the governance of food, water, and
   energy resources (FWE nexus) have increased, provoking new insights into
   social importance in ecological balance. Policymakers, management
   professionals, and scholars of the FWE nexus call for new approaches
   that address ranges of social and ecological impacts of uncoordinated
   sectoral planning. From a theoretical perspective, social-ecological
   systems (SES) science offers a balanced approach for improved FWE nexus
   through consolidating knowledge from a wide range of disciplines and
   providing the opportunity to adapt to the changing environment. However,
   although increasingly employed, it has been complicated to empirically
   monitor and evaluate the dynamic social ecological nexus systems. A
   framework for translating SES theory into FWE nexus practice is needed.
   This paper develops an integrated assessment framework of the
   social-ecological nexus systems governance and presents results from its
   application to a Dutch smart-eco city. An integrative multi-level
   analysis scheme is used to analyze intra-and inter-relationships,
   quantify social and ecological impacts of uncoordinated FWE management,
   and visualize FWE supply-chain risks posed to cities by the dynamic
   humans and nature interactions. The evidence-based approach of this
   study proved advantages of the proposed framework in (i) revealing
   connections of natural resources and the cultural, regulating, and
   supporting services of nexus systems, and (ii) making practical
   recommendations for improved socio-ecologically-balanced nexus
   interventions. The results can support policymakers and management
   professionals of the FWE nexus to organize their analytical, diagnostic,
   and prescriptive capabilities to make development decisions on urban
   resilience and ecological balance.},

Title = {River Ecosystem Resilience: Applying the Contingent Valuation Method in
   Vietnam},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {19},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Mine water drainage interferes with ecosystems of the discharging river,
   whilst river ecosystem services in return affect the livelihoods and
   well-being of adjacent communities. In Ha Long, Vietnam, surface coal
   mining will be closed after 2025 following the national and provincial
   strategy toward sustainable development. This opens up an opportunity to
   rehabilitate the associated rivers to increase resilience in the
   surrounding social-ecological system (SES) heavily affected by water
   pollution from coal mines. Increasing resilience through rehabilitation
   is costly and policy makers often lack precise enough information on
   public benefits to make good decisions. In this study, we apply the
   concept of SESs to analyze the interrelationship between river
   ecosystems and human society with its institutions and local governance
   surrounding the Ha Long coal mining area. Applying a contingent
   valuation survey with 410 households living near to the mining
   operations, we assess the public benefits resulting from three different
   but partly combined projects to increase resilience. Results show that
   households are significantly willing to contribute to all proposed
   resilience increasing projects. Factors explaining willingness to pay
   (WTP) are diverse and are found to be related to common institutions and
   local governance. Through a comparison of the results for the three
   projects, we find the presence of embedding effects and identify factors
   leading to upward biased estimates of WTP. Our study contributes to a
   better understanding and valuation of public benefits in SES necessary
   for public policy towards increasing resilience in developing countries.},

Title = {Biophysical and sociocultural factors underlying spatial trade-offs of
   ecosystem services in semiarid watersheds},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {20},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {Biophysical and social systems are linked to form social-ecological
   systems whose sustainability depends on their capacity to absorb
   uncertainty and cope with disturbances. In this study, we explored the
   key biophysical and socio-cultural factors underlying ecosystem service
   supply in two semiarid watersheds of southern Spain. These included
   variables associated with the role that freshwater flows and
   biodiversity play in securing the system's capacity to sustain essential
   ecosystem services and their relationship with social demand for
   services, local water governance, and land-use intensification. Our
   results reveal the importance of considering the invisible dimensions of
   water and biodiversity, i.e. green freshwater flows and trait-based
   indicators, because of their relevance to the supply of ecosystem
   services. Furthermore, they uncover the importance of traditional
   irrigation canals, a local water governance system, in maintaining the
   ecosystems' capacity to supply services. The study also highlights the
   complex trade-offs that occur because of the spatial mismatch between
   ecosystem service supply (upstream) and ecosystem service demand
   (downstream) in watersheds. Finally, we found that land-use
   intensification generally resulted in losses of the biophysical factors
   that underpin the supply of some ecosystem services, increases in social
   demand for less diversified services, and the abandonment of local
   governance practices. Attempts to manage social-ecological systems
   toward sustainability at the local scale should identify the key
   biophysical and socio-cultural factors that are essential for
   maintaining ecosystem services and should recognize existing
   interrelationships between them. Land-use management should also take
   into account ecosystem service trade-offs and the consequences resulting
   from land-use intensification.},

Title = {Purposeful Stakeholder Engagement for Improved Environmental Flow
   Outcomes},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Month = {JAN 25},
Abstract = {Rivers are dynamic social-ecological systems that support societies and
   ecosystems in a multitude of ways, giving rise to a variety of user
   groups and competing interests. Environmental flows (e-flows) programs
   developed to protect riverine environments are often conceived by water
   managers and researchers. This is despite continued calls for increased
   public participation to include local communities and Indigenous peoples
   in the development process. Failure to do so undermines social
   legitimacy and program effectiveness. In this paper, we describe how
   adaptive management of e-flows allows an opportunity to incorporate a
   diversity of stakeholder views through an iterative process. However, to
   achieve this, stakeholder engagement must be intentionally integrated
   into the adaptive management cycle. Stakeholder engagement in e-flows
   allows for the creation of a shared understanding of a river and opens
   collaborative and innovative management strategies that address multiple
   axes of uncertainty. Here, we describe a holistic framework that unifies
   current participatory engagement attempts and existing technical methods
   into a complete strategy. The framework identifies the primary steps in
   an e-flows adaptive management cycle, describes potential roles of
   various stakeholders, and proposes potential engagement tools.
   Restructuring e-flows methods to adequately include stakeholders
   requires a shift from being driven by deliverables, such as reports and
   flow recommendations, to focusing on people-oriented outcomes, such as
   continuous learning and fostering relationships. While our work has been
   placed in the context of e-flows, the intentional integration of
   stakeholder engagement in adaptive management is pertinent to natural
   resources management generally.},

Abstract = {The Columbia River Basin is a complex social-ecological system, spanning
   political, legal, socio-economic, geographic, and biophysical
   boundaries. Outreach to others in social networks develops fundamental
   communications needed for sustainable collaborations in adaptive
   management. However, operationalizing and comparing measures of social
   processes and outcome success in biophysical indicators remains
   challenging for resource managers. Using survey-based research, we
   examined the interactions for water resource governance of five Columbia
   River reservoir basins in the northwestern US and Canada: Lakes Chelan,
   Roosevelt, Pend Oreille, Koocanusa, and clq'etkw (Flathead). Respondents
   included: water resource professionals working for Tribes/First Nations,
   federal, state, or provincial departments in water quality and/or
   fisheries, and people who engage in the networks on behalf of area
   businesses, government offices, public services, non-profit
   organizations, and other entities. Perceived social process metrics in
   these governance networks included the levels of collaboration and
   inclusiveness, common goals, common strategies, identifying issues,
   implementing action, and the adequacy of available scientific data. We
   evaluated social measures relative to participant-reported changes in
   physical lake health indicators. Qualitative data-enhanced understanding
   of basin-specific differences. Correlations of social by ecological
   measures varied widely between basins. Even moderate to strong
   functionality parameters did not scale well from individual to
   cross-basin levels, as many correlations vanished with data aggregated.
   However, data analysis at the basin scale revealed important variability
   across the region in scope and governance functionality. Process
   indicators such as identifying issues and implementing action yielded
   stronger relationships for 10-year horizons than for 2 years, reflecting
   the lag-time in resource action.},

Title = {Compelling collective action: Does a shared pollution cap incentivize
   farmer cooperation to restore water quality?},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE COMMONS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {378-399},
Abstract = {Decades of voluntary efforts to reduce agricultural nonpoint source
   pollution have been ineffective at protecting water quality worldwide.
   While farmer collective action is needed to deal with the geographical
   extent of diffuse pollution from nutrient runoff, theoretical
   expectations from commons governance research predicts that farmers will
   not protect water quality since they have few incentives to do so. These
   different factors indicate that compulsory approaches are needed.
   However, the commons literature has tended to overlook the constructive
   roles that government regulation can play. Research on why farmers adopt
   on-farm conservation measures similarly has failed to explore farmer
   cooperation, instead focusing mainly on financial motivations of
   farmers. Yet, some adoption research indicates that social norms are
   essential factors shaping (non) adoption, but which are largely
   overlooked by existing agri-environmental policies. This study examines
   the important gap of how government regulations can incentivise
   farmer-cooperation to improve water quality. I focus on a case study of
   the Florida Everglades, where farmers face joint liability under a
   phosphorus pollution cap and which has resulted in improvements in water
   quality over the past 20 years. Farms' drainage disrupts the
   oligotrophic conditions of the Florida Everglades, but water quality has
   steadily improved since regulations began in 1994. However, the
   regulations set compliance jointly for farmers, devolving responsibility
   to ensure sufficient adoption of conservation practices and deal with
   free riding. While state monitoring shows that collectively farms have
   improved water quality, we do not know whether participation is
   widespread or concentrated among a few large farms. This study provides
   the first analysis of farm-level water quality outcomes for this area
   and how judicial, legislative, and local institutions interact to
   encourage farmer cooperation. Results show that a large majority of
   farms have improved their water quality, demonstrating that collective
   action has been a key element in the outcome. At the same time,
   poor-performing farms reveal the shortcomings of joint compliance. I end
   by discussing the implications of how individual and collective
   requirements can provide farmers with valuable information while also
   drawing on farmer social dynamics to encourage greater participation.},

Title = {Perspectives on Climate Change, Mountain Hydrology, and Water Resources
   in the Oregon Cascades, USA},
Journal = {MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {32},
Number = {1},
Pages = {S35-S46},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {From both social and environmental perspectives, water is the main
   connection between highland and lowland processes in mountain
   watersheds: Water flows downhill while human impacts flow uphill. For
   example, in the Oregon Cascades mountain range, geology, vegetation, and
   climate influence the hydrologic connections within watersheds. Geology
   determines which watersheds are surface runoff-dominated and which are
   groundwater-dominated. In this Mediterranean climate with dry summers,
   surface runoff watersheds will consistently experience near-zero late
   summer discharge, so declining snowpacks will have little effect on low
   flows. This contrasts with groundwater-dominated watersheds, where a
   shift from snow to rain or a decline in precipitation will reduce
   recharge, thereby reducing late summer groundwater contributions to
   streamflow. Earlier snowmelt causes forests to transpire earlier,
   resulting in decreased springtime streamflow. Reduced snowpacks lead to
   soil moisture stress, making forests more vulnerable to extensive
   wildfires and affecting the lifespan and composition of forests.
   Monitoring and quantifying these complex linkages and feedbacks require
   appropriate measurement networks. Sampling strategies often use
   watershed typology to identify where measurements should be focused.
   Such an approach should include not only established watershed
   classification parameters such as topology and geology but also
   interannual climate variability and land cover. As concerns of water
   scarcity and vulnerability move to the forefront, our watershed
   classifications should be extended to include ecosystem and
   social-ecological parameters. An integrated and agent-based modeling
   scheme called Envision has been developed to simulate alternative future
   landscapes at the watershed scale. Using fully coupled models of
   hydrology, ecosystems, and socioeconomics, decision-makers can simulate
   the effects of policy decisions in conjunction with other climate
   forcing, land use change, and economic disturbances. To understand the
   combined impacts of climate change and humans on water in mountain
   watersheds, researchers must develop integrated monitoring and modeling
   systems that explicitly include connections across eco-hydrologic and
   social-ecological systems.},

Title = {Agricultural intensification and risk in water-constrained hard-rock
   regions: a social-ecological systems study of horticulture cultivation
   in western India},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {25},
Number = {4},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Developing countries frequently find their poverty reduction initiatives
   to be at odds with promotion of sustainable practices. In India too,
   agricultural intensification through horticulture cultivation is an
   important government strategy to raise farm incomes but its mechanisms
   and implications have not been critically analyzed. Our objective is to
   characterize this intensification and explore conditions under which its
   goals may be achieved while ensuring equity in access to ecological
   services and resilience of the social-ecological system (SES). Our focal
   SES is the water-constrained farm system of western India that overlays
   shallow hard-rock aquifers common to the Indian peninsula. We document
   farm decisions and coping strategies of 121 farmers over two consecutive
   years: a drought year and a good rainfall year. We find that farmers are
   driven to high-value horticulture to remain economically viable in the
   face of increasing social-ecological vulnerability due to factors such
   as monsoon variability, high groundwater development, and uncertainty in
   irrigation access. Through systems modeling, we uncover the feedback
   loops that propagate risk. Risk in access to water, in part due to
   monsoon dry spells, starts a cycle of expensive investments often
   requiring large loans to assure access and a simultaneous move to
   horticulture in response to the elevated cost of water. This mitigates
   risk for the farmer in the short run but, in the absence of regulation
   and complete information about the common groundwater pool, leads to
   competitive investments, driving the regime to greater uncertainty
   levels for the entire community. This vicious cycle of investment and
   intensification escalates risk, leading to frequent crop failure, farmer
   indebtedness, and the tragedy of the commons. Government interventions
   further catalyze this. We propose alternate leverage points to enhance
   social comprehension of risk and facilitate collective action so as to
   negotiate room for human needs while remaining within biophysical
   boundaries.},

Abstract = {Policy-making in social-ecological systems increasingly looks to
   iterative, evolutionary approaches that can address the inherent
   complexity of interactions between human wellbeing, provision of goods,
   and the maintenance of ecosystem services. Here, we show how the
   analysis of available time-series in tropical delta regions over past
   decades can provide important insight into the social-ecological system
   dynamics in deltaic regions. The paper provides an exploratory analysis
   of the recent changes that have occurred in the major elements of three
   tropical deltaic social-ecological systems, such as demography, economy,
   health, climate, food, and water. Time-series data from official
   statistics, monitoring programmes, and Earth observation data are
   analysed to explore possible trends, slow and fast variables, and
   observed drivers of change in the Amazon, Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna and
   Mekong deltas. In the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna delta zone, increasing
   gross domestic product and per capita income levels since the 1980s
   mirror rising levels of food and inland fish production. In contrast,
   non-food ecosystem services, such as water availability, water quality,
   and land stability appear to be deteriorating. In the Amazon delta,
   natural and anthropogenic perturbations are continuously degrading key
   ecosystem services, such as carbon storage in biomass and soils, the
   regulation of water balance, and the modulation of regional climate
   patterns. In the Mekong delta, rapid economic development, changing
   land-use practices, and salinity intrusion are progressively putting
   more pressure on the delivery of important provisioning services, such
   as rice and inland aquaculture production, which are key sources of
   staple food, farm incomes, and export revenue. Observed changes in many
   key indicators of ecosystem services point to a changing dynamic state
   and increased probability of systemic threshold transformations in the
   near future.},

Title = {Landscapes Toolkit: an integrated modelling framework to assist

Journal = {LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {26},
Number = {8},
Pages = {1179-1198},

Abstract = {At present, stakeholders wishing to develop land use and management
   change scenarios at the landscape scale and to assess their
   corresponding impacts on water quality, biodiversity and economic
   performance, must examine the output of a suite of separate models. The
   process is not simple and presents a considerable deterrent to making
   such comparisons and impedes the development of more sustainable,
   multifunctional landscapes. To remedy this problem, we developed the
   Landscapes Toolkit, an integrated modelling framework that assists
   natural resource managers, policy-makers, planners and local communities
   explore options for sustainable landscape development. The Landscapes
   Toolkit links spatially-explicit disciplinary models, to enable
   integrated assessment of the water quality, biodiversity and economic
   outcomes of stakeholder-defined land use and management change
   scenarios. We use the Tully-Murray catchment in the Great Barrier Reef
   region of Australia as a case study to illustrate the development and
   application of the Landscapes Toolkit. Results show that the Landscapes
   Toolkit strikes a satisfactory balance between the inclusion of
   component models that sufficiently capture the richness of some key
   aspects of social-ecological system processes and the need for
   stakeholders to understand and compare the results of the different
   models. The latter is a prerequisite to making more informed decisions
   about sustainable landscape development. The flexibility of being able
   to add additional models and to update existing models is a particular
   strength of the Landscapes Toolkit design. Hence, the Landscapes Toolkit
   offers a promising modelling framework for supporting social learning
   and adaptive management through participatory scenario development and
   evaluation as well as being a tool to guide planning and policy
   discussions at the landscape scale.},

Title = {Exploring Resilience and Transformability of a River Basin in the Face
   of Socioeconomic and Ecological Crisis: an Example from the Amudarya
   River Basin, Central Asia},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Water from the Amudarya River is a vital and strategic resource for
   semi-arid Uzbekistan because of its heavy reliance on irrigated
   agriculture. The Uzbek water management regime, however, has proven to
   be rather reluctant to adapt to changing environmental and
   socio-political conditions despite recent massive pressures caused by
   political, environmental, or donor-induced developments in the region.
   The aim of this paper is to explore reasons for the low adaptability of
   the Uzbek water sector and assess implications for the resilience of the
   Uzbek social-ecological system (SES). By analyzing past losses of
   resilience as well as first attempts at institutional change in land and
   water management, we identify drivers as well as structural factors and
   mechanisms that act as barriers for adaptation and transformation
   towards a more sustainable system. With the collapse of the Aral Sea
   fisheries and the basin-wide large scale soil salinization, the SES in
   the Amudarya River Basin has shifted to a new, less desirable regime.
   However, the high resilience of the social system is keeping it in its
   current undesirable state and further degrades its long-term resilience.
   Our analysis identifies reinforcing feedbacks caused by ecological
   dynamics, vested interests, and a patronage system that contribute to
   the resistance to change and keep the system locked in its current
   unsustainable state. These factors are rooted in the history of the SES
   in the river basin, such as the economic dependence on cotton and the
   state-centered management approach. The window of opportunity for
   significant changes of the larger scale institutional setting that might
   have been open after the breakup of the Soviet Union was or could not be
   used to achieve a transformation to more sustainable resources use.
   Measures aimed at an incremental improvement of the current situation
   are not sufficient to prevent further losses of resilience. Resilience
   and transformability of the larger scale SES (political, economic, and
   institutional settings) are needed to enable the smaller scales
   (regional and local water management) to adapt and change. However, we
   identified opportunities for change arising from the slow acceptance of
   bottom-up management institutions in the water sector and from the
   extensive restoration capacity of the ecosystems.},

Abstract = {Hydrological changes due to climate change will impact the
   sustainability of social-ecological systems (SES). It is essential to
   develop methodologies, capable of addressing economic as well as the
   environmental aspects, to take care of the water-associated system
   through improving the system adaptive capacity, particularly in arid and
   semi-arid areas. Through the application of the Post-Modern Portfolio
   Theory (PMPT), we propose a new approach to water allocation problem in
   the face of climate change, as a case of Lake Tashk-Bakhtegan basin,
   Southern Iran. The economic model based on PMPT is adapted for designing
   water allocation schemes to maximize local economic return, minimize its
   risk and minimize the Gini coefficient indicative of social inequities.
   The climatic variables were generated by three Atmosphere-Ocean General
   Circulation Models. The temperature and precipitation will increase and
   decrease by about +2.4\% and -10\% on average in the future compared to
   those in the historical period, respectively. In order to identify
   hydrological and socio-economic implications of climate change in the
   basin, an integrated system dynamic model was developed. Finally, the
   decision space of equally effective solutions has been determined in the
   form of Pareto points at the efficient portfolio plane. The findings
   showed a decrease in the economic return (on average by 5.7\% in the
   both RCPs) and the ratio of employment to unemployment (average 10\% in
   most of sub-basin), owing to the reduction of water resources,
   especially in agriculture. Base on Portfolio results, the ratio of
   economic return to risk doubled and tripled in optimized condition
   compared to the normal condition in the future. The efficient plane of
   the portfolio can be used to allocate water to economic activities
   according to a risk-taking attitude of a decision-maker. Following the
   model results, services and industrial sectors would need to be
   developed in order to sustain local water resources with possible
   additional allocations for environmental requirements, with simultaneous
   improvement of economic return on water resources. (C) 2018 Published by

Series = {Green Energy and Technology},

Abstract = {The world's population is growing constantly and, more importantly, the
   need for raw materials and food products is growing quickly, as a result
   of the western development model. The energy-consuming (energivorous)
   and consumerist nature of this model is being consolidated globally,
   ignoring both the issue of resource limitations, and the medium-long
   term environmental consequences (e.g. climate change, water pollution).
   This development model, in order to maintain its internal integrity and
   further develop (often at increasing rates of growth), needs to import
   energy and materials from the external environment and to produce waste
   and disorder (entropy) in an inexorable slide toward thermodynamic
   equilibrium. Sustainable development should focus on contrasting these
   processes as far as possible, and on developing suitable planning
   praxes. This paper aims to show how to achieve sustainable land-use
   through local resource evaluation, overturning the ``linear{''} logic of
   acquisition-consumption-disposal of wastes, in search of circular
   processes, capable of reducing entropy growth in a social-ecological
   system. An analysis of the exergetic availabilities of the landscape
   mosaic demonstrates great potential for exploiting energy supplies from
   local and renewable sources, thus lessening the system's overall impact
   on the global environment.},

   vexing social-ecological mismatch},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {226},
Pages = {321-328},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Horses have been associated with human societies for millennia, and for
   many have come to symbolize wildness, power, resilience, and freedom.
   Although equids were extirpated from North America 10,000-12,000 years
   ago, descendants of domestic horses now roam freely in the USA and 17
   other countries across six continents. In landscape-scale and
   experimental investigations, free-roaming horses (Equus caballus) have
   been shown to induce numerous alterations to native-ecosystem components
   and processes through influences on soil, water, plants, and other
   aspects of biodiversity. However, we argue that the management of
   free-roaming horses both in the U.S. and globally has been complicated
   by ``socio-ecological mismatches.{''} Such mismatches arise from an
   inability to reconcile conflicting processes and functions in a
   social-ecological system, often reflecting differences in the
   spatio-temporal scales at which diverse components operate. Here, we
   describe three types of mismatches, and illustrate how the ecological
   dynamics of aridlands generally fit poorly with existing approaches to
   horse management and policy. Such mismatches complicate cost-effective
   management of free-roaming horses and the ecosystems they inhabit, and
   reduce the palette of potential solutions.},

Title = {Love of the land: Social-ecological connectivity of rural landholders},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {51},
Pages = {37-52},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Understanding how landholders relate to the land and water they manage
   is crucial to sustainable natural resource management policy and
   practice. This study focuses on the relationship that rural landholders,
   both producers and rural lifestylers, have with their land and
   waterways, to provide insight into a social-ecological dynamic that
   contributes to social resilience. Mixed qualitative methods of semi
   structured interviews and photovoice are used to examine stewardship;
   place attachment and constituent components of affective, functional and
   cognitive connection; as well as sense of community, through a case
   study in the Mary River valley in South-east Queensland Australia.
   Powerful visual images from participant-derived photos illustrate rural
   landholders' views of the interwined connections of landscapes and
   communities and their `love of the land'. The study thus expands the
   breadth of methods used in investigating place attachment. It
   contributes to the theoretical understanding of how the integrated
   nature of stewardship, place and community build and maintain social
   resilience. Understanding landholder relationships and motivations as
   part of a social-ecological system can enable better targeting of land
   management support. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

   Life Experiences},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {10},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Blue spaces such as rivers provide many ecosystem services (ES),
   including freshwater for consumption, habitat, water quality regulation,
   and multiple cultural amenities. While many studies have quantified the
   biophysical supply of ES provided by rivers, fewer have explored the
   social demand for ES due to the considerable effort involved in
   collecting these data. The San Marcos River (SMR) and the Texas State
   University (TXST) students that use this blue space represent a dynamic
   social-ecological system (SES) where nature experiences shape student
   values of the system. In this study, we survey the TXST student
   population about their use, value, and perception of the SMR, a highly
   used river of which headwaters originate on and flow through campus.
   From our extensive survey of these students, we find that educational
   and life experiences matter. Overall, we find that student exposure to
   the SMR in space, time, and experience does have measurable effects on
   their use, value, and perception of ES. This SES study demonstrates the
   importance of life experiences, place-based knowledge, and experiential
   learning in influencing one's well-being and value of natural
   environments.},

Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {10},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Recent years have seen an explosion of interest in the resource nexus.
   This has created the co-existence of different understandings and uses
   of the concept. In this regard, experiences in the EU H2020 project
   `Moving towards adaptive governance in complexity: Informing nexus
   security' are consistent with findings reported in the literature: (i)
   The inconvenient message of the nexus is difficult to get across, it
   being incompatible with the currently dominant rosy narratives about
   sustainability. Indeed, from a historic perspective, the nexus can be
   seen as a revival of the ideological fight between cornucopians and
   neo-Malthusians; (ii) Silo structures in existing institutions are a
   problem for the governance of the nexus, and so is the resulting
   reductionist strategy of addressing and fixing one issue at the time;
   (iii) Scientific inquiry is currently not providing the quality inputs
   needed for a meaningful discussion of the resource nexus. Entanglement
   of resource flows is rooted in the complex metabolic pattern of
   social-ecological systems, the analysis of which requires a complex
   systems approach and relational analysis. Contemporary reductionist
   models simply make the nexus invisible to the analyst.},

Abstract = {The Brazilian Amazon faces three dominant governance challenges that
   have become increasingly interconnected over time and now affect each
   other: managing agricultural expansion, reducing deforestation, and
   mitigating urban floods. This region exemplifies that the governance of
   one social-ecological system (SES) in the Anthropocene can no longer be
   thought of in isolation of others because, together, they form a complex
   network of flows and spillovers to manage. Studying the interconnection
   of different decision-making areas, however, calls for an intertemporal
   examination of governance that integrates different methodological
   approaches. We use the Network of Adjacent Action Situations (NAS),
   Combined IAD-SES (CIS) framework, and the telecoupling framework to
   study these three interrelated processes in the Amazon. Employing
   mixed-methods research, including fieldwork covering each of these
   processes, we demonstrate how the governance of multiple SESs represents
   an intertemporal governance challenge. Our paper contributes to the SES
   governance and NAS literature by linking governance issues generally
   looked at separately and offering an understanding of the governance
   connections between telecoupled processes. Beyond its contribution to
   Brazilian Amazon governance, this paper offers an integrated framework
   that may be useful to study the interconnection of governance of NAS in
   other places.},

Abstract = {The Earth's population will become more than 80\% urban during this
   century. This threshold is often regarded as sufficient justification
   for pursuing urban ecology. However, pursuit has primarily focused on
   building empirical richness, and urban ecology theory is rarely
   discussed. The Baltimore Ecosystem Study (BES) has been grounded in
   theory since its inception and its two decades of data collection have
   stimulated progress toward comprehensive urban theory. Emerging urban
   ecology theory integrates biology, physical sciences, social sciences,
   and urban design, probes interdisciplinary frontiers while being founded
   on textbook disciplinary theories, and accommodates surprising empirical
   results. Theoretical growth in urban ecology has relied on refined
   frameworks, increased disciplinary scope, and longevity of
   interdisciplinary interactions. We describe the theories used by BES
   initially, and trace ongoing theoretical development that increasingly
   reflects the hybrid biological-physical-social nature of the Baltimore
   ecosystem. The specific mix of theories used in Baltimore likely will
   require modification when applied to other urban areas, but the
   developmental process, and the key results, will continue to benefit
   other urban social-ecological research projects.},

Abstract = {Urban growth has impacted natural ecosystems such as wetlands. This
   situation destabilizes the beneficial contributions of nature,
   generating a socioeconomic effect. There is a need to quantify the
   benefits of wetlands in developing countries and urban areas, where the
   growth of cities is fastest. This is the first valuation study of urban
   and peri-urban wetlands in Colombia. The methodology includes a benefit
   transfer (BT) method with a geographical information system (GIS) and an
   exploratory governance analysis. Because there are few studies on the
   economic valuation of urban wetlands in Latin America, we present a
   methodology of interest, which can be easily replicated in other cities
   of this subcontinent. Based on an economic approach, our results find
   that 76\% of the total value of wetlands is provided by ecosystem
   services (ES) of existence and legacy value, followed by maintenance of
   the life cycle of migratory species and water supply. Urban areas are
   identified where users benefit more than areas where the population
   exerts greater pressure on wetlands. Weak governance is due to the
   disarticulation between regulation, land-use planning, and the
   social-ecological system. This research contributes to urban wetland
   management policies, as well as to sustainable solutions in cities.},

Title = {Wild and Farmed Arctic Charr as a Tourism Product in an Era of Climate
   Change},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {5},
Month = {AUG 12},
Abstract = {The topic investigated is the social-ecological system of Arctic charr
   (Salvelinus alpinus) fishing and aquaculture as a tourism product in an
   era of climate change. Arctic charr is a resilient salmonid species that
   was traditionally an important part of the sustenance economy in Arctic
   and Subarctic communities as a source of fresh food throughout the year.
   Arctic charr populations have declined in recent years, in part due to
   climate change. These changes in the freshwater ecosystems in turn
   affect the cultural and economic traditions of freshwater fishing and
   consumption. This development has consequences for the tourism industry
   as hunting, fishing and consuming local and traditional food is
   important in branding tourism destinations. Fisheries are no longer the
   source of this important ingredient in the Nordic culinary tradition,
   instead aquaculture production supplies nearly all the Arctic charr
   consumed. In this paper, we pool the resources of an interdisciplinary
   team of scholars researching climate change, freshwater ecology,
   aquaculture and tourism. We integrate knowledge from these fields to
   discuss likely future scenarios for Arctic charr, their implications for
   transdisciplinary social ecosystem approaches to sustainable production,
   marketing and management, particularly how this relates to the growing
   industry of tourism in the Nordic Arctic and Subarctic region. We pose
   the questions whether Arctic Charr will be on the menu in 20 years and
   if so, where will it come from, and what consequences does that have for
   local food in tourism of the region? Our discussion starts with climate
   change and the question of how warm it is likely to get in the Nordic
   Arctic, particularly focusing on Iceland and Norway. To address the
   implications of the warming of lakes and rivers of the global north for
   Arctic charr we move on to a discussion of physiological and ecological
   factors that are important for the distribution of the species. We
   present the state of the art of Arctic charr aquaculture before
   articulating the importance of the species for marketing of local and
   regional food, particularly in the tourism market. Finally, we discuss
   the need for further elaboration of future scenarios for the interaction
   of the Arctic charr ecosystem and the economic trade in the species and
   draw conclusions about sustainable future development.},

Title = {Uncovering the political dimension of social-ecological systems:
   Contributions from policy process frameworks},
Journal = {GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {40},
Pages = {13-25},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Research on the governance of social-ecological systems often emphasizes
   the need for self-organized, flexible and adaptive arrangements to deal
   with uncertainty, abrupt change and surprises that are characteristic of
   social-ecological systems. However, adaptive governance as well as
   transitions toward alternative forms of governance are embedded in
   politics and it is often the political processes that determine change
   and stability in governance systems and policy. This paper analyses five
   established theoretical frameworks of the policy process originating in
   political science and public policy research with respect to their
   potential to enhance understanding of governance and complex policy
   dynamics in social-ecological systems. The frameworks are found to be
   divergent in their conceptualization of policy change (focusing on
   incremental or large-scale, major changes), highlighting different
   aspects of bounded rationality in their model of individual behavior and
   focusing their attention on different aspects of the policy process
   (role of information, attention, beliefs, institutional structure,
   particular actors, etc.). We discuss the application of these frameworks
   and their potential contribution, to unravelling the political dimension
   in adaptive governance and transformations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {Uncovering water quality and evaluating vulnerabilities of small-scale
   fisheries in Chilika Lagoon, India},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {10},
Month = {JUN 29},
Abstract = {Small-scale fisheries (SSFs) play a strong role in sustaining millions
   of livelihoods, food security, nutrition, and income globally but the
   fishers engaged in this sector simultaneously experience high levels of
   vulnerability and processes of marginalisation. Several factors are
   attributed to the multidimensional vulnerabilities the small-scale
   fishers experience, spanning both natural (e.g., natural disasters,
   ecosystem change) and anthropogenic (e.g., policy change, hydrological
   interventions, aquaculture) pressures. While there is much literature on
   various natural and human drivers of vulnerability in small-scale
   fishery communities, an absence of research connecting vulnerability
   with water quality is evident. Fisher communities often talk about fish
   in relation to the health of their aquatic habitats wherein water
   quality is seen as a key parameter. The link between healthy fish and
   good quality water has significant implications for strong and viable
   fishing communities. This paper examines these links further by focusing
   on the nature of vulnerabilities caused by water quality changes in the
   small-scale fishery system of Chilika Lagoon in India. We undertake
   detailed analysis of the invasive shrimp aquaculture activities and
   hydrological interventions for opening of a lagoon inlet with the Bay of
   Bengal as two dominant drivers adversely impacting water quality and
   increasing vulnerabilities of the entire small-scale fisheries
   social-ecological system. Our analysis suggests that there are strong
   interconnections between changes in water quality and the levels of
   vulnerabilities in the SSFs of Chilika Lagoon. Pollutants such as
   pesticides, and organic compounds accumulate in fish tissues and affect
   their growth, reproduction, and overall health. This led to declines in
   fish populations, making it more difficult for fishers to make a living.
   In addition to direct impacts on fish populations, poor water quality
   also has indirect effects on the social and economic vulnerability of
   SSFs. For example, contamination of water sources led to the reduced
   number of fish species reducing the amount of time fishers can spend on
   fishing activities. This also affected the marketability of fish
   products, reduced income and increased poverty. To fully understand the
   interconnections between water quality and vulnerability in SSFs in
   Chilika Lagoon, it is important to consider both environmental and
   social factors, as well as the complex feedback loops between these
   factors. The study helps in bridging a crucial gap in our understanding
   of the role of water quality in vulnerability analysis within resource
   dependent communities. We conclude with key insights on possible coping
   responses and adaptive capacity necessary for the small-scale fisheries
   communities to transition toward viability.},

Abstract = {In recent years more recognition is given to the benefits and risks of
   private smallholder irrigation development across sub-Saharan Africa. It
   is acknowledged for its capacity to adapt to local circumstances and
   challenges. This study assesses the heterogeneous character of private
   smallholder irrigation in the challenging environment of southern arid
   Zimbabwe, where family farms operate along sand river aquifers, forming
   a reliable natural storage of shallow groundwater. It investigates the
   drivers, characteristics, obstacles and adaptive capacity of this yet
   undocumented form of private irrigation in a historically marginalised
   area, and in particular also the discontinuation of these informal
   irrigation ventures. The research combines results from analysing
   satellite images, and quantitative and qualitative field work, whereby a
   social-ecological system perspective is applied.
   This form of private smallholder irrigation is distinct from most other
   documented cases in sub-Saharan Africa. First, because of the unique
   interrelation between the water source, technology need and
   fuel-dependency in an economically marginalised area. Second, because
   drivers for the emergence of private smallholder irrigation are not
   market-based but crisis-driven; recurrent droughts and frequent
   dry-spells, failure of collectively-managed irrigation schemes, and
   persistent economic instability. As a result, many families cease
   operations because they reach the limits of their adaptive capacity or
   they migrate. Those who succeed, manage to benefit from the abundance of
   water stored in sand rivers, the mobilisation of knowledge and cash
   through rural networks, and the existence of cross-border trade
   opportunities. However, they hardly ever pass the level of subsistence
   in an area where stable markets are absent. Organising potential support
   to private smallholder irrigation remains a challenging and disputable
   avenue as this might undermine its independent and adaptive nature.},

Title = {Sustainability transformations: socio-political shocks as opportunities
   for governance transitions},
Journal = {GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {63},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Faced with accelerating environmental challenges, research on
   social-ecological systems is increasingly focused on the need for
   transformative change towards sustainable stewardship of natural
   resources. This paper analyses the potential of rapid, large-scale
   socio-political change as a window of opportunity for transformative
   change of natural resources governance. We hypothesize that shocks at
   higher levels of social organization may open up opportunities for
   transformation of social-ecological systems into new pathways of
   development. However, opportunities need to be carefully navigated
   otherwise transformations may stall or lead the social-ecological system
   in undesirable directions. We investigate (i) under which circumstances
   socio-political change has been used by actors as a window of
   opportunity for initiating transformation towards sustainable natural
   resource governance, (ii) how the different levels of the systems
   (landscape, regime and niche) interact to pave the way for initiating
   such transformations and (iii) which key features (cognitive, structural
   and agency-related) get mobilized for transformation. This is achieved
   through analyzing natural resource governance regimes of countries that
   have been subject to rapid, large-scale political change: water
   governance in South Africa and Uzbekistan and governance of coastal
   fisheries in Chile. In South Africa the political and economic change of
   the end of the apartheid regime resulted in a transformation of the
   water governance regime while in Uzbekistan after the breakdown of the
   Soviet Union change both at the economic and political scales and within
   the water governance regime remained superficial. In Chile the
   democratization process after the Pinochet era was used to transform the
   governance of coastal fisheries. The paper concludes with important
   insight on key capacities needed to navigate transformation towards
   biosphere stewardship. The study also contributes to a more nuanced view
   on the relationship between collapse and renewal.},

Title = {Connecting changes in Euphrates River flow to hydropattern of the
   Western Mesopotamian Marshes},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {768},
Month = {MAY 10},
Abstract = {The Mesopotamian Marshlands are the largest wetland system in the Middle
   East. Historically, these marshes served as the floodplains of the
   Tigris and Euphrates rivers, and they are currently connected to these
   rivers via surface water feeder canals. Historically, the Mesopotamian
   marshes received consistent flood pulses during the spring season from
   March to May. In recent decades, however, several large dams have been
   constructed in the Tigris and Euphrates basins for irrigation purposes
   and power generation, severely altering the flow regime. which along
   with other direct anthropogenic activities, has severely degraded the
   marsh ecosystem. This work quantifies changes in the riverine flow
   regime and how they have affected the hydro-pattern of the western
   Mesopotamian marshes (focusing on the western Al-Hammar marsh) and
   describes the role of hydrological drivers that are important for marsh
   restoration. The total area of the Al-Hammar marshes has been reduced
   from an average of 2800 km(2) before 1970 to a minimum of 240 km(2) in
   recent decades, concomitant with reductions in annual average Euphrates
   River flow (at Hit) from 967 to 602 m(3)/s and marked flow regime
   alteration. While climate warming and reduced precipitation were
   observed in the basin, changes in the fundamental precipitation-flow
   relationship implicate infrastructural changes (upstream dams) as the
   primary reason for these changes. This analysis quantified how flow
   variability under historic and contemporary conditions have affected
   wetland area and other hydro-pattern characteristics and suggests that
   at an annual average of least 70 m(3)/s of water deliveries to the
   western Mesopotamian marsh are required to restore 1000 km(2) of wetland
   area. Our hope is that this focus on the river-marsh connection will
   help inform predictive models and scenario analysis for restoration of
   this unique social-ecological system. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {The production of contested landscapes: Enclosing the pastoral commons
   in Niger},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES},

Volume = {51},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Divergent adaptation to climate variability produces unequal adaptive
   capacities between user groups and contributes to a contested landscape.
   This article examines divergent adaptations in the context of land
   tenure shifts in the pastoral zone of Niger. The management of the
   pastoral commons is shifting from a commonly-shared to private regime as
   former pastoralists take up new livelihoods, such as irrigated
   gardening. A method combining political ecology and remote sensing is
   used to study social ecological system (SES) dynamics in order to
   demonstrate the relationship between divergent adaptation, water-based
   conflict, land tenure shifts and land use/land cover change. Examining
   pastoral and agro-pastoral users' historical perceptions of land use and
   tenure change, results indicate that disputes over the access to and use
   of commonly shared natural resources are linked to increasing enclosures
   of ephemeral and permanent lakes in the pastoral zone of Niger. Remote
   sensing-derived information is used to identify and quantify the area
   and volume of enclosures around commonly shared water sources in the
   northern pastoral zone of Niger from 2003 to 2013. The study identifies
   the government-supported development of irrigated gardens in the
   pastoral zone as a divergent adaptation with its related conflict
   dynamics between user groups and highlights the land tenure shifts from
   a commonly to a privately managed regime. The findings have broader
   implications for the wider Sahel and provide recommendations as to how
   adaptation programs could be better designed and implemented in the
   pastoral system. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Scenario analysis can be a useful tool to explore paths to a desirable
   future. This paper is a `future history' describing the how stakeholders
   in the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River basin of North America rallied to
   confront regional challenges 50 years into the future (2013-2063). This
   future scenario was developed by considering how nine drivers of change
   (aquatic invasive species; biological and chemical contaminants; climate
   change; demographics and societal values; economy; energy; governance
   and geopolitics; water quantity; and technology) might impact the
   region. This ``thriving and prosperous{''} scenario envisions that in
   the beginning, Great Lakes residents, scientists, and policymakers saw
   ``the writing on the wall,{''} recognizing that past approaches to
   environmental policy failed to provide long-term environmental, social,
   and economic prosperity. In response, policymakers in the Great Lakes
   region began formulating and implementing new policies, but actions were
   scattered across the region and uncoordinated across geopolitical
   boundaries. Recognizing the need to coordinate their efforts, Great
   Lakes stakeholders began ``marching in step{''} by agreeing on a common
   set of guiding principles for future policy actions. Building on this
   momentum, Great Lakes policymakers implemented a suite of regulations
   and initiatives that recognized the Great Lakes region as a complex
   social-ecological system. Between 2053 and 2063, the region began to
   reap the benefits of coordinated policy action. By 2063, the Great Lakes
   region showed how a long-term commitment to improving the environment
   can sustain a thriving and prosperous ecosystem and economy. (C) 2014

Title = {Regime shifts and panarchies in regional scale social-ecological water
   systems},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {22},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {In this article we summarize histories of nonlinear, complex
   interactions among societal, legal, and ecosystem dynamics in six North
   American water basins, as they respond to changing climate. These case
   studies were chosen to explore the conditions for emergence of adaptive
   governance in heavily regulated and developed social-ecological systems
   nested within a hierarchical governmental system. We summarize
   resilience assessments conducted in each system to provide a synthesis
   and reference by the other articles in this special feature. We also
   present a general framework used to evaluate the interactions between
   society and ecosystem regimes and the governance regimes chosen to
   mediate those interactions. The case studies show different ways that
   adaptive governance may be triggered, facilitated, or constrained by
   ecological and/or legal processes. The resilience assessments indicate
   that complex interactions among the governance and ecosystem components
   of these systems can produce different trajectories, which include
   patterns of (a) development and stabilization, (b) cycles of crisis and
   recovery, which includes lurches in adaptation and learning, and (3)
   periods of innovation, novelty, and transformation. Exploration of cross
   scale (Panarchy) interactions among levels and sectors of government and
   society illustrate that they may constrain development trajectories, but
   may also provide stability during crisis or innovation at smaller
   scales; create crises, but may also facilitate recovery; and constrain
   system transformation, but may also provide windows of opportunity in
   which transformation, and the resources to accomplish it, may occur. The
   framework is the starting point for our exploration of how law might
   play a role in enhancing the capacity of social-ecological systems to
   adapt to climate change.},

Journal = {ECOSPHERE},
Year = {2012},

Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The benefits provided by a healthy ocean are receiving increasing
   attention in policy and management spheres. A fundamental challenge with
   assessing ocean health and ecosystem services is that we lack a
   scientific framework for expressing ecosystem conditions quantitatively
   in relation to management goals. Here we outline and operationalize a
   conceptual framework for identifying meaningful reference points and
   quantifying the current ecosystem state relative to them. The framework
   requires clear articulation of management goals and is built on a review
   of current scientific understanding and assessment of data availability.
   It develops a structured approach for choosing among three classes of
   reference points, including: (1) functional relationships that establish
   the ocean state that can be produced and sustained under different
   environmental conditions, (2) time series approaches that compare
   current to previous capacities to obtain a particular ocean state in a
   specific location, and (3) spatial reference points that compare current
   capacities to achieve a desired ocean state across regional (or, if
   necessary, global) scales. We illustrate this general framework through
   the lens of ocean health defined in terms of a coupled social-ecological
   system, with examples from fisheries, marine livelihoods, and water
   quality in the USA. Assessment of ocean health and ecosystem services
   can be significantly influenced by the choice of indicators used to
   track changes in a management goal, the type of reference point
   selected, and how one measures the distance of the current state from
   the reference point. This framework provides flexible, standardized
   methods for evaluating ocean health and ecosystem services that can
   advance important components of ecosystem-based management, including
   marine spatial planning, ecosystem service valuation, and integrated
   ecosystem assessments.},

Title = {From input-output analysis to the quantification of metabolic patterns:
   David Pimentel's contribution to the analysis of complex environmental
   problems},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JAN 18},
Abstract = {This paper revisits David Pimentel's work on input-output analysis of
   agricultural production systems with the objective of demonstrating its
   (continued) relevance for the analysis of complex environmental issues.
   It is shown that his unique accounting procedure is grounded in
   complexity theory and that it effectively links expected relations over
   primary inputs and outputs exchanged with the ecosphere and secondary
   inputs and outputs exchanged with the anthroposphere (including labor).
   New conceptual building blocks are introduced to demonstrate that
   Pimentel's analysis can be extended across different hierarchical levels
   (crop typologies, commodity supply systems, agricultural regions, etc.)
   and dimensions of analysis to obtain a formal representation of the
   metabolic pattern of social-ecological systems. These concepts include:
   (i) state-pressure relation (extensive properties); (ii) flow-fund
   ratios (intensive properties), i.e., qualitative benchmarks to define
   typologies of agricultural production in relation to both the
   socioeconomic process (e.g., land productivity, labor productivity) and
   the environmental pressure exerted on the environment (e.g., water
   consumption, GHG emission and pesticide load per hectare); and (iii)
   relational analysis to scale up the analysis to higher hierarchical
   levels so as to acquire policy relevance. Examples of the pertinence of
   this formalization are illustrated using Pimentel's original data on
   grain cultivation in the USA. It is concluded that Pimentel's work has
   set an example for a holistic approach to complex environmental problems
   and has paved the way for a more general conceptualization of
   social-ecological systems as metabolic systems.},

Funding-Text = {I had the opportunity and honor to work closely with David Pimentel for
   more than a decade in the late eighties and the nineties. Undoubtedly,
   David's intuition for environmental accounting, his enthusiasm for
   research and teaching, and his active engagement with emerging
   environmental concerns shaped my research career. Only now, after two
   decades of struggling with narrow-minded environmental researchers and
   policymakers, am I able to fully appreciate the extent and relevance of
   David's work. His innate holistic and practical view of
   social-ecological systems permitted him to adopt a highly relevant
   system of quantitative characterization without pre-analytical
   conceptualization or formalizations. Whereas David dedicated his
   research career to exposing environmental concerns with numbers, I have
   spent most of mine framing David's insights in theoretical and
   conceptual terms thereby heavily drawing on complexity theory. In this
   way, I hope to have contributed to the due recognition of his work. This
   article builds on the work performed in the Horizon 2020 project
   ``Moving Towards Adaptive Governance in Complexity: Informing Nexus
   Security{''} (MAGIC). It could not possibly exist without the efforts
   and insights of the MAGIC consortium, and notably that of the UAB team.

   innovation program under Grant Agreement No. 689669. I also wish to

Title = {Collapse of a historic oyster fishery: diagnosing causes and identifying
   paths toward increased resilience},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {20},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {Diagnosing causal factors of change at the ecosystem level is
   challenging because multiple drivers often interact at various spatial
   and temporal scales. We employ an integrated natural and social science
   approach to assess potential mechanisms leading to the collapse of an
   estuarine social-ecological system, and recommend future paths to
   increased system resilience. Our case study is the collapse of the
   eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) fishery in Apalachicola Bay,
   Florida, USA, and the associated impacts on local resource dependent
   communities. The oyster fishery collapse is the most recent in a series
   of environmental stressors to this region, which have included
   hurricanes and tropical storms, drought, and the Deepwater Horizon oil
   spill. We found it likely that the oyster collapse was not related to
   contamination from the recent oil spill, but rather to factors affecting
   oyster recruitment and survival, which may have been mediated by both
   human, e.g., fishing-related habitat alteration, and environmental,
   e.g., increased natural mortality from predators and disease, factors.
   The relative impact of each of these factors is likely to increase in
   the future because of changing climate and increased demand for fishery,
   water, and petroleum resources. Successful restoration and persistence
   of a viable oyster fishery will depend on: (1) implementation of some
   minimal best management practices, e.g., extensive habitat restoration
   via shell addition, and some spatial closures to harvest, (2) improving
   environmental knowledge and promoting episodic learning through enhanced
   monitoring and experimental management, and (3) continued community
   engagement necessary to produce adaptable governance suitable to
   responding to future unexpected challenges.},

Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {18},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {Most assessments of resilience have been focused on local conditions.
   Studies focused on the relationship between humanity and environmental
   degradation are rare, and are rarely comprehensive. We investigated
   multiple social-ecological factors for 100 countries around the globe in
   relation to the percentage of invasions and extinctions within each
   country. These 100 countries contain approximately 87\% of the world's
   population, produce 43\% of the world's per capita gross domestic
   product (GDP), and take up 74\% of the earth's total land area. We used
   an information theoretic approach to determine which models were most
   supported by our data, utilizing an a priori set of plausible models
   that included a combination of 15 social-ecological variables, each
   social-ecological factor by itself, and selected social-ecological
   factors grouped into three broad classes. These variables were per
   capita GDP, export-import ratio, tourism, undernourishment, energy
   efficiency, agricultural intensity, rainfall, water stress, wilderness
   protection, total biodiversity, life expectancy, adult literacy,
   pesticide regulation, political stability, and female participation in
   government. Our results indicate that as total biodiversity and total
   land area increase, the percentage of endangered birds also increases.
   As the independent variables (agricultural intensity, rainfall, water
   stress, and total biodiversity) in the ecological class model increase,
   the percentage of endangered mammals in a country increases. The
   percentage of invasive birds and mammals in a country increases as per
   capita GDP increases. As life expectancy increases, the percentage of
   invasive and endangered birds and mammals increases. Although our
   analysis does not determine mechanisms, the patterns observed in this
   study provide insight into the dynamics of a complex, global,
   social-ecological system.},

Abstract = {Management actions often need to be taken in the absence of ecological
   information to mitigate the impact of pressing environmental problems.
   Managers counteracted the detrimental effects of cultural acidification
   on aquatic ecosystems during the industrial era using liming to salvage
   biodiversity and ecosystem services. However, historical contingencies,
   i.e., whether lakes were naturally acidic or degraded because of
   acidification, were largely unknown and therefore not accounted for in
   management. It is uncertain whether liming outcomes had a potentially
   detrimental effect on naturally acidic lakes. Evidence from
   paleolimnological reconstructions allowed us to analyze community
   structure in limed acidified and naturally acidic lakes, and acidified
   and circumneutral references. We analyzed community structure of
   phytoplankton, zooplankton, macroinvertebrates (littoral, sublittoral,
   profundal), and fish between 2000 and 2004. Naturally acidic limed lakes
   formed communities that were not representative of the other lake types.
   The occurrence of fish species relevant for ecosystem service
   provisioning (fisheries potential) in naturally acidic limed lakes were
   confounded by biogeographical factors. In addition, sustained changes in
   water quality were conducive to harmful algal blooms. This highlights a
   pathological outcome of liming lakes when their naturally acidic
   conditions are not accounted for. Because liming is an important
   social-ecological system, sustained ecological change of lakes might
   incur undesired costs for societies in the long term.},

Title = {Enhancing the social-ecological resilience of an urban lake for
   sustainable management},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 NOV 16},
Abstract = {Lake ecosystems are complex social-ecological systems facing ecological,
   economic, and social challenges influenced by natural and social
   factors. The Dal Lake is an urban lake in the Kashmir Himalaya that
   serves as a prime example of such a complex system, highlighting the
   intricate connections between the socio-economic activities and the
   natural environment. Using a case study of the Dal Lake, this study
   employs remote sensing tools, ecological and socio-economic data, along
   with stakeholder perceptions, to evaluate the driving forces, pressures,
   and potential strategies for enhancing the lake's social-ecological
   resilience. The study highlights the significant challenges faced by the
   Dal Lake social-ecological system in its ecological, economic, social,
   and cultural domains, rendering it vulnerable to current and future
   disruptions. Population expansion, rapid urbanization, pollution,
   agriculture expansion, invasive species, settlements, and inadequate
   management have disrupted the ecological integrity and the
   socio-economic dynamics of the lake. To enhance social-ecological
   resilience, adaptive management of the lake ecosystem is recommended as
   a crucial tool for sustainable management. The multidisciplinary
   approach employed in this study provides an integrated understanding of
   the state, challenges, and opportunities for developing
   social-ecological resilience in the Dal Lake, enabling informed
   decision-making for its future restoration and sustainable management.},

Title = {Biological Diversity and Resilience: Lessons from the Recovery of
   Cichlid Species in Lake Victoria},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {A fundamental feature of the Anthropocene is the inexorable erosion of
   the self-repairing capacity or adaptive renewal of natural systems
   because of natural perturbation, exploitation, or management failure.
   The concept of resilience offers a systematic framework for
   understanding the dynamics and variables that govern response dynamics
   of ecosystems. Resilience of haplochromine cichlids is assessed using
   limnological and biodiversity changes in Lake Victoria, the world's
   second largest freshwater lake, over the last five decades. The review
   explores the resurgence of the haplochromine cichlids using Holling's
   adaptive renewal cycle and attempts to illustrate how resilience-based
   management approaches might learn from an inadvertent management
   experiment. The introduction in the 1980s of the Nile perch (Lates
   niloticus), a fecund and voracious predator of the endemic phytoplankton
   feeding haplochromine cichlids, anthropogenic eutrophication, and deep
   water hypoxia have combined in a synergistic way to increase the
   vulnerability of the lake ecosystem to perturbations that were hitherto
   absorbed. However, the upsurge in commercial Nile perch fishing appears
   to be enabling the resurgence of the haplochromine cichlids. The
   resurgence of haplochromine cichlids is characterized by phenotypic
   plasticity, ecological and life history traits and demonstrates the
   critical role of response diversity in the maintenance of systems
   resilience. Resilience of the haplochromine cichlids resides in the
   requisite functional response diversity and habitat diversity that
   provide the resources for renewal and regeneration. This paper concludes
   that management of Nile perch fisheries and control of nutrient loading
   into Lake Victoria could halt or reverse eutrophication, hence offer the
   best promise for a diverse, productive, and resilient social-ecological
   system.},

Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},

Abstract = {Shade-grown coffee is an important reservoir for tropical biodiversity,
   but habitat quality hinges on decisions made by farmers. Our research
   aims to investigate the link between coffee producers' decisions and
   outcomes for biodiversity, using epiphytes as our focal group. Using
   qualitative methods, we interviewed 33 producers in northern Nicaragua
   to understand how they connect trees and epiphytes on their farms to
   ecosystem services and how personal values, access to agronomic
   expertise, labor supply, and financial stability influence
   decision-making. We used interview responses to construct six producer
   typologies. Most producers had strong positive attitudes toward trees
   and associated them with a variety of important ecosystem services.
   Smallholders were more likely to connect trees with provisioning
   services, while producers on larger farms and with greater agronomic
   knowledge emphasized regulating services. Most producers connected
   epiphytes primarily with aesthetic values. Across demographics,
   producers emphasized the restorative potential for shade coffee in
   repairing damage to soil, water, and nutrient cycles caused by other
   forms of agriculture. The conservation significance and sustainability
   of this social-ecological system can be maintained and expanded through
   economic and capacity-building conservation interventions, especially
   when those can be connected to values already held by farmers.},

Year = {2020},

Pages = {1-13},
Abstract = {Social-ecological transitions in the silvopastoral system of San Isidro,
   Rosario, Batangas, Philippines were analyzed using land cover trends and
   community perceptions. A combination of remote sensing processing,
   randomized survey, and participatory approaches were conducted. Four of
   six land cover categories (forests/ orchards, grasslands, crop.fields
   and water bodies) were identified to be sources of ecosystem services in
   the landscape which are essentialfor cattle farming. In 2000, the
   landscape became an on-fbrin research site on cattlefarming. Coupled
   with other social factors such as land privatization and infrastructure
   development, this has reshaped land cover changes over time. In
   response, cattle farming dynamics, especially during critical dry
   periods, have adapted through measures such as switching to greater
   supplementation of commercialfeeds. Despite social-ecological
   transitions, the cattlebased silvopastoral system in the landscape has
   persisted by exhibiting key principles of resilience such as diversity,
   connectivity, andfeedback management. However, concerns on Arther
   impacts ofkey issues (e.g., landprivatization) should be addressed to
   sustain the cattle-based silvopastoral system in the landscape. This
   study provides critical insights on how natural resource management by
   communities andpolicies by decision makers should carefully consider
   their potential impacts in sustaining locally important ecosystem
   services in the face of rapidly transitioning social-ecological systems.},

Title = {Navigating Multiple Tensions for Engaged Praxis in a Complex
   Social-Ecological System},
Journal = {LAND},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {7},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Innovative, pragmatic approaches are needed to support sustainable
   livelihoods and landscape management in complex social-ecological
   systems (CSES) such as river catchments. In the Tsitsa River Catchment,
   South Africa, researchers and natural resource managers have come
   together to apply such innovative approaches. Since CSES are
   characterised by uncertainty and surprise, understanding and managing
   them requires a commitment to reflexive praxis and transdisciplinarity.
   Accordingly, we facilitated a collective reflection and learning process
   in the project team to deepen our understanding of praxis in CSES. Our
   findings indicate that CSES thinking created an enabling framing.
   However, building new linkages among diverse actors to put CSES thinking
   into practice is challenging, since it requires the development of novel
   working relationships. Existing institutional structures, power
   dynamics, and ways of working impose significant constraints. A deeper
   critical realist analysis of our findings revealed a metaphor which
   explains why this work is challenging. In this metaphor, the Tsitsa
   Project team is navigating a bumpy terrain of dialectic tensions. These
   are tensions for example between natural science and social science, and
   between science and indigenous knowledge. Based on this metaphor, we
   suggest an expanding role for scientists and managers, and recommend
   transformative social learning processes to support teams navigating
   such bumpy terrains.},

Abstract = {Urban growth in low- and middle-income countries has intensified the
   need to expand sanitation infrastructure, especially in informal
   settlements. Sanitation approaches for these settings remain
   understudied, particularly regarding multidimensional social-ecological
   outcomes. Guided by a conceptual framework (developed in parallel with
   this study) re-envisioning sanitation as a human-derived resource
   system, here we characterize existing and alternative sanitation
   scenarios in an informal settlement in Kampala, Uganda. Combining two
   core research approaches (household survey analysis, process modeling),
   we elucidate factors associated with user satisfaction and evaluate each
   scenario's resource recovery potential, economic implications, and
   environmental impacts. We find that existing user satisfaction is
   associated with factors including cleaning frequency, sharing, and type
   of toilets, and we demonstrate that alternative sanitation systems may
   offer multidimensional improvements over existing latrines, drying beds,
   and lagoons. Transitioning to anaerobic treatment could recover energy
   while reducing overall net costs by 26-65\% and greenhouse gas emissions
   by 38-59\%. Alternatively, replacing pit latrines with container-based
   facilities greatly improves recovery potential in most cases (e.g., a 2-
   to 4-fold increase for nitrogen) and reduces emissions by 46-79\%,
   although costs increase. Overall, this work illustrates how our
   conceptual framework can guide empirical research, offering insight into
   sanitation for informal settlements and more sustainable resource
   systems.},

Title = {Valuing cultural ecosystem services: Agricultural heritage in Chiloe
   island, southern Chile},
Journal = {ECOSYSTEM SERVICES},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {7},
Pages = {66-75},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Valuation of cultural ecosystem services (CES) remains one of the most
   difficult and least accomplished tasks in ecosystem services research.
   In this study the Contingent Valuation Method with the double bounded
   dichotomous choice format was used to elicit WTP for agricultural
   heritage (AH) conservation, which was modeled using a Bivariate Probit
   specification. The hypothesis tested was that WTP decreased with
   distance from the site of provision of AH. Results show no significant
   differences in WTP across locations with equivalent means of US\$50.8,
   US\$36.2 and US\$52.5 for Chiloe (site of AH provision), Valdivia (at
   379 km from Chiloe), and Santiago (at 1198 km from Chiloe),
   respectively, suggesting that non-use values can be equally important
   for local as well as distant populations, particularly when the CES can
   be ascribed to emblematic cultural landscapes such as Chiloe.
   Aggregation of individual WTP demonstrates the importance of AH as a
   highly valued CES and sustains the recent designation of Chiloe as a
   Global Importance Agricultural Heritage System (GIAHS) pilot site The
   study might prompt authorities to generate the proper incentives to move
   from just a GIAHS label to a real conservation initiative in Chiloe
   Island. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Structure Disentanglement and Effect Analysis of the Arid Riverscape
   Social-Ecological System Using a Network Approach},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {19},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {Riverscapes are coupled social-ecological systems (SESs), in which the
   differences between the scales and functioning of interacting social and
   ecological components ( ``mismatch{''}) impose challenges for global
   arid basin sustainability. Here, we defined riverscape SESs as networks
   of connected ecological and social components (nodes) to disentangle the
   structure and effects of SESs in Heihe River Basin (HRB) in arid regions
   of northwest China. Results showed the ecological network in HRB has low
   network density and high vertex strength. Heihe River Basin Bureau, as
   an emerging bridging organization, changed the SES structure and
   increased the matching degree of SES from 0.33 to 0.53, which has caused
   an obvious improvement in the downstream ecology. However, the
   characteristics of the ecological network demonstrated that
   cross-boundary management actions restricted to only the river would
   exacerbate local environmental pressures, such as the continued decline
   of groundwater in midstream regions and the potential appropriation of
   water for ecology by the expanding farmland in the downstream region.
   Our study demonstrated that network analysis could be one promising
   direction to untangle the complex SES and understand the relationship
   between SES structure and outcomes. We suggest comanaging the
   cross-boundary river and lands to further match the SES for basin
   sustainability.},

Abstract = {This study explores the application of a civic perception analysis in
   the context of stream restoration as a social-ecological system (SES).
   Analysing such a SES is useful for understanding correlations between
   civic interests and environmental conditions in river restoration. An
   analytic hierarchy process (AHP) analysis was used to quantify the
   demand for restoration objectives. Additionally, an image-based survey
   was used to precisely capture residents' perceptions of urban stream
   restoration by comparing aesthetic images, hydrologic functions, and
   environmental quality. Based on the AHP results, a hierarchical multiple
   regression was derived. A total of 181 participants responded to our
   survey, and the results were summarized by each subwatershed in the
   An'Yang watershed. The results demonstrated that the perceptions of
   residents who live in various environmental and regional conditions may
   manifoldly reflect their personal visual and aesthetic preferences by
   subwatershed. The upstream subwatershed values (SW1 = 7.86 and SW2 =
   7.39) were higher than those in the downstream areas (SW5 = 5.28 and SW6
   = 5.15). Consequently, this hierarchical multilevel model showed that
   individual environmental perception was highly associated with visual
   preference regarding stream restoration at the subwatershed level (p <
   0.001). Urban environmental and spatial planners could use such
   information when restoring and designing waterfront spaces.},

Abstract = {1. A key challenge facing ecologists and ecosystem managers is
   understanding what drives unexpected shifts in ecosystems and limits the
   effectiveness of human interventions. Research that integrates and
   analyses data from natural and social systems can provide important
   insight for unravelling the complexity of these dynamics. It is,
   therefore, a critical step towards the development of evidence-based,
   whole-system management approaches.
   2. To examine our ability to influence ecosystems that are behaving in
   unexpected ways, we explore three prominent cases of ``ecological
   surprise.{''} We captured the social-ecological systems (SES) using key
   variables and interactions from Ostrom's SES framework, which integrates
   broader ecosystem processes (e.g. climate, connectivity), management
   variables (e.g. quotas, restrictions, monitoring), resource use
   behaviours (e.g. harvesting) and the resource unit (e.g. trees, fish,
   clean water) being managed.
   3. Structural equation modelling revealed that management interventions
   often influenced resource use behaviours (e.g. rules and limits strongly
   affected harvest or pollution), but they did not have a significant
   effect on the abundance of the managed resource. Instead, most resource
   variability was related to ecological processes and feedbacks operating
   at broader spatial or temporal scales than management interventions,
   which locked the resource system into the degraded state.},

Abstract = {Integrating social and ecological aspects of bivalve aquaculture in
   research and management processes can improve understanding of the
   system as a whole, and facilitate management decision-making. We created
   social-ecological conceptual models of Pacific oyster (Crassostrea
   gigas), Manila clam (Venerupis philippinarum), and Pacific geoduck
   (Panopea generosa) aquaculture in a USA estuary, which were the basis of
   qualitative network analysis to compare: (i) social-ecological models
   versus truncated ecological- and social- only models, and (ii) two
   geoduck models representing different stakeholder groups' perspectives
   on nature-based recreation and environmental stewardship. The
   social-ecological models predicted different results compared to
   individual social or ecological models, including for abundance of
   invertebrates, eelgrass, and marine water quality. The two alternative
   geoduck models predicted outcomes that varied across multiple
   social-ecological variables, including the availability of local
   harvestable food, sense of place, and abundance of invertebrates in
   structured habitat. Results demonstrate the interconnectedness of the
   social and ecological components of the aquaculture system, and how
   predicted outcomes can vary depending on their inclusion in the model.
   This study also demonstrates the value in considering a suite of models
   that represents a range of group perspectives to identify areas of
   conflict and agreement, and to recognize bias inherent in the models.},

Abstract = {Cruise-ship tourism is one of the fastest growing industry sectors, with
   itineraries that regularly visit marine parks and protected areas.
   UNESCO Marine World Heritage (MWH) Sites feature some of the world's
   most exceptional ecosystems, resulting in some cruise lines targeting
   these sites. To understand the extent of cruise ship visitation and
   determine perceptions of cruise ship sustainability within and across
   environmental, economic, and sociocultural dimensions, we conducted an
   online survey of 45 (out of 50) sites. The survey included responses
   about the characteristics of cruise ship visitation, strategies for
   sustainably managing ships, and ideas for encouraging sustainable
   practices. Among the 45 respondents, 30 (67\%) indicated that their MWH
   site hosts cruise ships or cruise ship passengers, and 25 sites have
   cruise ships that enter the protected area marine waters. Most sites
   (62\%) indicated an increase in cruise visitation over the last three
   years. While most sites regulate ballast water (73\%) and wastewater
   (73\%) discharge, common concerns focused on ship air emissions and
   wildlife interactions. Lack of funds generated by cruise ships toward
   community infrastructure was noted. MWH site managers expressed interest
   in developing site networks to facilitate sharing of ideas as a first
   step for increasing sustainability across all sites.},

Abstract = {Improved stormwater management for the protection of water resources
   requires bottom-up stewardship from landowners, including adoption of
   Green Stormwater Infrastructure (GSI). We use a statewide survey of
   Vermont paired with a cross-scale and spatial analysis to evaluate the
   influence of interacting spatial, social, and physical factors on
   residential intention to adopt GSI across a complex social-ecological
   landscape. Specifically, we focus on how three GSI practices, ({''}rain
   garden (bio retention),{''} ``infiltration trenches,{''} and ``actively
   divert roof runoff to a rain barrel/lawn/garden instead of the
   street/sewer{''}) vary with barriers to adoption, and household
   attributes across stormwater contexts from the household to watershed
   scale. Private landowners, who may be motivated more by on-site and
   neighborhood stormwater problems, may gravitate toward practices like
   infiltration trenches compared with practices (e.g., rain gardens)
   perceived to serve stormwater function over larger areas. Diversion of
   roof runoff was found to be more likely to be a part of a larger
   assembly of green behaviors. Improved stormwater management outcomes at
   the watershed, town, neighborhood, and household levels depend on
   adaptive approaches and adjusting strategies along the rural-urban
   gradient, across the biophysical landscape, and according to varying
   norms and institutional arrangements.},

Title = {Sustained by Snakes? Seasonal Livelihood Strategies and Resource
   Conservation by Tonle Sap Fishers in Cambodia},
Journal = {HUMAN ECOLOGY},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {36},
Number = {6},
Pages = {835-851},

Abstract = {This paper situates concerns for conservation of aquatic snakes and
   livelihood sustainability in Cambodia within a social-ecological systems
   context and thereby presents a challenge to conventional species-based
   conservation programmes. Fishing for low-value water snakes has become a
   widespread activity within the floating communities of Tonle Sap Lake in
   the last 20 years in response to new market opportunities, provided
   primarily by a crocodile farming industry. The scale and intensity of
   this new form of exploitation and reports of declines in catch per
   fisher have highlighted this activity as a conservation concern, yet its
   role within local livelihood strategies was previously unknown. We show
   that it is of increasing importance to the less well-off, and is linked
   to higher incomes within this group, where it potentially reduces their
   vulnerability to fluctuations and declines in fish catches. It is
   particularly important as a means to smooth seasonality of incomes in
   this flood pulse-driven social-ecological system. We argue that shifts
   between snake-hunting and fishing, as a market-driven adaptive
   livelihood strategy by the poor, may be more compatible with wider
   ecosystem conservation and development goals than alternatives such as
   increased fishing effort or converting floodplain habitats for seasonal
   agriculture.},

Abstract = {Ecosystem services (ES) research has rapidly gained momentum in
   environmental policy and practice. However, qualitative socio-cultural
   approaches are still limited, and therefore, ES important for people,
   are currently. not commonly captured. We performed 34 face-to-face
   semi-structured interviews to describe stakeholders' appreciation of ES
   from dehesa landscapes in northern Extremadura, Spain. A total of 45 ES
   were mentioned, and compared among different sectors and levels of
   governance. At the local level, people appreciated especially
   provisioning and cultural services. In contrast, regional level
   respondents showed more appreciation for regulating and supporting
   services, which included biodiversity conservation and climate
   regulation. Private and public sector respondents appreciated
   provisioning services more, whereas the civil sector mentioned
   supporting and regulating services more. For instance, water regulation
   was only mentioned by civil and public sector respondents, while genetic
   resource preservation was only expressed by the private sector. All
   sectors noted cultural services as key ES. We discuss most mentioned ES
   by respondents, the co-production nature of ES in wood-pastures, as well
   as cultural services as key ES of dehesas in coupled social-ecological
   systems. We conclude with policy recommendations drawn from the insights
   of this study. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This chapter synthesizes the research needs presented in the book and
   proposes actions for addressing them. It highlights the socioeconomic
   and biophysical characteristics, development, production and consumption
   patterns, challenges and threats and management approaches that were
   discussed in the preceding chapters and discusses the priorities for
   future Lake Tana basin research that were raised. The analysis shows
   that the basin has many unique features, and great potential for
   sustainable development, especially in water resources. The lake and
   basin provide multiple benefits to the local community, the region and
   downstream riparian countries. Many of the problematic trends in the
   region result from an imbalance between resource production and
   consumption patterns, and limited or poorly implemented conservation
   measures. The many and complex challenges and threats in the basin are
   caused, in part, by the lack of an integrated basin plan and poor
   collaborative mechanisms to share data and find sustainable solutions.
   The available data and information about the basin is limited. It is not
   well-organized, accessible, or used well for the basin's resource
   management. The identification of major research gaps and priorities for
   future research highlighted in this book, as well as the systems
   framework for integration and collaboration, provide a basis for further
   research and policy decisions to promote sustainability in the region.},

Abstract = {Institutional crafting requires purposeful communication between
   features of social and ecological systems. This paper evaluates the
   application of a specific research tool - Ostrom's social-ecological
   systems framework (SESF), which seeks to provide a basis for
   institutional crafting in the context of social-ecological systems
   (SES). We evaluate the application of the framework to empirical
   analysis against the background of some of its own ambitions and a set
   of conventional criteria for evaluating research. We found 20
   publications that have applied the SESF. The SESF proved useful in
   articles that use it for explanation, though they often played down the
   question of how they selected explanatory variables. Across cases,
   application of the SESF fared poorly in terms of consistency of use and
   measurement of categories. Moreover, generalization on an analytical
   level is similarly compromised by lack of confidence among authors
   concerning how to apply the set-theoretic principles that underlie the
   nested structure of the framework. In sum, much work remains in order to
   realize the ambitions for research that the SESF has laid out and to
   fully use its associated, path-breaking, interdisciplinary, and
   policy-relevant innovations. Notwithstanding these critical remarks,
   recent work in this area seems highly promising, not least for policy
   practice and institutional crafting. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {How ecosystems services drive urban growth: Integrating nature-based
   solutions},
Journal = {ANTHROPOCENE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {35},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Addressing urban challenges with nature-based approaches can improve and
   protect ecosystem services. Yet, urban planning has not efficiently
   integrated such approaches to manage land use. This paper examines
   interactions between human and natural systems that result in ecosystem
   services and changes in land use and land cover in urban areas. It
   develops a social-ecological model for land use and land cover change,
   and for ecosystems services that integrates nature-based solutions in
   urban planning. The model treats spatial variations in ecosystems
   services as both drivers and consequences of human decision-making in
   choosing commercial and residential locations that drive land use and
   land cover change. We tested the social-ecological model in Stockholm
   County, Sweden, on a 30 x 30 m grid. Results show that accessibility in
   ecosystem services drives urban residential and commercial development,
   characterized by non-linearity. Areas around existing urban centers show
   high accessibility in ecosystem services and high development
   probabilities, whereas smaller population centers in large areas enjoy
   high accessibility to ecosystem services and low urban development
   probabilities. Model results suggest place-specific nature-based
   strategies for addressing the heterogeneous spatial relationships
   between ecosystem services and urban development. (C) 2021 The

Title = {Evaluation of a new method for assessing resilience in urban aquatic
   social-ecological systems},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {22},
Number = {4},
Abstract = {Urban aquatic social-ecological systems (SESs) comprise socio-technical
   elements, the built environment and its management, and natural elements
   (water bodies) that provide ecosystem services. Changed hydrology, poor
   stormwater quality, and the modification of water bodies associated with
   urban development brings challenges for maintaining ecosystem services
   provision in an urban aquatic SES. Water sensitive urban design (WSUD)
   has emerged as a form of development that aims to better support the
   provision of ecosystem services. Resilience concepts provide a basis for
   discriminating between WSUD and conventional development approaches.
   Building on an existing decision support system, a new, preliminary
   method for assessing resilience based on the combination of the
   socio-technical capacity (STC) and natural capacity (NC) of urban
   aquatic SESs has been developed. The STC score reflects a multicriteria
   assessment of the characteristics of stormwater infrastructure and
   management. The NC score reflects an assessment of the state and
   trajectory of biophysical attributes of the system associated with the
   provision of ecosystem services. By modeling a series of future urban
   development scenarios in Auckland, New Zealand, the method has been
   shown to discriminate between scenario outcomes within constraints
   associated with the biophysical and built characteristics modeled.
   Results are consistent with key concepts of resilience theory: outcomes
   are grouped in regimes and exhibit hysteresis, with the ability of WSUD
   to improve the state of the system strongly influenced by the presence
   of legacy effects. The method provides a source of additional, valuable
   information that complements other indicators by providing a snapshot of
   the interaction of catchment management effort and outcomes and
   indicating the likely future state of the SES. Recognizing that the
   method is limited to providing a relative assessment of resilience and
   adopts certain simplistic assumptions, further research aims to
   investigate assessment methods that consider other, fundamental
   biophysical and social properties of urban aquatic SESs.},

Abstract = {Many ecosystems are actually social-ecological systems (SESs) consisting
   of mutually interacting natural and social subsystems. Resilience, the
   capacity to absorb or withstand perturbations while maintaining
   structure and functions, is an important feature of these systems.
   Indigenous or traditional knowledge is considered to be an important
   factor in being able to absorb change and maintain structure in the
   context of ecosystem dynamics. In this article, I use the framework of
   resilience to analyze how the Bedouin communities in Wadi Allaqi, Egypt,
   experienced and responded to the disturbing impact of Lake Nasser's
   formation in the mid-1960s. Prior to that disturbance, the Bedouin
   lifestyle was characterized by traditional pastoral life based on
   rotational grazing by their herds. Afterward, the Bedouins permanently
   settled along the shores to make use of the new abundant water resource.
   This resulted in overgrazing of the rangelands along the lakeside and
   the disappearance of the traditional pastoral lifestyle. However, the
   Bedouins later learned to use the Najas species in the lake, ushering in
   a new SES. This new system is based on tactical grazing along the
   shores, giving the rangelands the opportunity to recover from the
   temporary grazing pressure. I argue that because many degraded
   ecosystems are actually SESs, ecological restoration should also focus
   on societal-level measures.},

Title = {Reflexive learning in adaptive management: A case study of environmental
   water management in the Murray Darling Basin, Australia},
Journal = {RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {36},
Number = {4, SI},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Adaptive management is a structured approach for people who must act
   despite uncertainty and complexity about what they are managing and the
   impacts of their actions. It is learning-by-doing through deliberate
   cycles of experimentation, review, and synthesis. However, understanding
   the processes of learning and how they relate to achieving resource
   management goals is in its infancy. Reflexive learning-a process of
   identifying and critically examining assumptions, values, and actions
   that frame knowledge-is critical to the effectiveness of adaptive
   management. It involves adaptive feedbacks between stakeholders as they
   examine assumptions, values, and actions. Adaptive management has been
   applied to environmental flows because it offers a system for making
   decisions about tradeoffs. In the Murray Darling Basin (MDB), Australia,
   adaptive management is applied as a cycle of plan, do, monitor, and
   learn, facilitated by short- and long-term learning among stakeholders.
   An alternative conceptualization of adaptive management as an
   integration of single-, double-, and triple-loop learning across
   multiple levels of governance is presented. This is applied to
   environmental flows in the MDB to map adaptive feedbacks of reflexive
   learning. At the lowest level of governance (Water Resource Planning
   Area), goals are assessed as Thresholds of Potential Concern related to
   flow-ecology responses, which are reviewed every 3-6 years. At the
   second level of governance (Basin-States), Water Management Targets are
   the key goals; reviewed and reframed every 6-10 years. The highest level
   of governance (the MDB) is concerned with policy targets, with review
   and reframing over 8-15 years. Feedbacks that generate reflexive
   learning are complex and require commitment to move through the modes of
   single-, double-, and triple-loop learning. Effective adaptive
   management of environmental water requires practitioners to situate
   themselves within a matrix of information flow across modes of learning,
   levels of governance, and components of a social-ecological system,
   where reflexive learning drives the achievement of management goals.},

Title = {Biocultural Restoration of Traditional Agriculture: Cultural,

Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2018},

Abstract = {There are growing efforts around the world to restore biocultural
   systems that produce food while also providing additional cultural and
   ecological benefits. Yet, there are few examples of integrated
   assessments of these efforts, impeding understanding of how they can
   contribute to multi-level sustainability goals. In this study, we
   collaborated with a community-based non-profit in Heeia, Oahu to
   evaluate future scenarios of traditional wetland and flooded field
   system agriculture (loi kalo; taro fields) restoration in terms of
   locally-relevant cultural, ecological, and economic outcomes as well as
   broader State of Hawaii sustainability goals around food, energy, and
   water. Families participating in the biocultural restoration program
   described a suite of community and cultural benefits stemming from the
   process of restoration, including enhanced social connections, cultural
   (re)connections to place, and physical and mental well-being, which
   inspired their sustained participation. We also found benefits in terms
   of local food production that have the potential to provide economic
   returns and energy savings over time, particularly when carried out
   through a hybrid non-profit and family management model. These benefits
   were coupled with potential changes in sediment and nutrient retention
   with implications for water quality and the health of an important
   downstream fish pond (loko ia) and coral reef social-ecological system.
   Compared with the current land cover (primarily invasive grasses),
   results suggest that full restoration of loi kalo would decrease
   sediment export by 38\%, but triple nitrogen export due to organic
   fertilizer additions. However, compared with an urban scenario, there
   were clear benefits of agricultural restoration in terms of reduced
   nitrogen and sediment runoff. In combination, our results demonstrate
   that a biocultural approach can support the social and financial
   sustainability of agricultural systems that provide multiple benefits
   valued by the local community and non-profit while also contributing to
   statewide sustainability goals.},

Abstract = {Problem statement: The Zayandehrood River as the most important
   ecological factor in Isfahan plain, is the main factor in maintaining
   habitat and regulating of the region's ecosystem. In recent years, due
   to different reasons, the Zayandehrood has faced some issues include
   climate change, drought, traditional view on dam construction,
   population increase, using the age-old fanning method, water-based
   industries, excessive water withdrawal, integrated management
   segregation and unprofessional and illegal resolutions, dehydration and
   dried-up crisis. These issues have caused intermittent interruption of
   river water flow in the Isfahan city, and consequently, deficiencies in
   the cultural, social, economic and tourism dimensions of the city.
   Research objective: The research is based on the theoretical origin of
   landscape architecture discipline and adopts a systematic view of
   natural phenomena, considers the most important issue regarding the
   Zayandehood River crisis in Isfahan in the separation of its constituent
   components as a result of the lack of a systematic and holistic view in
   its analysis and management. Therefore, the main strategy to solve this
   issue is the overview of the river as an integrated system, continuous
   understanding of ecological issues, and analyze the impact of society on
   the perception of an urban river.
   Research method: This is a case study based on library resources, field
   observations, visual documents, and the adaptation of ``understanding
   and analysis of the urban river as an integrated social-ecological
   system{''} theory as research method deals with understanding the
   subsystems, discovering its internal relations, conditions, pressure and
   flow rate of water in accordance with the situation of the Zayandehrood
   river.
   Conclusion: The result of this study shows that the inconsistency
   between pressure and internal flows in ecological and social subsystems
   in this structure unbalance this complex, and its adaptability and
   self-organization properties have been disrupted. The issue should be
   noticed by recovering the neglected relationships between key social
   components (values, people, and government) and the lost relationships
   between ecosystem conditions and processes and the role of social
   infrastructure in massive decisions, also by implementing multilevel
   programs, timely and strategically return this balance to the system.},

   urbanization, transitioning from community spaces valued for water and
   cultural services to urban recreational spaces used largely by joggers
   and walkers. We focus on a set of seven lakes located in the urbanizing
   peripheral areas of southeast Bangalore. Some water bodies have been
   restored and managed effectively by newly forged collaborations between
   citizens and local government. Others are extremely polluted, and some
   have completely dried up and have been encroached. We use a
   social-ecological system (SES) framework to investigate why some
   locations have been successful in negotiating changes in governance from
   community-based systems to state management following urbanization,
   whereas other lakes have deteriorated. We use seven second-tier SES
   variables that were associated with self-organization in previous
   research: size of resource system, number of actors, leadership, social
   capital, importance of resource, existence of operational-choice rules,
   and existence of informal mechanisms for monitoring. We also include
   three third-tier variables previously identified as important in urban
   lake commons in Bangalore: scale and type of pre-existing pollution,
   exclusion of socioeconomic groups from the planning process, and
   networking with government organizations. We use this subset of 10
   variables to examine social outcomes of the lakes, which we define as
   the extent of collective action by residents working together for lake
   restoration and ecological outcomes based on the ecological condition of
   the lakes. Collective action was low in only one of seven lakes, which
   challenges the presumption that citizens will not organize efforts to
   cope with common-pool problems. However, only two of seven lakes were
   highly successful in regard to both the extent of collective action and
   the level of ecological performance. While one lake was small and the
   other moderate in size, these two cases shared similar ranking in all
   other variables. Both lakes were polluted at a relatively low level
   compared with the other lakes, and in both cases, the leaders of local
   groups were able to network with government officials to clean up the
   lakes. Unfortunately, the challenge of cleaning up urban lakes after
   many decades of pollution is very difficult without effective
   interaction with various governmental units. Our analysis illustrates
   the usefulness of the SES framework in examining the combination of
   variables that makes a collective difference in affecting the outcomes
   of collective action and ecological performance. Our findings illustrate
   the need for polycentric arrangements in urban areas, whereby local
   residents are able to organize in diverse ways that reflect their own
   problems and capabilities, but can also work jointly with larger-scale
   governments to solve technical problems requiring changes in major
   engineering works as well as acquiring good scientific information.
   Such arrangements can reduce transaction costs for city governments by
   actively engaging local communities in processes that include
   coordination of collective activities, design of inclusive and locally
   suited ecological and social restoration goals, and planning and
   enforcement of regulations limiting access and withdrawal. At a time
   when many city governments are facing financial and administrative
   challenges that limit their ability to regulate and maintain urban
   commons, models of public-community partnerships could provide more
   inclusive, equitable, and sustainable institutional alternatives. This
   is an aspect that needs significant further consideration because the
   attention of most urban planners and scholars has remained on
   privatization while studies of successful instances of cooperative
   action in the urban context remain few and far between.},

Title = {Frontiers in paramo water resources research: A multidisciplinary
   assessment},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {892},
Month = {SEP 20},
Abstract = {Interdisciplinary knowledge is necessary to achieve sustainable
   management of natural resources. However, research is still often
   developed in an exclusively disciplinary manner, hampering the capacity
   to holistically address environ-mental issues. This study focuses on
   paramo, a group of high-elevation ecosystems situated around \& SIM;3000
   to -5000 m a.s.l. in the Andes from western Venezuela and northern
   Colombia through Ecuador down to northern Peru, and in the highlands of
   Panama and Costa Rica in Central America. Paramo is a social-ecological
   system that has been inhabited and shaped by human activity since-10,000
   years BP. This system is highly valued for the water-related ecosystem
   services provided to millions of people because it forms the headwaters
   of major rivers in the Andean -Amazon region, including the Amazon
   River. We present a multidisciplinary assessment of peer-reviewed
   research on the abiotic (physical and chemical), biotic (ecological and
   ecophysiological), and social-political aspects and ele-ments of paramo
   water resources. A total of 147 publications were evaluated through a
   systematic literature review process. We found that thematically 58, 19,
   and 23 \% of the analyzed studies are related to the abiotic, biotic,
   and social-political aspects of paramo water resources, respectively.
   Geographically, most publications were developed in Ecuador (71 \% of
   the synthesized publications). From 2010 onwards, the understanding of
   hydrological processes including precipitation and fog dynamics,
   evapotranspiration, soil water transport, and runoff generation
   improved, particularly for the humid paramo of southern Ecuador.
   Investigations on the chemical quality of water generated by paramo are
   rare, providing little empirical support to the widespread belief that
   paramo environments generate water of high quality. Most ecological
   studies examined the coupling between paramo terrestrial and aquatic
   environ-ments, but few directly assessed in-stream metabolic and
   nutrient cycling processes. Studies focused on the connection between
   ecophysiological and ecohydrological processes influencing paramo water
   balance are still scarce and mainly related to the dominant vegetation
   in the Andean paramo, i.e., tussock grass (pajonal). Social-political
   studies ad-dressed paramo governance and the implementation and
   significance of water funds and payment for hydrological ser-vices.
   Studies directly addressing water use, access, and governance in paramo
   communities remain limited. Importantly, we found only a few
   interdisciplinary studies combining methodologies from at least two
   disciplines of different nature despite their value in supporting
   decision-making. We expect this multidisciplinary synthesis to be-come a
   milestone to foster interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary dialogue
   among individuals and entities involved in and committed to the
   sustainable management of paramo natural resources. Finally, we also
   highlight key frontiers in paramo water resources research, which in our
   view need to be addressed in the coming years/decades to achieve this
   goal.},

   perspective: A systematic review},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {124},
Pages = {90-100},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Major global initiatives such as the United Nations (UN) Sustainable
   Development Goals (SDGs) have overlooked the prospects of the river
   ecosystem in achieving SDGs (e.g., SDGs 6, 14), despite the substantial
   role of the river in human civilisation, and the contribution of river
   restoration to ecological improvement. Realising the role of river
   social-ecological systems in providing ecosystem services (ES) to
   society, we have made the first step, through a systematic review, to
   identify progress, gaps and future research directions for river
   restoration research across the globe. We systematically reviewed
   articles and summarised the trends of river restoration within the
   explicit context of ES assessment. The economic and ecological aspects
   of river restoration were the prime focus of major studies, whereas
   social benefits have been least addressed. The results identified the
   research gaps and future opportunities and tried to supplement those
   gaps by addressing the questions that need to be researched in future
   studies. The proposed conceptual framework is designed how application
   of ES perspective help to integrate social benefits in river restoration
   research. If we are to achieve sustainable management of water, food
   production and zero hunger goals, overcoming the identified conceptual
   and methodological gaps and conceptualising the river as a
   social-ecological system is necessary for future river restoration
   research.},

Abstract = {Shaping policy for environmental sustainability depends upon
   decision-makers conceptualizing problems in ways that are either shared
   or similar enough to communicate about, diagnose, and act. The quality
   of this shared mental model of a social-ecological system (SES) is
   paramount to its effectiveness. Fundamentally, the mental model must
   integrate multiple kinds of knowledge about the system. If the
   decision-making body's assumptions about, description of, and solution
   for a problem do not to reflect the many ways stakeholders know a
   system, then the products of that decision-making process are viewed as
   illegitimate. Sustainability policy must fit the often subtle social
   order of the communities expected to implement it. In this essay, we
   discuss how a systems-based perspective can be a versatile tool for
   tackling these challenges of knowledge integration and decision-making
   in the context of a complex SES. Using social theory of Pierre Bourdieu,
   we construct a conceptual model that illustrates a route for integrating
   locally known social complexities (power, influence) gleaned from
   stakeholder interviews (N = 57). Stakeholders and end-user groups may
   dismiss any model that they perceive fails to satisfactorily account for
   specific, locally salient social nuances. Our approach leverages the
   overlapping notion of ``capital{''} in social and ecological theory to
   demonstrate how reciprocal interactions between human and ecological
   systems can be adopted into tools for reaching viable solutions to SES
   problems.},

Volume = {21},

Abstract = {Human society has increased its capacity to exploit natural resources
   thanks to new technologies, which are one of the results of information
   exchange in the knowledge society. Many approaches to understanding the
   interactions between human society and natural systems have been
   developed in the last decades, and some have included considerations
   about information. However, none of them has considered information as
   an active variable or flowing entity in the
   human-natural/social-ecological system, or, moreover, even as a driving
   force of their interactions. This paper explores these interactions in
   socio-ecological systems by briefly introducing a conceptual frame
   focused on the exchange of information, matter, and energy. The human
   population is presented as a convergence variable of these three
   physical entities, and a population distribution model for Colombia is
   developed based on the maximum entropy principle to integrate the
   balances of related variables as macro-state restrictions. The selected
   variables were electrical consumption, water demand, and higher
   education rates (energy, matter, and information). The final model
   includes statistical moments for previous population distributions. It
   is shown how population distribution can be predicted yearly by
   combining these variables, allowing future dynamics exploration. The
   implications of this model can contribute to bridging information
   sciences and sustainability studies.},

Title = {Hydropower vs. fisheries conservation: a test of institutional design

Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},

Abstract = {New methods have emerged for testing common-pool resource theory in
   large-scale environmental governance contexts. We aim to contribute to
   that scholarship by assessing the relevance of Elinor Ostrom's design
   principles in the lower Mekong basin (LMB). The recent dam-building
   trend in the LMB has revealed a trade-off between hydropower development
   and the conservation of migratory fish species. The need to internalize
   or avoid the negative externalities of hydropower dam construction poses
   a new challenge to the LMB governance system and its main management
   body, the Mekong River Commission. Our objective was to explain the
   emergence of the trade-off and the capacity of the governance system to
   address it. Elinor Ostrom's design principles and other variables
   provided by the Socio-ecological Systems Meta-analysis Database were
   first coded with regard to secondary data and then tested against the
   capacity for cooperation of the LMB governance system. The lack of
   sanctioning despite a strong monitoring system, and the existence of
   fuzzy governance boundaries in the context of a powerful outsider like
   China, were particularly relevant to understanding the current
   cooperation stalemate in the basin. Other variables such as scientific
   knowledge, triggering events, markets, resource spatial heterogeneity,
   and heterogeneity of interests were also relevant.},

Title = {Farming by the sea: A qualitative-quantitative approach to capture the
   specific traits of coastal farming in Brittany, France},
Journal = {LAND USE POLICY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {125},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The forms and presence itself of farming in coastal territories changed
   profoundly in the 20th century. By contrast with other interface farming
   systems, such as mountain or peri-urban farming, coastal farming has
   rarely been studied as such and has not, until now, been considered as a
   useful category to describe and analyse production systems. The aim of
   this article is thus to address the relevance of such a categorization,
   using empirical data collected in Brittany (France) as well as
   contextual indicators, but also by carrying out a systemic
   qualitative-quantitative analysis, questioning the forms, depth and
   continuity of marine influence on farming activities at the local scale.
   We show that specific traits of coastal farming do indeed exist. A
   greater diversity of farming systems exists in coastal strip than inland
   at the regional scale. Four configurations of coastal farming were
   identified, which result from distinct dynamics and combinations of
   urbanization and environmental pressures on agriculture. But these
   specific features cannot be revealed without a comprehensive and
   historicized approach of its interactions with the coastal zone as a
   territory, rather than a biophysical milieu. These con-figurations are
   characterized in the typical spatial extent of coastal farming and
   spatial patterns of the transition to inland farming (gradient,
   discontinuities).},

Abstract = {Recurrent food crises and global environmental change are critical
   issues that pushed food security and sustainability to the top of the
   policy agenda. Policy-makers need assessment tools that help them decide
   what actions they should take to achieve these goals. This paper
   proposes a new metric system assessing the sustainability of food
   systems and diets at a subnational level adapted to the context of the
   Mediterranean area. Recognizing the systemic dimension of
   sustainability, the proposed information system builds on a
   vulnerability/resilience conceptual framework and considers the
   interactions between a set of biophysical and socioeconomic drivers of
   vulnerability and a number of context-specific food and nutrition
   security issues. A three-round iterative Delphi survey was conducted to
   involve a number of selected experts in the indicator selection process.
   18 indicators were finally identified for eight preselected causal
   models of vulnerability and resilience at the interactions between a set
   of four drivers of change (water depletion, biodiversity loss, food
   price volatility, and changes in food consumption patterns) and four
   food and nutrition security outcomes (nutritional quality of food
   supply, affordability of food, dietary energy balance, and satisfaction
   of cultural food preferences). Each interaction was disentangled in
   exposure, sensitivity and resilience. The exercise allowed discussion of
   a conceptual and dynamic framework for food systems, and identification
   of indicators that gather consensus among the expert community.},

Title = {Exploring Institutional Transformations to Address High-End Climate
   Change in Iberia},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Either meeting the UNFCCC Paris agreement to limit global average
   warming below the 2-1.5 degrees C threshold, or going beyond it entails
   huge challenges in terms of institutional innovation and transformation.
   This research describes a participatory integrated assessment process
   aimed at exploring the options, opportunities, necessary capacities and
   implications for institutional co-operation and innovation in the
   Iberian Peninsula under High-End Climate Change (HECC). Using in-depth
   interviews and a novel participatory research approach, different
   scenario narratives and pathways about the future of Iberia have been
   identified using Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs). Special
   attention is given to the knowledge and policy options needed to
   implement cross-border organizational changes and co-operation
   mechanisms that would support the Integrated Climate Governance of the
   Tagus and Guadiana river basins. We show that a wealth of institutional
   innovation pathways and specific options and solutions exist not only to
   reduce GHG emissions (mitigation) and the negative impacts of climate
   change (adaptation), but, above all, to generate new forms of
   social-ecological system interactions aligned with sustainability
   (transformation). In particular, and depending on which scenario
   contexts unfold in the future in Iberia, different kinds of
   institutional and governance capacities and clusters of solutions may be
   needed in order to achieve transformation.},

Abstract = {Understanding the complex dynamics of social-ecological systems (SES) is
   difficult because rigorous methodologies and methods for this purpose
   are lacking. Multi-scale (temporal and geographical) linkages and
   pathways can mask feedbacks. Thus, understanding SES requires
   multi-dimensional analyses. This study presents a potential methodology
   and method for multi-dimensional analyses of a SES in the Upper Rio
   Grande-San Luis Valley (URG-SLV), Colorado. A driver identification
   process identified 5 major drivers in the URG-SLV, including stream
   flow, climate, agriculture, and endogenous and exogenous policy. Several
   of these drivers possessed more than one longitude. Data for these
   drivers begins as early as 1852 and extends to 2007. Changes in driver
   longitudes (long-term datasets within a single driver; maximum, minimum
   and mean annual temperature comprise climate longitudes) were detected
   via change point analysis, occurring at several transitional points.
   Linkages were defined using known relationships between drivers (e.g.,
   stream flow and water rights). Cross-scale relationships between the
   URG-SLV and downstream users through policy changes and climate also
   presented a temporal cross-scale linkage. Using the relationships and
   cross-scale linkages, a historical evolution of the system was
   constructed throughout the 150-plus years of record to illustrate the
   effects of changes in drivers and cross-scale linkages in the system.},

Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {134},

Abstract = {Managing ecosystem service (ES) bundles to synergize their benefits is a
   crucial but challenging task for land-scape planning and sustainable
   development. However, few studies have focused on ES bundles for
   landscape management in complex mountainous social-ecological systems.
   In this study, we quantified four ESs, food supply, soil conservation,
   water conservation, and habitat quality, in the Bailongjiang watershed
   (BLJW) in western China by using multi-source geospatial data and
   related ecological and societal information from 1990 to 2016. We found
   significant spatial and temporal changes in ES patterns and their
   relationships measured in 1990, 2002, 2010, and 2016. We found both
   strong positive and negative relationships (P < 0.01) among ESs in the
   four time-intervals. The BLJW was divided into five landscape functional
   zones by the newly integrated method to link ES bundles and
   social-ecological indicators for landscape management. Land use,
   population density, agriculture, and animal husbandry were found to have
   greatly affected the ES pattern and the comprehensive ecosystem service
   benefit of the BLJW. We suggest governing the mountainous
   social-ecological system with the goal of building a watershed community
   of common destiny with a shared future for ESs and for integrated
   landscape management.},

   living in the cuvette centrale of the Congo basin have adopted
   flood-recession agriculture on islands in the Congo River, taking
   advantage of a secular shift since the 1980s in the hydrological regime
   of the Congo River. Analyses of the hydrological data reveal that this
   shift decreased flood risk and significantly extended the growing season
   on the islands, long enough to enable cultivation of fast-maturing
   varieties of manioc and other crops. Flood-recession farming on islands
   in the river is today not only an important source of food, but also a
   source of income for women, who are primarily responsible for seasonal
   cultivation of fields during the low-water season. Hydrological changes
   alone are insufficient to explain the adoption of the new agricultural
   practice; adoption also arose as a result of dynamic interactions among
   river fishing, trading, and broader socio-economic forces.
   Climate-change models project an increased frequency of extreme floods.
   Our results suggest that this change may limit island cultivation in the
   future. More generally, our findings point to the importance of looking
   beyond single-factor, solely environmental explanations in studies of
   climate-change adaptation.},

Title = {Drivers of change in the Social-Ecological Systems of the Gwydir
   Wetlands and Macquarie Marshes in northern New South Wales, Australia},
Journal = {RANGELAND JOURNAL},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {33},
Number = {2},
Pages = {109-119},
Abstract = {The Murray-Darling Basin is a Social-Ecological System (SES) of major
   importance to Australia and includes extensive wetland areas in the
   north-western parts of New South Wales. The Gwydir Wetlands and the
   Macquarie Marshes are the particular focus of this paper. These two
   wetland SES have undergone five successive adaptive cycles ( phases)
   since they were first visited by Europeans in the early 19th century and
   the ecological, economic and social drivers initiating each
   transformation to a new cycle are described and analysed.
   The arrival of the European settlers with their domestic livestock
   rapidly displaced the Indigenous SES and the wetlands were extensively
   grazed; during wet periods the livestock were moved out of the wetlands
   and moved back in as the water receded. More recent land-use changes
   resulted from the building of major dams to enable storage of water for
   use in irrigated agriculture. A consequence of dam construction and
   water use has been a reduction in the frequency and extent of flooding,
   which has allowed many parts of the wetlands to be continually grazed.
   Furthermore, as machinery capable of cultivating the very heavy textured
   soils became available, dryland cropping became a major enterprise in
   areas of the floodplain where the likelihood of flooding was reduced.
   With the reduction in flooding, these wetland sites have been seriously
   degraded. The final phase has seen the invasion by an exotic weed,
   lippia {[}Phyla canescens (Kunth) Greene], which is a perennial that
   grows mat-like between other species of plants and spreads to produce a
   virtually mono-specific stand. The domestic livestock carrying capacity
   of the land becomes more or less zero and the conservation value of the
   wetlands is also dramatically decreased. Therefore, we suggest that
   lippia should be classed as an ecosystem engineer that has caused the
   latest transformation of these wetland SES and suggest research
   directions to investigate how they can be managed to revert to a state
   in which lippia is no longer dominant.},

Title = {An impact assessment tool to identify, quantify and select optimal
   social-economic, ecological and health outcomes of civic environmental
   management interventions, in Durban South Africa},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {302},

Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {Using an environmental impact assessment (EIA) methodology, we provide a
   novel approach to identify and assess social-ecological outcomes from
   civic ecology interventions. We quantified the impact significance of
   six civic (community led) interventions implemented by the Wise Wayz
   Water Care (WWWC) local community programme (solid waste management,
   water quality monitoring, invasive alien plant control, crop production,
   recycling and community engagement), in two communities, situated in
   urban to peri-urban/rural environments in Durban, South Africa.
   Interventions resulted in 37 outcomes, of which 36 were positive and one
   negative. The resulting significance scores from the impact assessment
   allowed for interventions and their outcomes to be compared. The
   socio-economic outcomes were the greatest (21), followed by ecological
   (11) and health outcomes (6). Outcomes included access to education and
   training; improved quality of life; improved terrestrial and aquatic
   ecosystems; increase in recreation and cultural uses of natural areas;
   reduced health risks and increased nutrition. The most significant
   ecological outcomes resulted from invasive alien plant control, followed
   by solid waste removal and water quality monitoring. The greatest health
   outcomes resulted from solid waste removal and vegetable gardens,
   whereas the greatest social-economic outcomes resulted from the general
   operation of WWWC, solid waste removal, and invasive alien plant
   control. We demonstrate that investments in natural areas can deliver
   not only on enhancements in ecosystems and their services, but also for
   local community socioeconomic and health benefits. This study provides
   an intervention quantifying tool for practitioners to select optimal
   local management interventions, that can be aligned with desired
   outcomes related to specific community challenges and policy
   requirements. In so doing, this work shows the critical role that civic
   interventions play to ensure sustainability, and emphasises how
   social-ecological systems and ecosystem services perspectives can be
   used in practice towards achieving sustainable outcomes.},

Title = {Changing use patterns, changing feedback links:: Implications for
   reorganization of coastal fisheries management in the Stockholm
   Archipelago, Sweden},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {11},
Number = {2},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Property rights are important institutions for regulating the use of
   valuable natural resources from coastal ecosystems. In this case study,
   we identify and analyze property rights and user patterns related to
   small-scale coastal fisheries in the Stockholm Archipelago, Sweden. User
   patterns and user groups have changed significantly over the last
   century, as commercial fishing has been increasingly replaced by
   recreational activities. Interviews with local resource users and owners
   of water properties in two different areas, Moja and Orno parishes
   within the Stockholm Archipelago, revealed a very diverse pattern of
   property and user rights, with a large number of water and fishing
   rights owners. Recreational fisheries, including both sport and
   household fishing, seem to predominate in both areas, but ownership
   differs. In Moja, most waters are collectively owned, whereas in Orno,
   individual ownership predominates. Very few examples of local influence
   on fisheries management were found in either area, although the social
   structure for joint management does exist in Moja. Instead, larger-scale
   institutions at the regional, national, or international level regulate
   fisheries, often not addressing local conditions and fish populations.
   The ongoing shift in resource use has created a heterogeneous user
   group, and the limitations of centralized management authorities in
   dealing with the diversity in the coastal ecosystem have created
   mismatches within the social ecological system. Combined with a
   large-scale decline in coastal fish stocks, these mismatches challenge
   the existing local property rights arrangements as well as the more
   centralized regulatory management structure. A key issue for fisheries
   management is how to develop and stimulate appropriate distribution of
   management functions at different geographical scales and organizational
   levels. The complexity and diversity in archipelago fisheries call for
   multilevel arrangements and cross-scale coordination, and initiatives
   have been taken by both central governmental authorities and local user
   groups to collaborate concerning habitat restoration and protection of
   important spawning grounds.},

Title = {Addressing the resilience of tomato farmers in Ghana facing a double
   exposure from climate and market},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {27},
Number = {3},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Ghanaian tomato farmers are severely impacted by changing climate and
   related more frequent and extreme weather events such as drought and
   heavy rainfall. Furthermore, tomato production represents one of the
   main sources of income for these farmers, which leaves them highly
   exposed to market price variations. However, the full impact of changing
   climate and price variations for these farmers has not been assessed.
   Here, we examined how Ghanaian tomato farmers experience and respond to
   a double exposure from climate and market related shocks. The objectives
   were threefold: (i) to investigate how farmers in two different
   agroecological zones (savannah and semi-equatorial) experience climate
   and market shocks, (ii) to examine the major response strategies
   implemented in face of this double exposure, and (iii) to identify paths
   toward systemic changes to enhance resilience. A survey was conducted
   with 344 tomato smallholder farmers in the two agroecological zones. The
   results from the survey were complemented by semi-structured interviews
   and focus groups. We found that farmers are severely exposed to climate
   and market shocks, which causes a reduction in both production
   activities and revenues. A set of agricultural and water management
   practices, such as crop rotation, supplementary fertilization, and water
   tanks, have been adopted by farmers as response mechanisms to climate
   variations. However, no response mechanisms, other than agricultural
   diversification, are in place yet to face the economic shocks. Thus,
   enhancing systemic resilience becomes particularly important to face
   this double exposure and restructure and change feedback mechanisms
   within the current system. The reestablishment of tomato processing
   plants or formalizing the stakeholders' network could both be ways to
   integrate value-chain stakeholders and support appropriate structures.
   Encompassing both climate and trading attributes through specific
   agro-food policies are much-needed for a sustainable and resilient
   transformation of the tomato production system.},

Abstract = {Drylands are one of the most diverse yet highly vulnerable
   social-ecological systems on Earth. Water scarcity has contributed to
   high levels of heterogeneity, variability and unpredictability, which
   together have shaped the long coadaptative process of coupling humans
   and nature. Land degradation and desertification in drylands are some of
   the largest and most far-reaching global environmental and social change
   problems, and thus are a daunting challenge for science and society. In
   this study, we merged the Drylands Development Paradigm, Holling's
   adaptive cycle metaphor and resilience theory to assess the challenges
   and opportunities for livelihood development in the Amapola dryland
   social-ecological system (DSES), a small isolated village in the
   semi-arid region of Mexico. After 450 years of local social-ecological
   evolution, external drivers (neoliberal policies, change in land reform
   legislation) have become the most dominant force in livelihood
   development, at the cost of loss of natural and cultural capital and an
   increasingly dysfunctional landscape. Local DSESs have become
   increasingly coupled to dynamic larger-scale drivers. Hence, cross-scale
   connectedness feeds back on and transforms local self-sustaining
   subsistence farming conditions, causing loss of livelihood resilience
   and diversification in a globally changing world. Effective efforts to
   combat desertification and improve livelihood security in DSESs need to
   consider their cyclical rhythms. Hence, we advocate novel dryland
   stewardship strategies, which foster adaptive capacity, and continuous
   evaluation and social learning at all levels. Finally, we call for an
   effective, flexible and viable policy framework that enhances local
   biotic and cultural diversity of drylands to transform global drylands
   into a resilient biome in the context of global environmental and social
   change.},

Title = {The first nation-wide assessment identifies valuable blue-carbon
   seagrass habitat in Indonesia is in moderate condition},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},

Month = {AUG 15},
Abstract = {Seagrasses help mitigate climate change by capturing and storing carbon
   for a very long time. Despite their significance, multiple threats are
   putting pressure on this valuable habitat. Seagrass conservation and
   restoration is essential to maintain the carbon sequestration service,
   along with the other ecosystem services (e.g., fisheries production).
   Information on the status of seagrass habitat is required to enable
   proactive management strategies. In this study, we assessed the
   ecological status of seagrass meadows in Indonesia, a globally
   significant hotspot of blue carbon habitat, using five resilience
   parameters: seagrass species richness, seagrass cover, macroalgal cover,
   epiphyte cover, and water transparency. We collected data on these
   parameters from 18 locations across Indonesia and developed the Seagrass
   Ecological Quality Index (SEQI, range 0-1) that summarises the
   parameters into a standard seagrass assessment. We recorded that
   Thalassia hemprichii and Enhalus acoroides were the most common species
   in the sampling locations. Seagrass cover was on average 39 +/- 3.6\%
   (mean +/- SE) which was lower than measured 3 years before (46\%).
   Macroalgal cover and epiphyte cover were relatively low with mean values
   10 +/- 1.8\% and 22 +/- 4.4\% respectively. Most locations had clear
   water. Our analysis showed that Indonesia's seagrass meadows are
   generally in moderate condition, indicated by the mean value of SEQI
   0.68 +/- 0.02. These findings provide a baseline for seagrass
   conservation and management. It enables setting up of specific goals for
   management action plans, at both the local, national and international
   level, and where appropriate, track the progress of management actions
   based on threat mitigation or restoration over time. The SEQI is a
   useful tool to summarise the condition of tropical seagrass meadows in
   Indonesia and could be applied across Southeast Asia or the Tropical
   Indo-Pacific bioregion. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Participatory modelling for conceptualizing social-ecological system
   dynamics in the Bangladesh delta},
Journal = {REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {20},
Number = {1},
Month = {FEB 19},
Abstract = {The concept of complex social-ecological systems (SES) as a means for
   capturing system dynamics properties (e.g. interactions and feedbacks)
   has gained attention in policymaking and advancing evidence in
   understanding complex systems. In contexts with limited data, conceptual
   system dynamic models offer a promising entry point to overcome
   challenges in understanding SES dynamics, which is essential for
   managing the long-term sustainability of SES and human wellbeing. Here,
   we build on previous work focused on agricultural production and use
   participatory approaches to develop a conceptual System Dynamics (SD)
   model for the south-west coastal SES in Bangladesh encompassing multiple
   forms of livelihood (fisheries, shrimp farming and forests, as well as
   agriculture). Using qualitative methods, including focus group
   discussions with farmers, fishermen, shrimp farmers and forest people,
   as well as expert consultations, we identified interactions, feedback
   loops and thresholds for the SES. The conceptual system model developed
   independently by stakeholders is consistent with a model developed using
   an empirical approach and literature review. Feedback loops are
   identified for the ecological (e.g. climate and water, mangrove and
   salinity) and social (e.g. shrimp farming and mangrove, agricultural
   (e.g. crops) production and subsidy) sub-systems in the Bangladesh
   delta. The biophysical thresholds that impact social conditions include
   river water discharge (1500 to 2000 m(3) s(-1)), climate (28 degrees C)
   and soil salinity (similar to 4 to similar to 10 dS m(-1)). Exceeding
   these thresholds suggests that SES may lose resilience in the near
   future and increase the likelihood of regime shifts. Findings of this
   study contribute to the management of the deltaic ecosystem and provide
   specific policy recommendations for improving environmental
   sustainability and human well-being in the Bangladesh delta and can be
   further used as inputs into system dynamic modelling to simulate changes
   in this SES.},

Abstract = {Coastal deltas are landforms that typically offer a wide variety of
   benefits to society including highly fertile soils for agricultural
   development, freshwater resources, and rich biodiversity. For these
   reasons, many deltas are densely populated, are important economic hubs,
   and have been transformed by human interventions such as agricultural
   intensification, modification of water and sediment fluxes, as well as
   urbanization and industrialization. Additionally, deltas are
   increasingly affected by the consequences of climate change including
   sea level rise, and by other natural hazards such as cyclones and storm
   surges. Five examples of major deltas (Rhine-Meuse, Ganges, Indus,
   Mekong, and Danube) illustrate the force of human interventions in
   shaping and transforming deltas and in inducing shifts between four
   different social-ecological system (SES) states: Holocene, modified
   Holocene, Anthropocene and `collapsed'. The three Asian deltas are
   rapidly changing but whereas SES in the Ganges and Indus deltas are in
   danger of tipping into a `collapsed' state, SES in the Mekong delta,
   which is at the crossroads of various development pathways, could
   increase in resilience in the future. The Rhine-Meuse and Danube delta
   examples show that highly managed states may allow, under specific
   conditions, for interventions leading to increasingly resilient systems.
   However, little is known about the long-term effects of rapid human
   interventions in deltas. It is therefore critical to increase the
   knowledge-base related to SES dynamics and to better characterize social
   tipping points or turning points in order to avoid unacceptable changes.},

Abstract = {This paper provides an in-depth understanding of social dynamics in the
   form of kinship ties in matrilineal societies. It unpacks gender roles
   and relationships at the community level to understand how social
   structures, created by the pattern of relations, enhance or hinder
   coping initiatives during lake recessions in the Lake Chilwa
   socio-ecological system. Using qualitative and quantitative methods
   including in-depth interviews, Focus Group Discussions (FGD) and
   household questionnaires, this paper provides insights into how people
   in the Lake Chilwa social-ecological system prepare for and cope with
   Lake Chilwa water recessions by capitalising on their social networks.
   The findings have shown that during lake recessions poor households in
   the Lake Chilwa socio-ecological system are cushioned by fellow
   households through lineage networks. There is strong tradition secured
   through kinship ties where the generic term `mwambo wathu' (our
   tradition) embraces a group of formative norms enforced via a series of
   rules and rituals. Based in a matrilineal system, women have strong
   rights over land allocation and use in which the female sorority group
   `mbumba' is very stable. There is a great deal of reciprocity and food
   redistribution among the households. This self-organization provides
   deeper meaning about how people assimilate the dynamics affecting their
   social and natural environments. Specifically the findings provide
   evidence on how households, communities and their livelihoods in Africa
   are reconstructed as natural resources fluctuate. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {Assessment of green infrastructure performance through an urban
   resilience lens},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {289},
Month = {MAR 20},
Abstract = {Green infrastructure (GI) is widely recognized for reducing risk of
   flooding, improving water quality, and harvesting stormwater for
   potential future use. GI can be an important part of a strategy used in
   urban planning to enhance sustainable development and urban resilience.
   However, existing literature lacks a comprehensive assessment framework
   to evaluate GI performance in terms of promoting ecosystem functions and
   services for social-ecological system resilience. We propose a robust
   indicator set consisting of quantitative and qualitative measurements
   for a scenario-based planning support system to assess the capacity of
   urban resilience. Green Infrastructure in Urban Resilience Planning
   Support System (GIUR-PSS) supports decision-making for GI planning
   through scenario comparisons with the urban resilience capacity index.
   To demonstrate GIUR-PSS, we developed five scenarios for the Congress
   Run sub-watershed (Mill Creek watershed, Ohio, USA) to test common types
   of GI (rain barrels, rain gardens, detention basins, porous pavement,
   and open space). Results show the open space scenario achieves the
   overall highest performance (GI Urban Resilience Index = 4.27/5). To
   implement the open space scenario in our urban demonstration site,
   suitable vacant lots could be converted to greenspace (e.g., forest,
   detention basins, and low-impact recreation areas). GIUR-PSS is easy to
   replicate, customize, and apply to cities of different sizes to assess
   environmental, economic, and social benefits provided by different types
   of GI installations. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Title = {Are freshwater systems in lower Mekong basin (southeast Asia) resilient?
   A synthesis of social-ecological system},

Abstract = {Social-ecological resilience of freshwater systems in lower Mekong basin
   in southeast Asia is largely unknown. Over the recent past, the
   freshwater ecosystems in the region have gone through severe
   environmental stress. Climate change, sea level rise, over-extraction of
   water and eutrophication together have increased vulnerability to regime
   shifts of ecosystems in the region. Regime shifts can have long-lasting
   effects on social-ecological resilience. Response diversity plays a
   central role in linking ecological, social, and financial systems and
   enhances resilience. Documenting regime shifts and associated feedbacks
   as well as the role of response diversity in social-ecological
   resilience and ecosystem goods and services in the region is essential
   for future sustainability. In this study, primarily, I have described
   mechanisms behind emergence of feedback loops at a time of regime shifts
   and its impacts on ecological resilience. Secondly, I have developed a
   framework for social-ecological resilience of freshwater ecosystems for
   southeast Asian region. Thirdly, I have provided current contexts of
   social-ecological resilience of two of the most productive freshwater
   ecosystems in the lower Mekong basin of southeast Asia: the Tonle Sap
   Lake (Cambodia) and the Vietnamese Mekong Delta. Finally, in conclusion,
   I have outlined the key roles response diversity plays in showing the
   effects of environmental stress and maintaining social-ecological
   resilience in the region.},

Title = {Vulnerability of Community-Based Forest Management to Climate
   Variability and Extremes: Emerging Insights on the Contribution of REDD},

Abstract = {Climate change spurs havoc on social-ecological system. People and
   places vulnerable to climate change have been the focus of many
   discussions. However, in the forestry sector, limited studies have been
   conducted that link human vulnerability to recent initiatives, such as
   reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation or REDD+,
   especially in highly vulnerable countries. Using case studies from the
   Philippines, this paper focuses on the vulnerability of two
   community-based forest management (CBFM) organizations, with and without
   REDD+ readiness intervention, to show the impacts of climate variability
   and extremes. Two balance-weighted approaches, the livelihood
   vulnerability index and the IPCC-framework, were used in the
   vulnerability assessments. Results revealed high vulnerability of both
   CBFM organizations, although Malitbog Upland Developers for Sustainable
   Association (MUDSA) livelihood vulnerability is largely aggravated by
   its exposure to disaster, climate variability and extremes,
   accessibility to health facilities and water supply. The long history of
   CBFM implementation in both organizations have minimal contribution in
   enhancing the adaptive capacity of members to cope with and adapt to
   climate change impacts. REDD+ (readiness), does not insure reduced
   vulnerability to climate change, unless sustainable livelihood is
   achieved. As the State controls forest resources, the rights of
   CBFM-organizations to commercially benefit from these resources are
   limited, a disincentive to the development of new and viable development
   programs in CBFM areas, such as REDD+. This also constrains the
   achievement of climate resiliency.},

Title = {Exploring transformative processes at the intersections of land, water

Journal = {ECOSYSTEMS AND PEOPLE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {19},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC 31},
Abstract = {The Tsitsa River catchment is a complex social-ecological system (cSES)
   in a rural area of the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa and the
   site of the Tsitsa Project (TP); a multi-stakeholder, transdisciplinary
   landscape restoration project aiming to improve sustainable livelihoods
   and ecological infrastructure. We investigated transformation mechanisms
   in a framing of multidimensional linkages, including the recognition of
   differentiated scales and levels. Linkages were analysed through the
   development of two vignettes: 1) a citizen technician employed to
   monitor sediment loads in rivers to inform landscape restoration
   activities (local scale); and 2) a senior government official
   responsible for (regional scale) operational and on-the-ground
   restoration initiatives. Vignette data were generated during a workshop,
   from TP researcher reflexivity, and interviews with the TP Catchment
   Coordinator and vignette subjects. Data were analysed and presented: i)
   as a heuristic diagram, ii) through a narrative, and iii) as a matrix
   table. Each analysis incorporated a different conceptualisation of scale
   in relation to four social processes related to transformative change:
   learning, agency, power and structure. Transformation is demonstrated
   and leverage points and areas of intractability for promoting and
   constraining future transformation towards social-ecological
   sustainability, were identified respectively. Further, we suggest that
   an understanding of transformative processes was enriched and nuanced by
   combining a triad of complementary analytical exercises. These allowed a
   focus on unique stories and contexts, but also the identification of
   generalisable patterns and mechanisms.},

Title = {Robust-yet-fragile nature of partly engineered social-ecological
   systems: a case study of coastal Bangladesh},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {22},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {Modern social-ecological systems are often partly engineered to enhance
   the robustness (or reduce the variance) of human welfare to
   environmental fluctuations over a foreseeable time horizon. Recent
   studies show, however, that subtle trade-offs are usually inherent in
   such efforts of enhancing short-term robustness. Managing variance on
   short time scales is likely to be associated with the buildup of hidden
   fragilities on longer time scales. Using a flood-prone social-ecological
   system (SES) of coastal Bangladesh as an example, this paper
   investigates some of the ways in which such robustness-fragility
   trade-offs can manifest. This SES has been extensively modified in the
   last few decades through the construction of large-scale flood
   protection structures (polders) and the introduction of commercial
   shrimp farming to enhance the robustness of food production to
   hydrological variability. Our case study analysis of the long-term
   changes in the SES shows that, although the modifications helped with
   stability in short time scales, the resulting changes also induced
   unforeseen problems such as infrastructure maintenance issues, land
   degradation and sinking, and exposure to market volatility. With this
   paper therefore we contribute to better understanding of the notion of
   robustness-fragility trade-offs by illustrating an exemplary case of the
   phenomenon in the engineered coastal environment context.},

Abstract = {The city of Saint-Louis is marked by recurrent floods, despite the
   decrease in rainfall. The town that grew downstream the vast plain where
   Senegalese-Mauritanian basin topography flattens considerably has
   experienced periodic flooding since its foundation. In 2003, the
   premature flooding of the Senegal River urged the Senegalese authorities
   to take the initiative to open a breach in the coastal sand strip of the
   ``Langue de Barbarie,{''} in order to evacuate the water surplus from
   the river to the ocean and therefore resolve forever the problem of
   river flooding. But the disruption of estuarine dynamics has led to a
   rapid expansion of this gap: a few meters wide at its excavation, it
   reaches over 2,700 m in August 2009. Moreover, 10 months after the
   widening of the gap, the old river mouth was completely closed. If the
   natural movement of a mouth can be observed on some major deltas in the
   world (even on the Senegal River in the past), this is here a true
   man-made relocation. Based on the statistical analysis of series of
   hydrological data, this article demonstrates on the one hand that
   climatic conditions in 2003 which generated a major flood is an anomaly
   detected in the sequence of dry climate variability observed in the
   Sahel. On the other hand, it studies the rapid evolution of this new
   mouth of the Senegal River and discusses some of impacts on the regional
   social-ecological system, in this sensitive Sahelian environment.},

Volume = {34},

Abstract = {Restoration of ecological structure and function of urban streams
   probably requires catchment-scale modification of drainage
   infrastructure, but such catchment-scale restoration attempts and their
   assessment are rare. They require stream ecologists to embrace the
   interdisciplinary challenges of studying the social-ecological systems
   that are urban catchments. We designed and monitored a catchment-scale
   experiment that involved the retrofit of urban stormwater infrastructure
   throughout an urban catchment to restore more natural hydrology, water
   quality, and consequently, ecological condition in the receiving stream.
   We worked with government authorities and the catchment community
   (residents and property owners) over several years to fund and implement
   289 stormwater retention systems. The length of the project allowed
   adaptation of the experimental design to expand the project's breadth
   and of retention-system design to match community needs and catchment
   context. Planning provisions are particularly important for such an
   experiment to ensure that the effect of dispersed experimental
   treatments is not countered by creation of new connected impervious
   areas elsewhere in the catchment. Catchment-scale experiments can help
   to transform policy and practice, but their success requires substantial
   effort and time to build trust among the numerous, diverse stakeholders
   of human-dominated urban ecosystems. Researchers need to be prepared to
   adopt an adaptive approach to the implementation of such experiments and
   to play the lead role in seeking funds for the implementation of the
   on-ground works necessary to underpin the experiment.},

Title = {Quantifying the effects of diverse private protected area management

Abstract = {The effects of management on ecosystem diversity, structure and function
   must be understood for the sustainable integration of conservation and
   development. A potential source of experimentation and learning in
   ecosystem management is the array of private protected areas worldwide.
   Autonomous management systems can be seen as natural experiments,
   presenting an opportunity to explore the consequences of manipulating
   ecosystem properties. By quantifying management diversity and developing
   an index of management intensity we assessed the ecological correlates
   of private protected area management within the savannah biome in South
   Africa. Management intensity is positively correlated with herbivore
   density, predator density and ecotourism lodge density and negatively
   with herbivore community heterogeneity, reintroduction success and
   primary productivity at the local protected area scale. However, these
   trade-offs are tantamount to functional diversity as different
   management systems play unique roles in the regional socio-ecological
   and socio-economic systems, which range from animal production centres
   high in commercial value to low density areas that may sustain landscape
   processes. Furthermore, fenced private protected areas are necessary to
   safeguard rare species that cannot sustain viable populations in altered
   ecosystems. Thus, when considered at the regional scale, a private
   protected area network that constitutes a patchwork of management
   systems will create a coincident conservation and production landscape.
   We suggest that maintaining management heterogeneity will provide net
   benefits to biodiversity and potentially galvanize locally sustainable,
   wildlife-based economies.},

Title = {Limited use of transformative adaptation in response to
   social-ecological shifts driven by climate change},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {25},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Climate change is increasingly driving fundamental shifts in ecosystems,
   land use, and human livelihoods. Because of these rapid shifts, some
   conventional adaptation strategies may have limited success in reducing
   the impact of climate change. In some circumstances, there will be a
   need for considering transformative changes as part of adaptation
   strategies that can provide long-term benefits and address the root
   causes of vulnerability. However, to date, there is limited
   understanding of how societies respond to, or drive, transformative
   changes in social-ecological systems due to climate change impact. We
   reviewed 60 empirical case studies of shifts in trajectories of
   social-ecological systems in tropical and subtropical countries that
   were driven by climate change to identify how societies responded to
   these shifts and the extent to which societies used transformative
   adaptation as part of this response. In the case studies, we identified
   three types of shifts driven by climate change depending on whether the
   shift occurred in the ecological, social, or social-ecological system.
   Climate change shifted the trajectories of social-ecological systems by
   altering the feedback loops connecting soil, water, or vegetation
   conditions with peoples livelihoods and well-being. In response to these
   shifts, people adjusted land use policies and practices, but only
   one-quarter of the reported adaptation actions included transformative
   adaptation. A more holistic understanding of how climate change modifies
   interactions in social-ecological systems and leads to shifts in system
   trajectories could help identify appropriate adaptation responses,
   including transformative adaptation, that provide long-term and
   sustainable benefits.},

Month = {FEB 15},
Abstract = {Poverty alleviation linked to agricultural intensification has been
   achieved in many regions but there is often only limited understanding
   of the impacts on ecological dynamics. A central need is to observe long
   term changes in regulating and supporting services as the basis for
   assessing the likelihood of sustainable agriculture or ecological
   collapse. We show how the analyses of 55 time-series of social, economic
   and ecological conditions can provide an evolutionary perspective for
   the modern Lower Yangtze River Basin region since the 1950s with
   powerful insights about the sustainability of modern ecosystem services.
   Increasing trends in provisioning ecosystem services within the region
   over the past 60 years reflect economic growth and successful poverty
   alleviation but are paralleled by steep losses in a range of regulating
   ecosystem services mainly since the 1980s. Increasing connectedness
   across the social and ecological domains after 1985 points to a greater
   uniformity in the drivers of the rural economy. Regime shifts and
   heightened levels of variability since the 1970s in local ecosystem
   services indicate progressive loss of resilience across the region. Of
   special concern are water quality services that have already passed
   critical transitions in several areas. Viewed collectively, our results
   suggest that the regional social-ecological system passed a tipping
   point in the late 1970s and is now in a transient phase heading towards
   a new steady state. However, the long-term relationship between economic
   growth and ecological degradation shows no sign of decoupling as
   demanded by the need to reverse an unsustainable trajectory. (C) 2014

Abstract = {Climate is changing at an unprecedented rate with impacts being felt in
   social and ecological systems around the world. Opportunities for
   building climate resilience of the social-ecological system surrounding
   freshwater areas are assessed using the aquatic monitoring and reporting
   programs of Muskoka River Watershed (Ontario, Canada) as a case study. A
   three-step study design was used: establishment of a knowledge baseline
   (i.e., what has been done), confirmation of the baseline to ensure
   perspectives that emerged were inclusive of multiple stakeholders (i.e.,
   broadly applicable) and an exploratory workshop to disseminate
   recommendations and discuss implementation with key stakeholders. Two
   themes are discussed: the strengthening of watershed-scale monitoring
   approaches, and improved communication with stakeholders (e.g., through
   `state of the watershed' reporting). This study offers an evaluation of
   watershed-scale aquatic monitoring and reporting and provides concrete
   examples from the case study. We test a new process for refining,
   selecting, or prioritizing indicators for aquatic monitoring. Cumulative
   effects assessment and monitoring (CEAM) is considered as the suggested
   monitoring approach at a watershed-scale. Recommendations for developing
   CEAM in the Muskoka River Watershed include considerations for selection
   of monitoring indicators, consistent communication of indicators, and
   implementing a metadatabase. Ways to enhance education of, and
   engagement with, local stakeholders through improved `state of the
   watershed' report cards are highlighted. Resilience is strengthened by
   addressing two goals in the case study: engaging with the community and
   improving knowledge of stressor-effect relationships in the watershed
   via stronger aquatic monitoring.},

Number = {4},
Abstract = {This Special Feature, ``Nudging Evolution? Critical Exploration of the
   Potential and Limitations of the Concept of Institutional Fit for the
   Study and Adaptive Management of Social-Ecological Systems,{''} aims to
   contribute toward the development of social theory and social research
   methods for the study of social-ecological system dynamics. Our
   objective is to help strengthen the academic discourse concerning if,
   and if so, how, to what extent, and in what concrete ways the concept of
   institutional ``fit{''} might play a role in helping to develop better
   understanding of the social components of interlinkages between the
   socioeconomic-cultural and ecological dynamics of social-ecological
   systems. Two clearly discernible patterns provide a map of this Special
   Feature: (1) One pattern is the authors' positions regarding the place
   and role of normativity within their studies and assessment of
   institutional fit. Some place this at the center of their studies,
   exploring phenomena endogenous to the process of defining what
   constitutes institutional fit, whereas others take the formation of
   norms as a phenomenon exogenous to their study. (2) Another pattern is
   the type of studies presented: critiques and elaborations of the theory,
   methods for judging qualities of fit, and/or applied case studies using
   the concept. As a body of work, these contributions highlight that
   self-understanding of social-ecological place, whether explicit or
   implicit, constitutes an important part of the study object, i. e., the
   role of institutions in social-ecological systems, and that this is, at
   the same time, a crucial point of reference for the scholar wishing to
   evaluate what constitutes institutional fit and how it might be brought
   into being.},

Title = {Like Little Lagoons: The Contribution of <i>Valli da Pesca</i> to the

Year = {2023},
Volume = {46},

Abstract = {The Venice Lagoon social-ecological system is characterized by a strong
   relationship between the natural environment and human activities. This
   is especially noticeable in the aquaculture and hunting reserves of the
   lagoon, locally known as valli da pesca. Previous works about ecosystem
   services (ESs) in the Venice Lagoon focused on the so-called ``open
   lagoon,{''} overlooking the role of the valli da pesca. Nonetheless,
   despite being completely managed ecosystems, the valli da pesca have
   conserved typical elements of transitional water environments that the
   other parts of the lagoon have lost. By evaluating nine ESs using a
   spatially explicit approach, we found that the valli da pesca, despite
   covering 17\% of the surface, are contributing for 38\% of the ESs total
   capacity, and for 24\% of the ESs total flow, in comparison with the
   open part of the lagoon. Moreover, the management that aims to maximize
   in a perspective of sustainability of some provisioning ESs, such as
   extensive aquaculture, can positively influence the presence of factors
   on which other ESs capacity is also based. As a result, the open lagoon
   benefits from a sort of spill-over effect for lifecycle support,
   hunting, and cultural ESs such as tourism, information for cognitive
   development, and birdwatching. Such significant contributions could be
   endangered in the context of a lagoon subjected to increasing pressures
   from anthropic activities where even adaptations to impacts, as well as
   to climate change and sea-level rise effects, in the long run will
   modify the lagoon hydrodynamics and the sea-lagoon connectivity,
   threatening the valli da pesca and so their ESs supply.},

Abstract = {Wetlands are complex social-ecological systems, which provide both

   functional wetlands be restored and sustainably managed as
   social-ecological systems in strongly state-centric, top-down governance
   contexts, such as in former Soviet republics? Using three case studies
   of wetland restoration and management for ecosystem functionality,
   biodiversity conservation, and human livelihoods, we employ a complex
   systems approach to analyze key governance and management dynamics
   underpinning initiatives toward sustainable wetlands in Belarus. We
   identified five core processes, namely, planning, garnering stakeholder
   support, obtaining key inputs (financial, human, material,
   technological, fixed capital), implementing core activities, and
   integrating learning and knowledge cycles. Key constraints concerned
   institutional hierarchies, onerous regulations, ``negativism,{''} and
   financing difficulties. Strategies relating to perception management,
   risk mitigation, and learning are identified as key to enabling
   beneficial feedback loops relating to core processes. Although
   path-dependent societal dynamics of the Soviet era continue to influence
   wetland systems, combinations of social and ecological crises created
   windows of opportunity for active participation among nongovernmental
   actors. Major opportunities for enabling emergent management approaches
   included identification of confluences of interest amongst stakeholders,
   as well as the continued mutual integration of Belarus with the
   international community.},

Abstract = {Managing complex social-ecological systems in an era of rapid climate
   change and changing human pressures represents a major challenge in
   sustainability science. The Sierra Nevada, USA is a large
   social-ecological system facing a tipping point that could result in
   major ecosystem changes. A century of fire suppression and climate
   change have set the stage for mega-disturbances that threaten
   biodiversity, human life and values, ecosystem services, and forest
   persistence. Stakeholders face multidimensional and often contentious
   trade-offs with costs and benefits that can be mismatched in space and
   time. If compromises cannot be reached, the status quo is likely to
   continue, resulting in the conversion of large portions of a 100 000
   km(2) predominately mixed-conifer forest ecosystem to a
   chaparral-dominated ecosystem. We describe the outcomes of a
   continuation of the ecological status quo on biodiversity, cultural
   history, fire management, recreational value, and climate control,
   including indirect effects on water and food security and recreation.
   The social-ecological ramifications of such a future are undesirable for
   most stakeholders. Therefore, we contend that forest management
   conflicts should be framed in terms of the cost of failure of
   negotiations among stakeholders. Specifically, negotiations may benefit
   from (1) stakeholders quantifying their definitions of success and
   failure, (2) quantification of trade-offs and recognition of their
   multidimensionality, and (3) allowing for solutions that are
   heterogeneous in space and time. This approach may help stakeholders
   navigate the wicked problem of managing Sierra Nevada forests and other
   complex social-ecological systems.},

Abstract = {Governing common pool resources (CPR) in the face of disturbances such
   as globalization and climate change is challenging. The outcome of any
   CPR governance regime is the influenced by local combinations of social,
   institutional, and biophysical factors, as well as cross-scale
   interdependencies. In this study, we take a step towards understanding
   multiple-causation of CPR outcomes by analyzing (1) the co-occurrence of
   design principles (DPs) by activity (irrigation, fishery and forestry),
   and (2) the combination(s) of DPs leading to social and ecological
   success. We analyzed 69 cases pertaining to three different activities:
   irrigation, fishery, and forestry. We find that the importance of the
   design principles is dependent upon the natural and hard human made
   infrastructure (i.e. canals, equipment, vessels etc.). For example,
   clearly defined social boundaries are important when the natural
   infrastructure is highly mobile (i.e. tuna fish), while monitoring is
   more important when the natural infrastructure is more static (i.e.
   forests or water contained within an irrigation system). However, we
   also find that congruence between local conditions and rules and
   proportionality between investment and extraction are key for CPR
   success independent from the natural and human hard made infrastructure.
   We further provide new visualization techniques for co-occurrence
   patterns and add to qualitative comparative analysis by introducing a
   reliability metric to deal with a large meta-analysis dataset on
   secondary data where information is missing or uncertain.},

Abstract = {Alaska is among the fastest warming places on Earth, and the Interior
   region is warming the most statewide. Significant regional-scale
   ecosystem services disruptions are affecting Alaska Natives' subsistence
   hunting and harvest success. The well-being of rural native communities
   is still highly dependent on access and ability to harvest wild foods
   such as salmon and moose (Alces alces gigas) among many others. Over the
   last decade communities in the Koyukuk-Middle Yukon (KMY) region of
   Interior Alaska report an inability to satisfy their needs for
   harvesting moose before the hunting season closes, citing warmer falls,
   changing precipitation and water levels, and the regulatory framework as
   primary causes. Through the integration of ethnographic methods to
   record indigenous observations and understanding of climate (IC) with
   analysis of meteorological data, we provide a comprehensive picture of
   vulnerability to recent warming trends in the Koyukuk-Middle Yukon
   region of Interior Alaska, one that captures more than statistical
   analysis of ``norms{''} can provide. We will demonstrate how low
   exposure resulting in a small shift in seasonality has truly socially
   significant effects to people ``on the ground{''} when community
   sensitivity is high because of the convergence of multiple
   social-ecological stressors. In this case, a seemingly small climatic
   exposure when combined with high social-ecological system sensitivity
   results in vulnerability to this climate change-related seasonality
   shift because of: (a) the effects on moose and the social-ecological
   dynamics of the system, and (b) the importance of this time of the year
   to meeting annual subsistence needs. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Assessing the sustainability of freshwater systems: A critical review of
   composite indicators},
Journal = {AMBIO},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {45},
Number = {7},
Pages = {765-780},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Quantitative indicators are a common means of assessing the complex
   dimensions of a sustainable freshwater system, and framing scientific
   knowledge for policy and decision makers. There is an abundance of
   indicators in use, but considerable variation in terms of what is being
   measured and how indicators are applied, making it difficult for
   end-users to identify suitable assessment methods. We review 95
   water-related indices and analyze them along their normative,
   procedural, and systemic dimensions to better understand how problems
   are being defined, highlight overlaps and differences, and identify the
   context(s) in which a particular index is useful. We also analyze the
   intended use, end-users, and geographic scale of application for each
   index. We find that risk assessment is the most common application (n =
   25), with indices in this group typically focusing either on hazard
   identification (biophysical assessments) or vulnerability of human
   populations. Indices that measure freshwater ecological health are not
   explicitly linking these indicators to ecosystem services, and in fact
   the concept of ecosystem services is rarely (n = 3) used for indicator
   selection. Resource managers are the most common group of intended
   end-users (n = 25), but while 28 indices involved consultation with
   potential end-users, 11 did not specify an intended use. We conclude
   that indices can be applied as solution-oriented tools, evaluating
   scenarios and identifying tradeoffs among services and beneficiaries,
   rather than only assessing and monitoring existing conditions. Finally,
   earlier engagement of end-users is recommended to help researchers find
   the right balance among indices' salience, legitimacy, and credibility
   and thus improve their decision relevance.},

Title = {The role of multi-functionality in social preferences toward semi-arid
   rural landscapes: An ecosystem service approach},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {19-20},
Pages = {136-146},
Month = {MAY-JUN},
Abstract = {The present study analyzes the relationship between landscape
   multi-functionality and social preferences toward Mediterranean
   landscapes in terms of monetary and non-monetary techniques. Twenty
   landscape views were selected as representative of the landscape units
   characterizing Nacimiento and Adra semi-arid watersheds (southeastern
   Spain). Face-to-face questionnaires were used to assess social factors
   that influence willingness to pay for aesthetic landscape enjoyment (use
   value) and landscape conservation (non-use value). Meanwhile, an expert
   focus group analyzed the capacity of the selected semi-arid ecosystems
   for supplying services to society. The favorite landscape views mainly
   contained steeper reliefs, water flows, and traditional human
   activities. Our results suggest a strong positive effect between
   respondents' place attachment and the level of support for landscape
   conservation. Respondents were more willing to pay for the conservation
   of semi-arid rural landscapes when their sense of belonging was greater.
   We also found that multi-functional landscapes, which provide higher
   numbers of regulating and cultural services, were also preferred in
   terms of their visual quality (use value). Additionally, they had more
   social support for their conservation (non-use value). The conversion of
   multi-functional landscapes to mono-functional ones disturbs the
   stability of rural areas, their capacity to provide other ecosystem
   services, and the social support toward their preservation. To reverse
   this tendency, two major ideas should be emphasized. The first is the
   necessity of considering the ecological components and processes behind
   landscapes, and the second is the role of the local population on rural
   landscape conservation. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Comparison between best-response dynamics and replicator dynamics in a
   social-ecological model of lake eutrophication},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {509},
Month = {JAN 21},
Abstract = {Social-ecological models are often used to investigate the mutual
   interactions between an ecological system and human behaviour at a
   collective level. The social system is widely represented either by the
   replicator dynamics or by the best-response dynamics. We investigate the
   consequences of choosing one or the other with the example of a
   social-ecological model for eutrophication in shallow lakes, where the
   anthropogenic discharge of pollutants into the water is determined by a
   behavioural model using the replicator or a best-response dynamics. We
   discuss a fundamental difference between the replicator dynamics and the
   logit formulation of the best-response dynamics. This fundamental
   difference results in a different number of equilibria. We show that the
   replicator equation is a limit case of the best-response model, when
   agents are assumed to behave with infinite rationality. If agents act
   less rationally in the model using the best-response dynamics, the
   correspondence with the model using the replicator dynamics decreases.
   Finally, we show that sustained oscillations observed in both cases may
   differ substantially. The replicator dynamics makes the amplitude of the
   limit cycle become larger and makes the system come closer to full
   cooperation or full defection. Thus, the dynamics along the limit cycle
   imply a different risk for the system to be pushed by a perturbation
   into a desirable or an undesirable outcome depending on the
   socioeconomic dynamics assumed in the model. When analyzing
   social-ecological models, the choice of a socioeconomic dynamics is
   often little justified but our results show that it may have dramatic
   impacts on the coupled human-environment system. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {Transfers of vulnerability through adaptation plan implementation: an
   analysis based on networks of feedback control loops},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {25},
Number = {2},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {With the increasing number of adaptation plans being generated across
   the world at multiple scales and levels of organization, the issue of
   coordination among plans is emerging as a significant challenge. We
   focus on how lack of coordination may constrain their efficiency as a
   result of potential transfers of vulnerability. This paper focuses on
   interdependencies between autonomous feedback control loops that
   represent adaptation processes and makes the link between autonomous
   action and (social-ecological) system levels. These interdependencies
   allow changes in vulnerability of one adaptation actor as a consequence
   of the reduction of vulnerability of another actor. We refer to the
   processes behind such changes as ``vulnerability transfers{''} and
   suggest the need for their identification so that actors may make
   agreements to address them explicitly. A thorough analysis of each step
   involved in a feedback control loop enables the identification of
   potential interdependencies, leading to seven basic types of
   vulnerability transfer. The analysis of example cases of observed
   transfers of vulnerability in three coastal case studies then
   demonstrate the suitability of feedback control loop networks to assess,
   ex-ante, potential vulnerability transfers. The example cases feature
   all types of theoretically possible vulnerability transfers. Initial
   empirical investigation showcases the relative importance of shared
   infrastructures in generating transfers of vulnerability. It also helps
   to reveal forgotten links to avoid decreasing efficiency of adaptation
   processes beyond each autonomous agent's jurisdiction. Our
   representation contributes to a more comprehensive ex-ante
   identification of transfers and hence the possibility to discuss and
   manage them.},

Title = {Social-Ecological Risk and Vulnerability to Flooding and Erosion along

Journal = {COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {50},
Number = {1},
Pages = {45-61},
Month = {JAN 21},
Abstract = {The Laurentian Great Lakes system holds approximately 20\% of the
   world's available surface freshwater and represents an immense economic
   engine for the region. Lake Erie, one of the five North American Great
   Lakes is classified as highly stressed and deteriorating with
   significant flooding and erosion issues stemming from record-high water
   levels. This study adapts a well-established oceanic coastal
   vulnerability index to estimate impacts and risks of lake-level rise on
   the Ohio portion of Lake Erie coastal social-ecological system. The
   authors worked closely with coastal engineers, planners, and other
   practitioners associated with the Ohio Department of Natural Resources
   (ODNR) and the Office of Coastal Management (OCM) to help adapt a
   scientifically-grounded framework for natural resource and policy
   decision making. Overall, place-based risk and vulnerability to flooding
   and erosion necessitates an integrated approach that combines
   socio-economic, built-environment, political boundaries, and
   bio-physical characteristics. While most of the integrated methodologies
   are focused on the oceanic coasts at the county scale, this research
   presents a model for Lake Erie-relevant variables at the
   higher-resolution census-tract unit of analysis and a coastal
   vulnerability index at 100-foot intervals along the coastline for four
   decades and each season. The result is both a foundation for Ohio's
   Department of Natural Resources, Office of Coastal Management to
   identify scientifically-informed, place-based priority management areas
   for flooding and erosion, as well as a methodological roadmap to adapt
   the Coastal and Place Vulnerability Indices to the other Great Lakes'
   states and provincial shorelines.},

Title = {The role of <i>Nucularia perrinii</i> Batt. (Chenopodiaceae) in the
   camel-based Sahrawi social-ecological system},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ETHNOBIOLOGY AND ETHNOMEDICINE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {13},
Month = {FEB 8},
Abstract = {Background: Pastoral social-ecological systems (SESs) are adaptive and
   complex systems rooted in the extensive exploitation of forage plants
   for livestock-based livelihoods and culture. There are species and
   relations that are foundational to the existence of these SESs.
   Nucularia perrinii Batt. (Chenopodiaceae) is an endemic halophyte plant
   of central and western Sahara seldom cited in the scientific literature.
   The objective of this study was to investigate the role of this plant in
   the SES of the Sahrawi camel nomads of Western Sahara.
   Methods: The data analyzed were collected in the Sahrawi refugee camps
   of Algeria and in Western Sahara between 2006 and 2010. Fieldwork
   included semi-structured (n = 38) and retrospective (n = 12) interviews
   with Sahrawi refugees, nomads, and camel owners about N. perrinii and
   associated topics (e.g. distribution, importance for camels, camel
   diseases, associated grazing practices, other forage plants, etc.).
   Results: Askaf, as the Sahrawi call the plant, is crucial to camels'
   survival, providing salts and water even during dry spells. It holds a
   pivotal role in the Sahrawi culture, defining the geographical
   boundaries of the Sahrawi SES and relating the grazing territory with
   the taste it gives to camel milk, which support the inclusion of askaf
   as a main element of Sahrawi cultural identity.
   Conclusions: We argue that N. perrinii ties the ecology of the western
   Sahara desert with camel husbandry and associated livelihoods, and
   further with the culture and worldview of the Sahrawi nomads. We stress
   the keystone role that some forage plants may have in extensive pastoral
   SESs worldwide.},

Title = {California shellfish farmers: Perceptions of changing ocean conditions
   and strategies for adaptive capacity},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {225},
Month = {JUN 15},
Abstract = {Coastal communities along the U.S. West Coast experience a myriad of
   environmental stressors, including exposure to low pH waters exacerbated
   by ocean acidification (OA). This can result in ecological and social
   consequences, making necessary the exploration and support for locally
   relevant strategies to adapt to OA and other environmental changes. The
   shellfish aquaculture industry along the West Coast is particularly
   vulnerable to OA, given the negative effects of low pH on shellfish
   survival and growth. As such, the social-ecological system exemplified
   by this industry serves as an opportunity to identify and address
   strategies for local adaptation. Through interviews conducted with West
   Coast shellfish farm owners and managers ('growers'), we investigate
   perceptions of OA and environmental change and identify specific
   strategies for adaptation. We find that growers are concerned about OA,
   among many other environmental stressors such as marine pathogens and
   water temperature. However, growers are often unable to attribute
   changes in shellfish survival or health to these environmental factors
   due to a lack of data and the resources and network required to acquire
   and interpret these data. From these interviews, we identify a list of
   adaptive strategies growers employ or would like to employ to improve
   their overall adaptive capacity to multiple stressors (environmental,
   economic, political), which together, allow farms to weather periods of
   OA-induced stress more effectively. Very few studies to date have
   identified specific adaptive strategies derived directly from the
   communities being impacted. This work therefore fills a gap in the
   literature on adaptive capacity by amplifying the voices of those on the
   front lines of climate change and identifying explicit pathways for
   adaptation.},

Title = {Transforming (perceived) rigidity in environmental law through adaptive
   governance: a case of Endangered Species Act implementation},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {22},
Number = {4},
Abstract = {The Endangered Species Act (ESA) is often portrayed as a major source of
   instability and crisis in river basins of the U.S. West, where the needs
   of listed fish species frequently clash with agriculture dependent on
   federal irrigation projects subject to ESA Section 7 prohibitions on
   federal agency actions likely to jeopardize listed species or adversely
   modify critical habitat. Scholarship on Section 7 characterizes the
   process as unwaveringly rigid, the legal ``hammer{''} forcing federal
   agencies to consider endangered species' needs when proposing operations
   and management plans for federally funded irrigation. In this paper, we
   identify barriers to an integrated approach to Section 7 implementation
   and characterize a set of strategies for overcoming its rigidity that
   may have broader applicability. We draw on lessons derived from the
   Klamath Basin along the Oregon-California border, where cross-scale
   processes and venues involving interagency collaboration among leaders
   in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the National Marine Fisheries
   Service, and the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation supported efforts to replace
   an ecologically and socially fragmented Upper Basin/Lower Basin approach
   to ESA implementation fraught with conflict. The result was the nation's
   first joint biological opinion (BiOp), which effectively
   institutionalized an adaptive, flexible, integrated approach to water
   sharing among competing interests. Keys to success included existing
   collaborative capacity related to shifting stakeholder networks, trust,
   and relationships and a shift in local agency culture facilitated by
   empathic leadership leading to a greater sense of shared responsibility
   for Section 7 compliance. A collaborative hydrologic modeling process
   enhanced participatory capacity, facilitated transformative social and
   technical learning, and cultivated greater understanding of the
   social-ecological system among key stakeholders. The 2013 joint BiOp
   exemplifies both governmental capacity for flexibility and evolution
   within the constraints of formal law and the potential for greater
   integration among federal agencies and between federal agencies and
   stakeholders involved in ESA implementation.},

Abstract = {We use the fire ecology and biogeographical patterns of Callitris
   intratropica, a fire-sensitive conifer, and the Asian water buffalo
   (Bubalus bubalis), an introduced mega-herbivore, to examine the
   hypothesis that the continuation of Aboriginal burning and cultural
   integration of buffalo contribute to greater savanna heterogeneity and
   diversity in central Arnhem Land (CAL) than Kakadu National Park (KNP).
   The `Stone Country' of the Arnhem Plateau, extending from KNP to CAL, is
   a globally renowned social-ecological system, managed for millennia by
   Bininj-Kunwok Aboriginal clans. Regional species declines have been
   attributed to the cessation of patchy burning by Aborigines. Whereas the
   KNP Stone Country is a modern wilderness, managed through prescribed
   burning and buffalo eradication, CAL remains a stronghold for Aboriginal
   management where buffalo have been culturally integrated. We surveyed
   the plant community and the presence of buffalo tracks among intact and
   fire-damaged C. intratropica groves and the savanna matrix in KNP and
   CAL. Aerial surveys of C. intratropica grove condition were used to
   examine the composition of savanna vegetation across the Stone Country.
   The plant community in intact C. intratropica groves had higher stem
   counts of shrubs and small trees and higher proportions of
   fire-sensitive plant species than degraded groves and the savanna
   matrix. A higher proportion of intact C. intratropica groves in CAL
   therefore indicated greater gamma diversity and habitat heterogeneity
   than the KNP Stone Country. Interactions among buffalo, fire, and C.
   intratropica suggested that buffalo also contributed to these patterns.
   Our results suggest linkages between ecological and cultural integrity
   at broad spatial scales across a complex landscape. Buffalo may provide
   a tool for mitigating destructive fires; however, their interactions
   require further study. Sustainability in the Stone Country depends upon
   adaptive management that rehabilitates the coupling of indigenous
   culture, disturbance, and natural resources.},

Title = {On the social dynamics of moisture recycling},

Year = {2018},

Abstract = {The biophysical phenomenon of terrestrial moisture recycling connects
   distant regions via the atmospheric branch of the water cycle. This
   process, whereby the land surface mediates evaporation to the atmosphere
   and the precipitation that falls downwind, is increasingly
   well-understood. However, recent studies highlight a need to consider an
   important and often missing dimension - the social. Here, we explore the
   social dynamics of three case study countries with strong terrestrial
   moisture recycling: Mongolia, Niger, and Bolivia. We first use the
   WAM-2layers moisture tracking scheme and ERA-Interim climate reanalysis,
   to calculate the evaporation sources for each country's precipitation,
   a.k.a. the precipitationshed. Second, we examine the social aspects of
   source and sink regions, using economic, food security, and land-use
   data. Third, we perform a literature review of relevant economic links,
   land-use policies, and land-use change for each country and its
   evaporation sources. The moisture-recycling analysis reveals that
   Mongolia, Niger, and Bolivia recycle 13, 9, and 18\% of their own
   moisture, respectively. Our analysis of social aspects suggests
   considerable heterogeneity in the social characteristics within each
   country relative to the societies in its corresponding evaporation
   sources. We synthesize our case studies and develop a set of three
   system archetypes that capture the core features of the
   moisturerecycling social-ecological systems (MRSESs): isolated,
   regional, and tele-coupled systems. Our key results are as follows: (a)
   geophysical tele-connections of atmospheric moisture are complemented by
   social tele-couplings forming feedback loops, and consequently, complex
   adaptive systems; (b) the heterogeneity of the social dynamics among our
   case studies renders broad generalization difficult and highlights the
   need for nuanced individual analysis; and, (c) there does not appear to
   be a single desirable or undesirable MRSES, with each archetype
   associated with benefits and disadvantages. This exploration of the
   social dimensions of moisture recycling is part of an extension of the
   emerging discipline of socio-hydrology and a suggestion for further
   exploration of new disciplines such as socio-meteorology or
   socio-climatology, within which the Earth system is considered as a
   coevolutionary social-ecological system.},

Title = {Bridging science and traditional knowledge to assess cumulative impacts

Journal = {ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL},

Volume = {102},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Cumulative environmental impacts driven by anthropogenic stressors lead
   to disproportionate effects on indigenous communities that are reliant
   on land and water resources. Understanding and counteracting these
   effects requires knowledge from multiple sources. Yet the combined use
   of Traditional Knowledge (TK) and Scientific Knowledge (SK) has both
   technical and philosophical hurdles to overcome, and suffers from
   inherently imbalanced power dynamics that can disfavour the very
   communities it intends to benefit. In this article, we present a
   `two-eyed seeing' approach for co-producing and blending knowledge about
   ecosystem health by using an adapted Bayesian Belief Network for the
   Slave River and Delta region in Canada's Northwest Territories. We
   highlight how bridging TM and SK with a combination of field data,
   interview transcripts, existing models, and expert judgement can address
   key questions about ecosystem health when considerable uncertainty
   exists. SK indicators (e.g., bird counts, mercury in fish, water depth)
   were graded as moderate, whereas TM indicators (e.g., bird usage, fish
   aesthetics, changes to water flow) were graded as being poor in
   comparison to the past. SK indicators were predominantly spatial (i.e.,
   comparing to other locations) while the TK indicators were predominantly
   temporal (i.e., comparing across time). After being populated by 16
   experts (local harvesters, Elders, governmental representatives, and
   scientists) using both TK and SK, the model output reported low
   probabilities that the social-ecological system is healthy as it used to
   be. We argue that it is novel and important to bridge TM and SK to
   address the challenges of environmental change such as the cumulative
   impacts of multiple stressors on ecosystems and the services they
   provide. This study presents a critical social-ecological tool for
   widening the evidence-base to a more holistic understanding of the
   system dynamics of multiple environmental stressors in ecosystems and
   for developing more effective knowledge-inclusive partnerships between
   indigenous communities, researchers and policy decision-makers. This
   represents new transformational empirical insights into how wider
   knowledge discourses can contribute to more effective adaptive
   co-management governance practices and solutions for the resilience and
   sustainability of ecosystems in Northern Canada and other parts of the
   world with strong indigenous land tenure. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE CITIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {4},
Month = {JUL 11},
Abstract = {The current global situation with a dominant economic development model
   producing social inequality, increment and intensification of
   urbanization has generated severe environmental degradation and an
   associated increase in the likelihood of pandemics. New strategies that
   strengthen sustainable food production are urgent in highly unequal
   countries as Mexico. In Mexico City, the most populated city of the
   country, a wetland system, named Xochimilco, still holds chinampas, a
   unique and ingenious food system dating from pre-Hispanic times. These
   days chinampas are the best example of urban sustainable agriculture
   production. Unfortunately, this system is under threat due to
   urbanization and industrial land-use changes. Among the strategies to
   promote sustainable modes of production and consumption is eco or green
   labeling, consisting of a voluntary environmental certification
   approach, and marketing and advertising tool, that can change producers'
   and consumers' behavior toward long-term sustainability. Although widely
   used, the benefits of green labels for producers are not always
   realized. This study aimed to learn more about the agro-ecological
   production process and commercialization challenges in Xochimilco and
   San Gregorio Atlapulco in Southern Mexico City to understand chinampa
   producers' needs and determine whether a green label can offer solutions
   in this vulnerable socio-ecological system, particularly suffering the
   effects of the COVID-19 pandemics. For this, a literature review and
   producers' mental model analysis based on network theory, were
   developed. Results show that non-resolved issues such as
   commercialization problems, consumers' unwillingness to pay a fair
   price, loss of healthy soil, and degraded water quality used for
   irrigation persist and can affect the benefits of a green label
   including to improve chinampa production and farmers' income. Farmers'
   current necessities comprised increasing profits, receiving financial
   advice to set prices of agro-ecological vegetables and production costs,
   among others. Under the current production and commercialization
   scenarios complying with the assessment cost of certification will be
   difficult for most producers; then, implementing the green label would
   probably fail to fulfill the benefits. Attending to former and
   persistent conflicts and satisfying chinampa producers' neglected
   necessities are essential before implementing any program.},

Abstract = {Effective approaches towards sustainability need to be informed by a
   diverse array of stakeholder perspectives. However, capturing these
   perspectives in a way that can be integrated with other forms of
   knowledge can represent a challenge. Here we present the first
   application of the conceptual framework of the Intergovernmental
   Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES)
   to a participatory assessment of local perspectives on nature, people
   and sustainability on Mount Kilimanjaro, Tanzania. This assessment was
   organized in the form of a participatory workshop with five different
   groups of stakeholders. Following this framework, we assembled
   information on the state of and trends in species diversity, Nature's
   Contributions to People (NCP), and on the main drivers of changes in
   species and habitats. Additionally, we gathered perspectives on the
   needs and opportunities for the sustainable management and conservation
   of natural resources from the individual to the international level. The
   various stakeholders agreed that both the condition and extent of the
   various habitats and NCP are declining. In line with available
   knowledge, the key direct drivers of change mentioned by the workshop
   participants were land use and climate change, whereas human population
   growth was singled out as the most important indirect driver. The most
   frequently suggested measures to address the observed decline in species
   diversity and its drivers were related to land and water management and
   to education and awareness raising. Yet, the stakeholder groups differed
   in the measures they suggested. The willingness of a diversity of
   knowledge holders to systematically engage in a structured discussion
   around all the elements of the IPBES framework provides support for its
   applicability in participatory workshops aimed at capturing nuanced and
   context-based perspectives on social-ecological systems from informed
   stakeholders. The application of the IPBES framework enabled the
   comparability needed for developing narratives of stakeholder visions
   that can help identify new pathways towards sustainability and guide
   planning while retaining the context-based nuances that remain
   unresolved with non-participatory methods. Read the free Plain Language

Title = {A review of vulnerability indicators for deltaic social-ecological
   systems},

Abstract = {The sustainability of deltas worldwide is under threat due to the
   consequences of global environmental change (including climate change)
   and human interventions in deltaic landscapes. Understanding these
   systems is becoming increasingly important to assess threats to and
   opportunities for long-term sustainable development. Here, we propose a
   simplified, yet inclusive social-ecological system (SES)-centered risk
   and vulnerability framework and a list of indicators proven to be useful
   in past delta assessments. In total, 236 indicators were identified
   through a structured review of peer-reviewed literature performed for
   three globally relevant deltas-the Mekong, the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna
   and the Amazon. These are meant to serve as a preliminary ``library{''}
   of potential indicators to be used for future vulnerability assessments.
   Based on the reviewed studies, we identified disparities in the
   availability of indicators to populate some of the vulnerability domains
   of the proposed framework, as comprehensive social-ecological
   assessments were seldom implemented in the past. Even in assessments
   explicitly aiming to capture both the social and the ecological system,
   there were many more indicators for social susceptibility and
   coping/adaptive capacities as compared to those relevant for
   characterizing ecosystem susceptibility or robustness. Moreover, there
   is a lack of multi-hazard approaches accounting for the specific
   vulnerability profile of sub-delta areas. We advocate for more
   comprehensive, truly social-ecological assessments which respond to
   multi-hazard settings and recognize within-delta differences in
   vulnerability and risk. Such assessments could make use of the proposed
   framework and list of indicators as a starting point and amend it with
   new indicators that would allow capturing the complexity as well as the
   multi-hazard exposure in a typical delta SES.},

Title = {Exploring human-nature interaction on the coastal floodplain in the

   systems framework},

Abstract = {This study diagnoses temporal and spatial variations in the performance
   of different social-ecological systems (SES) in coastal floodplain
   management in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta. We go beyond common pool
   resource management problems and address the management of local public
   goods. In the assessment, we consider recent developments in the
   framework initially developed by Elinor Ostrom. The main variables of
   the framework that we use are resource systems, the environment, the
   governance system and actors. The focal SES is defined based on guiding
   questions relating to the definition of the key problem, system
   boundaries, and action situations. According to our results, the
   performance of resource systems and the environment deteriorated in
   1960-79 compared to the performance prior to 1960. The condition reached
   a low point during 1980-1999 but improved slightly after 1999. The
   horizontal network structure of local governance was active until 1960.
   Due to the introduction of the `tidal river management' approach in the
   90 s, the performance of the resource system and the environment has
   slightly improved, as has the involvement of government and
   non-government organizations. Our results also show that overall SES
   performance is comparatively better <in the case of locally managed
   floodplains than it is for those managed by government agencies. Our new
   approaches, such as the recent development of the diagnostic framework,
   the guiding questions for defining focal SES, and application of the
   framework to local public goods can potentially be used in the fields of
   sustainability science and SES science. The qualitative performance of
   each of the selected indicators is useful for identifying intervention
   options to achieve a sustainable outcome for the coastal floodplain SES.},

Title = {Rural social-ecological systems vulnerability evolution and
   spatial-temporal heterogeneity in arid environmental change region: A
   case study of Minqin Oasis, northwestern China},
Journal = {APPLIED GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {145},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Theoretical and methodological approaches of social-ecological system's
   vulnerability provide a new perspective for the sustainable development
   of arid areas. However, the spatial distribution heterogeneity of
   internal ele-ments of vulnerability has always been ignored in current
   academic research and policy practice. Especially in low-exposure but
   high-vulnerability areas, it is more urgent to explore the
   vulnerability-causing factors and construct the response capacity.
   Therefore, according to the concept of vulnerability and its internal
   element relationship, this study proposes an analysis method for the
   spatial-temporal heterogeneity of exposure risk and vulnerability. With
   the aid of GIS, while assessing the spatial-temporal evolution of the
   overall vulnerability of the Minqin Oasis since the comprehensive
   management of Shiyang River Basin, we pay more attention to the
   spatial-temporal heterogeneity of the internal elements of
   vulnerability. Then applying the stepwise regression and geographically
   weighted regression, the article further analyzed the intrinsic reasons
   for spatial-temporal heterogeneity of SES's vulnerability and exposure
   risk. The results are as follows. 1) The vulnerability in Min-qin County
   from 2008 to 2016 was relatively low and showed an evolutionary trend of
   increased and then decreased. In addition, the vulnerability area was
   high in the Quanshan and Dam Districts and low in the Lake District; 2)
   the spatial-temporal heterogeneity of system exposure risk and
   vulnerability was significant and gradually reduced; and 3) the five
   main factors affecting spatial-temporal heterogeneity of the
   vulnerability of SES in Minqin Oasis include: per capita cultivated
   area, disaster-affected area, domestic water consumption, financial
   savings, and afforestation area. Finally, we proposed targeted
   recommendations for effective adaptive management and sustainable
   development for exposure-vulnerability heterogeneous regions.},

Title = {Can the Indonesian Collective Action Norm of Gotong-Royong Be
   Strengthened with Economic Incentives? Comparing the Implementation of
   an Aquaculture Irrigation Policy Program},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE COMMONS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {17},
Number = {1},
Pages = {462-480},
Abstract = {The Indonesian multi-level governmental program (PITAP) is a
   participatory pond irrigation management policy established by the
   Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries. It aims to catalyze the
   rehabilitation of irrigation canals to improve water access for
   small-scale aquaculture farmers. In PITAP, traditional aquaculture
   farmers are incentivized with government funding to create
   community-based co-management groups (POKLINA), to maintain the
   self-governance of their irrigation canals. The logic of PITAP is to
   encourage POKLINA farmers to rehabilitate their irrigation canals
   through subsidized labor payments that are coupled with strengthening
   the strong cultural norm of mutual assistance (i.e., collective action)
   within Indonesian society called Gotong-Royong. PITAP aims to revitalize
   Gotong-Royong through subsidized labor compensation with the hope that
   when the subsidy program is over, Gotong-Royong will be revitalized
   without external support. In this study, we compare and analyze four
   villages on Lombok, Indonesia, that participated in PITAP program in
   2020 and 2021. The study is supported with empirical data using various
   qualitative data collection methods, including interviews, participant
   observations, and the collection of policy documents. We further use the
   Social-Ecological System Framework (SESF) as a diagnostic tool to
   structure the data collection process and analysis. Findings indicate
   that different variables hinder and enable collective action in the four
   villages, leading to different PITAP program outcomes. The likely reason
   for this, suggested by our findings, is that each village has different
   social and ecological conditions that influence intrinsic motivation for
   collective action. PITAP program either crowds out intrinsic motivation
   under some conditions or crowds it in under others. This suggests the
   need to consider contextual adaptations in policy design and
   implementation to improve outcomes better.},

Title = {Impacts of climate change on tropical agroforestry systems: A systematic
   review for identifying future research priorities},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {5},
Month = {AUG 22},
Abstract = {Climate change is expected to adversely affect the crop yields and food
   security for many smallholder farmers in the tropics unless adaptive
   measures are implemented. Agroforestry ecosystem services, such as
   micro-climate buffering, have received growing attention from the
   academic and policy communities for alleviating the negative impacts of
   climate change on smallholders. These benefits imply that agroforestry
   could offer a suitable measure for adaptation to climate change.
   However, whether agroforestry systems themselves succumb to the adverse
   effects of climate change is often less studied in the agroforestry
   literature. Consequently, less is known about how climate change will
   impact agroforests. We conducted a systematic review, which included an
   evidence quality assessment, to examine the impacts of climate change on
   tropical agroforestry systems (TAFS). Based primarily on studies
   undertaking biophysical approaches, we found that climate change
   negatively impacts TAFS by reducing tree growth, intensifying tree-crop
   resource competition and reducing crop yields. However, the impacts on
   smallholder farmers are less clear due to limited evidence in the
   relevant literature. We found that the evidence supporting our findings
   is mostly ``robust ``, although ``least robust `` strength evidence was
   also commonly found. We conclude that to improve understanding of how
   climate change could affect the performance of TAFS as a social
   ecological system, more interdisciplinary studies are required.
   Furthermore, to improve the quality of evidence in the research field,
   studies should explore using mountain elevation gradients for climate
   analog analysis to perform the most robust study designs. We provide an
   interdisciplinary conceptual model, which considers the interactions and
   feedbacks between TAFS components noted from our review to predict the
   response of ecosystem services provisioning and farmers' wellbeing to
   climate change, to guide interdisciplinary studies using climate analog
   analysis.},

Title = {Analysing potato late blight control as a social-ecological system using
   fuzzy cognitive mapping},
Journal = {AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {36},
Number = {2},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Potato late blight, caused by Phytophthora infestans, is one of the main
   diseases in potato production, causing major losses in yield. Applying
   environmentally harmful fungicides is the prevailing and classical
   method for controlling late blight, thus contaminating food and water.
   There is therefore a need for innovative research approaches to produce
   food sustainably. Here, we used a systems approach to identify
   sustainable management strategies for disease control in potato
   production in the Netherlands. We focussed not only on ecological
   processes, the classical approach, but also on decision-making
   concerning disease management. For that, we performed a literature
   study, stakeholder interviews and modelling using fuzzy cognitive
   mapping. Interviews were carried out with farmers, representatives of
   breeding companies and experts. The fuzzy cognitive map allows to
   identify major concepts and their influence on late blight management.
   Three management scenarios were analysed using the fuzzy cognitive map.
   Results show that published research on the control of potato late
   blight focusses on agronomic practices, plant breeding for resistance to
   late blight and chemical-based disease suppression. Farmers are strongly
   influenced by corporate (such as traders, breeders and retail) and
   public institutes and policies, each pushing their own objectives and
   interests. The fuzzy cognitive map showed that social and ecological
   processes are tightly related. The scenario analysis showed that
   increasing stakeholder cooperation and a change in market demands
   towards resistant cultivars could improve sustainability of late blight
   management. In contrast, policies restricting the use of fungicides
   would result in increased disease severity if no alternative strategies
   were implemented. Adoption of such strategies would require
   social-institutional support and facilitation. We conclude that our
   systems approach improves the understanding of the system dynamics which
   is necessary for developing and deploying effective strategies for
   controlling P. infestans.},

Title = {Defining community revitalization in Great Lakes Areas of Concern and

Abstract = {An international effort to restore contaminated areas across the Great
   Lakes has been underway for over 50 years. Although experts have
   increasingly recognized the inherent connections between ecological
   conditions and community level benefits, Great Lakes community
   revitalization continues to be a broad and complex topic, lacking a
   comprehensive definition. The purpose of this study was to generate a
   tes -table ``AOC-Revitalization Framework{''} for linking remediation
   and restoration success, represented by Beneficial Use Impairment (BUI)
   removal in U.S. Great Lakes Areas of Concern (AOC), to community
   revi-talization. Using directed content analysis, we conducted a
   literature review and identified 433 potential revitalization metrics
   and indicators and grouped them into 15 broader community revitalization
   attri-butes to develop the following definition of Great Lakes community
   revitalization: ``locally driven commu-nity resurgence resulting in
   resilient and equitable enhancements to social, economic, and
   environmental community structures.{''} We surveyed experts within the
   Great Lakes AOC program on the likelihood reme-diation and restoration
   success, would positively impact revitalization attributes. Focus groups
   triangu-lated survey results. Results identified BUI removal was
   expected to positively affect revitalization, but the type of
   revitalization outcome was based on the BUI being removed. The
   AOC-Revitalization Framework is the first to empirically outline these
   possible linkages, providing a clear testable structure for future
   research; it can be used to better understand how environmental
   improvements are or are not leading to community revitalization and more
   accurately identify components of revitalization impacted, thus
   supporting more equitable representation, communication, and measurement
   of the relationship. (c) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {Our research addresses the gap in scientific research on the fine-grain
   spatial patterns and social-ecological interactions of land use and
   agrobiodiversity. The spatial dimension of agrobiodiversity dynamics
   potentially strengthens the social-ecological resilience and food
   security of smallholders by buffering risk and vulnerability. Our
   research integrates the scientific theories, concepts, and methods of
   spatial externalities, social-ecological interactions, geospatial land
   and global change sciences, and political ecology. We designed a case
   study of the Arbieto-Tarata landscape in the Bolivian Andes that
   comprises a globally significant agrobiodiversity hot spot of Andean
   maize. The Arbieto-Tarata landscape, which contains nearly 8000 fields
   at 2500-2800 masl, is representative of mixed-use smallholder agri-food
   systems amid global changes. Our research predicts spatial spillover and
   edge effects of combined social and environmental factors leading to the
   clustering of same-crop fields. Findings reveal significant levels of
   the predicted clustering between 2006 and 2012. The degree of this
   clustering is found to differ among geographic and environmental
   sub-areas reflecting fine-grain variation of local causal linkages.
   Extra-local causal linkages include high levels of migration, water
   resource shortages, and urbanization. Results show the influences of
   informal and formal coordination in the spatial clustering of same-crop
   fields. This field-level coordination improves the efficiency of
   resource allocations and lowers costs of production. It enables the
   viability of high-agrobiodiversity Andean maize in smallholder land use
   and agri-food systems amid global changes. The article discusses the
   broader policy and scientific implications of these findings including
   scaling up and support of the social-ecological resilience of
   agrobiodiversity globally.},

Title = {Modeling Soft Institutional Change and the Improvement of Freshwater
   Governance in the Coastal Zone},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {16},
Number = {4},
Abstract = {The contribution of soft institutional change to improve freshwater
   governance in the coastal zone will be examined. Freshwater management
   seeks to reduce losses due to overexploitation of the common-pool
   resources provided by river catchments and their associated ecosystems.
   Due to the complexity of the governance system, improving the
   performance of one coastal social-ecological system means searching for
   the appropriate ``soft{''} institutional change. In the Pertuis
   Charentais region, increasing scarcity of freshwater in summer threatens
   the health of the coastal ecosystem and the sustainability of human
   activities, which depend on the use of natural resources. The allocation
   of freshwater among competing uses or concerns is a core issue for
   integrated coastal zone management. To address this issue, we have
   constructed an analytical framework that combines the ecosystem services
   approach with the institutional analysis of common-pool resources, and
   have developed an integrated simulation tool based on the system dynamic
   modeling approach. Freshwater scarcity generates three kinds of user
   conflict: (1) conflict between two extractive uses of freshwater
   (irrigation and drinking water), (2) conflicts between extractive uses
   (provisioning services) and other services (support, regulatory, and
   cultural) provided by freshwater, and (3) competition within a given
   activity sector (agriculture or shellfish farming). Participation by
   local managers led to the identification of realistic soft institutional
   changes that might mitigate conflicts and improve the governance system.
   These possible institutional changes were then integrated as fixed
   exogenous parameters in the simulation model. The simulated scenarios
   suggest that innovative collective arrangements involving farmers could
   be an alternative to other more restrictive top-down measures. This
   participatory experiment also illustrates the potential of
   social-ecological modeling for exploring acceptable new institutional
   arrangements.},

Title = {Combining ecohydrologic and transition probability-based modeling to
   simulate vegetation dynamics in a semi-arid rangeland},

Abstract = {Drylands support pastoralist social-ecological systems around the world.
   Ecological function in these water-limited environments frequently
   depends on tightly coupled, nonlinear interactions between water, soil,
   vegetation, and herbivores. Numerous complexity-based approaches have
   modeled localized ecohydrological feedbacks to yield insights into
   dryland landscape organization and emergent dynamics. The relevance of
   these models to management and sustainability continues to increase as
   researchers incorporate ecological processes at multiple scales and
   social-ecological variables like herding practices. However, many
   processes vary in their importance depending on ecological context, so
   there is a continuing need to construct models tailored to different
   contexts. We developed a model for semiarid rangelands that experience
   highly variable rainfall, substantial Hortonian runoff during rain
   events, patchy vegetation structure, and grazing-influenced patch
   transitions. The model couples an existing, mechanistic cellular
   automata model of hillslope water balance with a dynamic vegetation
   model in which probabilistic transitions between bare, annual grass,
   perennial grass patches depend on soil moisture and grazing intensity.
   The model was parameterized based on a field site in Kenya, from which
   we had empirical hydrological measurements and several years of
   patch-to-hillslope scale measurements of vegetation structure. The model
   domain is a 100 x 100 grid of 2 x 2 m cells, it simulates seasonal
   cycles of growing seasons followed by dry seasons, and it computes daily
   soil moisture based on stochastic rainfall forcings. Patch type
   transitions can occur twice during each seasonal cycle: at the end of
   the growing season, with probabilities based on average growing-season
   soil moisture availability; and at the end of the dry season, with
   probabilities based on grazing intensity and antecedent growing-season
   soil moisture. By parameterizing grazing intensity as a per-patch
   impact, it can be interpreted as the degree of forage depletion at which
   a herder decides to leave the area. We conducted a series of simulation
   experiments, principally altering runoff channelization and grazing
   intensity. The model generated plausible vegetation dynamics across the
   range of grazing intensities simulated. Vegetation cover fluctuated
   seasonally,. but never collapsed completely, even at the highest grazing
   intensity. At low to intermediate grazing, we observed multi-decadal
   switches in fractional perennial cover, triggered by periods of below-
   or above-average rainfall. At low to intermediate grazing intensities,
   we noted emergent spatial patterning in the form of a step-like increase
   in vegetation density in the lower half of the domain. With a vegetation
   patch transitions governed by mechanistic water balance dynamics as well
   as grazing intensities that represent herder decision-making, the model
   holds great potential for further explorations of how land use, climate,
   and spatial heterogeneity affect the functioning of a dryland
   pastoralist social-ecological system. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {Scenarios for an agroecological transition of smallholder family
   farmers: a case study in Guadeloupe},

Abstract = {In Guadeloupe, a French overseas region, civil society is calling for an
   agroecological transition (AET) to obtain access to healthy agricultural
   products following a major ecological scandal caused by a persistent
   pesticide that contaminated water and agricultural soils. To support
   such a transition, we tested a five-step methodological framework
   designed to enable farmers to describe and explore scenarios in farming
   systems, socio-technical systems, and social-ecological systems. This is
   one of the first operational methodological tools to build scenarios and
   action plans for an AET taking into account simultaneous changes in
   these three systems. We first surveyed 63 farmers and positioned their
   farming systems along an AET gradient using the
   Efficiency-Substitution-Redesign framework. In the second step, a
   sub-sample of 18 farmers, who represented diverse farming system types,
   individually defined AET scenarios at the level of their own farms. We
   then applied a farm simulation model to evaluate the technical and
   economic performance of each scenario. The third step involved analyzing
   the types of social networks used by 45 farmers to share information and
   promote technical, commercial, and social exchanges to implement
   agroecological practices in their territory. In the fourth step, we
   worked with a group of 15 farmers and 10 researchers in a participatory
   workshop to characterize the natural resources, their associated
   services and disservices, and the actors involved. In the last step, the
   farmers and researchers defined an action plan for the AET in their
   territory. Our results suggest that AET is understood by farmers to be a
   gradual and multiscale process involving the co-creation of knowledge,
   technical solutions, and organizational changes. An initial outcome of
   the process tested was a shift in the stance of researchers. Their focus
   shifted from experiments conducted on-station toward experiments managed
   by farmers to co-produce knowledge on the viability of agroecological
   practices under their own specific conditions, triggering discussions
   between stakeholders (such as advisers, policy makers, smallholders, and
   larger farmers) in the territory.},

Title = {Operationalizing resilience for adaptive coral reef management under

Pages = {48-61},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Cumulative pressures from global climate and ocean change combined with
   multiple regional and local-scale stressors pose fundamental challenges
   to coral reef managers worldwide. Understanding how cumulative stressors
   affect coral reef vulnerability is critical for successful reef
   conservation now and in the future. In this review, we present the case
   that strategically managing for increased ecological resilience
   (capacity for stress resistance and recovery) can reduce coral reef
   vulnerability (risk of net decline) up to a point. Specifically, we
   propose an operational framework for identifying effective management
   levers to enhance resilience and support management decisions that
   reduce reef vulnerability. Building on a system understanding of
   biological and ecological processes that drive resilience of coral reefs
   in different environmental and socio-economic settings, we present an
   Adaptive Resilience-Based management (ARBM) framework and suggest a set
   of guidelines for how and where resilience can be enhanced via
   management interventions. We argue that press-type stressors (pollution,
   sedimentation, overfishing, ocean warming and acidification) are key
   threats to coral reef resilience by affecting processes underpinning
   resistance and recovery, while pulse-type (acute) stressors (e.g.
   storms, bleaching events, crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks) increase
   the demand for resilience. We apply the framework to a set of example
   problems for Caribbean and Indo-Pacific reefs. A combined strategy of
   active risk reduction and resilience support is needed, informed by key
   management objectives, knowledge of reef ecosystem processes and
   consideration of environmental and social drivers. As climate change and
   ocean acidification erode the resilience and increase the vulnerability
   of coral reefs globally, successful adaptive management of coral reefs
   will become increasingly difficult. Given limited resources,
   on-the-ground solutions are likely to focus increasingly on actions that
   support resilience at finer spatial scales, and that are tightly linked
   to ecosystem goods and services.},

Title = {Transition from subsistence grazing to nature-based recreation: A
   nuanced view of land abandonment in a mountain social-ecological system,
   southwestern Cape, South Africa},
Journal = {LAND USE POLICY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {105},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Over the last 50 years, studies have shown a decline in the use of
   mountain lands, a phenomenon termed land abandonment. We investigate the
   causal mechanisms of land use change in a mountain catchment important
   for regional water supplies in the southwestern Cape of South Africa.
   Uniquely, we include nature-based recreational land use types typically
   excluded from land abandonment studies. We repeated a structured
   questionnaire originally conducted with landowners 38 years previously
   and analysed orthoimages from 1948, 1972 and 2014. To identify and
   contextualise causal mechanisms of change we used thematic analysis and
   generated narratives from in-depth interviews with landowners. The land
   use system in 1948 and 1972 was dominated by livestock based,
   subsistence agriculture and small-scale farming. This transitioned to
   agricultural intensification on the lowlands and small portions of the
   mountains and the utilisation of mountains for non-economic nature-based
   recreation and ecotourism. The use of frequent small, low
   intensity-controlled fires was prevalent in the past. More recently,
   fires have been actively suppressed resulting in the build-up of biomass
   and the development of infrequent, extensive, high-intensity wildfires.
   Land use change in the mountains was driven primarily by socioeconomic
   drivers, including socio-economic benefits related to globalisation and
   economic growth, and not by concerns over land degradation or resource
   depletion. Our findings support evidence that shows that people?s
   responses to economic opportunities drive local determinants of land use
   change and highlights the importance of perceptions in driving land use
   transitions. We show that existing models of land abandonment are likely
   overly deterministic in that they do not consider social and cultural
   factors that may cause a landowner to continue using their land for
   semi-economic or non-economic reasons. While there is merit in
   large-scale remote sensing studies, we emphasise the importance of using
   mixed remote sensing and social science methods for informing models of
   land use change.},

Title = {Integrating societal perspectives and values for improved stewardship of
   a coastal ecosystem engineer},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {19},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {Oyster reefs provide coastal societies with a vast array of ecosystem
   services, but are also destructively harvested as an economically and
   culturally important fishery resource, exemplifying a complex
   social-ecological system (SES). Historically, societal demand for
   oysters has led to destructive and unsustainable levels of harvest,
   which coupled with multiple other stressors has placed oyster reefs
   among the most globally imperiled coastal habitats. However, more recent
   studies have demonstrated that large-scale restoration is possible and
   that healthy oyster populations can be sustained with effective
   governance and stewardship. However, both of these require significant
   societal support or financial investment. In our study, we explored
   relationships among how coastal societies (1) perceive and value oyster
   ecosystem services, (2) recognize and define problems associated with
   oyster decline, and (3) perceive or support stewardship initiatives. We
   specifically focused on the SES of eastern oysters (Crassostrea
   virginica) and coastal societies in the northern Gulf of Mexico, a
   region identified as offering among the last and best opportunities to
   sustainably balance conservation objectives with a wild fishery. We
   found that, in addition to harvest-related benefits, oysters were highly
   valued for providing habitat, mitigating shoreline erosion, and
   improving water quality or clarity. Our results also showed that
   although most respondents recognized that oyster populations have
   declined, many respondents characterized the problem differently than
   most scientific literature does. Among a variety of initiatives for
   enhancing sustainability, spawning sanctuaries and reef restoration were
   well supported in all states, but support for harvest reductions was
   less consistent. Our study suggests that public support for maintaining
   both harvest and ecosystem services exists at societal levels and that
   enhancing public awareness regarding the extent and causes of oyster
   decline could garner additional support for stewardship initiatives.
   Collectively, the societal, economic, and biophysical complexities of
   the northern Gulf of Mexico oyster SES illustrate the need and public
   support for developing more comprehensive management schemes for
   exploited ecosystem engineers.},

Title = {Comparison of social-ecological resilience between two grassland

Abstract = {Embraced for decision-making, resilience has evolved as a meaningful
   term in areas such as ecology, the economy and society. After a policy
   of grassland contracts was implemented on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau,
   two grassland management patterns evolved: the multi-household
   management pattern (MMP) and the single-household management pattern
   (SMP). Within a resilience-driven perspective, this study compared the
   outcomes of these grassland management patterns by measuring their
   effects on the resilience of grazing, ecological, economic and social
   systems. Resilience indicators for each of the four systems were:
   grazing system (grazing space, transhumance, water source and
   reproduction); ecological system (vegetation including cover, biomass,
   species richness and soil properties including pH, organic carbon, total
   nitrogen and total phosphorus); economic system (income, expenditure and
   infrastructure) and the social system (health, assistance, social
   relations, cultural inheritance and institutional arrangements). In
   order to provide a social-ecological resilience framework for the two
   grassland management patterns, a decision support tool was applied to
   approximately gauge the resilience of each indicator. The results showed
   that each of the four systems under the MMP had a greater degree of
   resilience than the SMP, and that the overall resilience of the MMP was
   estimated at 5.8 units compared to about - 5.8 units for the SMP. The
   relative success of the MMP was seen to rest largely on the maintenance
   of traditional management practices, social networks, trust and the low
   cost and high efficiency of informal institutions, which acted to reduce
   the risk of unsustainable development of ecological and social systems.
   The important take-home lesson from this study is that contracting of
   grasslands to private entities on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, and in
   the rest of the world where similar land management practices exist,
   must be undertaken with caution.},

Title = {Coupled biophysical and decision-making processes in grassland systems
   in East African savannahs-A modelling framework},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MODELLING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {474},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Increasing livestock densities on limited grazing areas in African
   savannahs lead to resource degradation through overgrazing, aggravated
   by drought. Assessing herd management strategies over longer periods at
   landscape scale is important to propose options for sustainable land
   use. This requires an understanding of processes related to hydrology,
   nutrient cycling, herd movement, pasture degradation, and animal
   resilience that involve dynamic soil-plant-animal interactions and human
   decisions about stocking rates, livestock purchases and sales.We present
   the coupled model system MPMAS-LUCIA-LIVSIM (MLL), the combination of a
   spatially explicit agent-based model for human decision-making (MPMAS),
   a spatially distributed landscape model for water flows, nutrient cycles
   and plant growth (LUCIA), and a herd model (LIVSIM) representing
   grazing, body weight, nutrition and excreta of individual animals. MLL
   represents daily vegetation growth in response to grazing and organic
   inputs, monthly animal performance influenced by forage availability and
   quality, and herders' man-agement in response to resource status. New
   modules for selective grazing, resprouting of pasture, herd move-ment
   and model coupling were developed for MLL.The test case of a pastoral
   system in the Ethiopian Borana region demonstrates the capabilities of
   MLL to simulate key soil-plant-animal-human interactions under
   climate-related management scenarios with varying access to grazing
   land, changing cattle prices and different spending / saving behaviour
   of herders. 20-year simulations showed the negative impact of
   consecutive drought years on vegetation biomass, on herd devel-opment
   and movement and how reserving grazing areas for dry seasons could
   mitigate overgrazing and improve income. Seasonality and drought
   response of vegetation growth, selective grazing of different plant
   parts, resprouting after grazing, calving intervals, milk yields and
   lactation in response to forage supply and quality as well as herder
   reactions to shocks were plausibly represented.Building upon this
   successful proof-of-concept, MLL can be used to identify robust
   management options for improved grazing systems in savannahs in
   follow-up research.},

Journal = {GLOBAL SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {6},
Month = {APR 24},
Abstract = {Non-technical summaryThe United Nations' sustainable development goals
   (SDGs) articulate societal aspirations for people and our planet. Many
   scientists have criticised the SDGs and some have suggested that a
   better understanding of the complex interactions between society and the
   environment should underpin the next global development agenda. We
   further this discussion through the theory of social-ecological
   resilience, which emphasises the ability of systems to absorb, adapt,
   and transform in the face of change. We determine the strengths of the
   current SDGs, which should form a basis for the next agenda, and
   identify key gaps that should be filled. Technical summaryThe United
   Nations' sustainable development goals (SDGs) are past their halfway
   point and the next global development agenda will soon need to be
   developed. While laudable, the SDGs have received strong criticism from
   many, and scholars have proposed that adopting complex adaptive or
   social-ecological system approaches would increase the effectiveness of
   the agenda. Here we dive deeper into these discussions to explore how
   the theory of social-ecological resilience could serve as a strong
   foundation for the next global sustainable development agenda. We
   identify the strengths and weaknesses of the current SDGs by determining
   which of the 169 targets address each of 43 factors affecting
   social-ecological resilience that we have compiled from the literature.
   The SDGs with the strongest connections to social-ecological resilience
   are the environment-focus goals (SDGs 2, 6, 13, 14, 15), which are also
   the goals consistently under-prioritised in the implementation of the
   current agenda. In terms of the 43 factors affecting social-ecological
   resilience, the SDG strengths lie in their communication, inclusive
   decision making, financial support, regulatory incentives, economic
   diversity, and transparency in governance and law. On the contrary,
   ecological factors of resilience are seriously lacking in the SDGs,
   particularly with regards to scale, cross-scale interactions, and
   non-stationarity. Social media summaryThe post-2030 agenda should build
   on strengths of SDGs 2, 6, 13, 14, 15, and fill gaps in scale,
   variability, and feedbacks.},

Title = {Can Payments for Ecosystem Services Contribute to Adaptation to Climate
   Change? Insights from a Watershed in Kenya},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {19},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Climate change presents new challenges for the management of
   social-ecological systems and the ecosystem services they provide.
   Although the instrument of payments for ecosystem services (PES) has
   emerged as a promising tool to safeguard or enhance the provision of
   ecosystem services (ES), little attention has been paid to the potential
   role of PES in climate change adaptation. As an external stressor
   climate change has an impact on the social-ecological system in which
   PES takes place, including the various actors taking part in the PES
   scheme. Following a short description of the conceptual link between PES
   and adaptation to climate change, we provide practical insights into the
   relationship between PES and adaptation to climate change by presenting
   results from a case study of a rural watershed in Kenya. Drawing upon
   the results of a participatory vulnerability assessment among potential
   ecosystem service providers in Sasumua watershed north of Nairobi, we
   show that PES can play a role in enhancing adaptation to climate change
   by influencing certain elements of adaptive capacity and incentivizing
   adaptation measures. In addition, trade-offs and synergies between
   proposed measures under PES and adaptation to climate change are
   identified. Results show that although it may not be possible to
   establish PES schemes based on water utilities as the sole source of
   financing, embedding PES in a wider adaptation framework creates an
   opportunity for the development of watershed PES schemes in Africa and
   ensures their sustainability. We conclude that there is a need to embed
   PES in a wider institutional framework and that extra financial
   resources are needed to foster greater integration between PES and
   adaptation to climate change. This can be achieved through scaling up
   PES by bringing in other buyers and additional ecosystem services. PES
   can achieve important coadaptation benefits, but for more effective
   adaptation outcomes it needs to be combined with vulnerability
   assessments and climate scenarios to ensure that these are realized and
   potential trade-offs between PES measures and adaptation measures
   minimized.},

   we explored how the multidimensional assessment approach may inform
   ecologically coherent and socially equitable coastal governance and
   development. We conducted three cycles of participatory planning
   workshops (n = 39) with all groups: to map uses and activities across 7
   contextually different planning units; to identify conflicts; and to
   assess the spatial distribution of risks to the ecosystem. We mapped the
   spatial distribution of 28 activities that directly generate
   provisioning and cultural ecosystem services (ES), and their associated
   indirect impact-chains on all ESs types and affected users. A total of
   44 conflicts (32 inter- and 12 intra-sectoral) were discussed, and were
   higher in more intensely used areas. A habitat risk assessment scaled-up
   an ecosystem-level understanding of areas in need of urgent management.
   Important habitats (mangroves, submerged rocky outcrops, soft bottoms,
   water column) are facing high levels of risk; and a significant
   heterogeneity in spatial distribution of risk justifies radically
   alternative, contextually-based management and development measures to
   challenge the status quo. We conclude that the ecosystem services will
   likely continue to benefit present and future generations if an
   ecosystem-based management approach is consistently adopted with five
   sets of priorities: 1) advance plural valuation mechanisms with
   awareness of pressure-levels on the ecosystem; 2) manage conflicts while
   creating synergies amongst existing activities across space; 3) avoid
   expansion of pressure on ecologically sensitive areas; 4) consolidate
   the emerging novel democratic governance mechanism; and 5) explore the
   transferability approach's potential to scale-up coastal governance
   transformation in Brazil.},

Title = {Drivers of change and adaptation pathways of agricultural systems facing
   increased salinity intrusion in coastal areas of the Mekong and Red
   River deltas in Vietnam},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {92},

Abstract = {Agricultural systems are increasingly considered complex adaptive
   systems. They are dependent on the integrated nature of biophysical and
   social sub-systems, continuously adapt to changing conditions and often
   display non-linear responses to various drivers of change at multiple
   scales. This research applied the lens of complex adaptive systems
   theory to analyze current and historical drivers of change and
   adaptation pathways of agricultural systems to increased salinity
   intrusion in coastal areas of the Red River and Mekong deltas in Vietnam
   since 1975, The analysis is based on 27 in-depth interviews with
   officials of local and national authorities as well as 198
   semi-structured interviews and 11 focus group discussions conducted with
   farmers along three salinity transects in both deltas in 2015-2016. The
   results show that a dynamic interplay and feedback of various drivers of
   change such as policy intervention, farmers' desire for profit
   maximization, changing salinity conditions, and technological
   development at different levels of the deltaic social-ecological system
   have shaped the changes and adaptations in agricultural systems over the
   last decades. In response to increased salinity intrusion, as
   exemplified by the historic salinity levels recorded in the Mekong Delta
   in 2015-2016, various adaptation options have been considered. These
   include adaptations that would lock-in agricultural production in
   particular systems or constrain changes in others, which is potentially
   problematic in light of the high uncertainty related to future changes.
   The study recognizes the need to apply both incremental and
   transformative changes and select adaptation pathways which allow for
   continuous change or that are reversible in order to avoid lock-ins and
   address future challenges. Additionally, attention should be drawn to
   interactions and feedbacks in future changes within and across
   adaptation pathways in order to prevent further increases in salinity
   intrusion and lock-in effects in agricultural systems within the deltas.},

Title = {Drivers of Productivity Trends in Cork Oak Woodlands over the Last 15
   Years},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {8},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Higher biodiversity leads to more productive ecosystems which, in turn,
   supports more biodiversity. Ongoing global changes affect ecosystem
   productivity and, therefore, are expected to affect
   productivity-biodiversity relationships. However, the magnitude of these
   relationships may be affected by baseline biodiversity and its
   lifeforms. Cork oak (Quercus suber) woodlands are a highly biodiverse
   Mediterranean ecosystem managed for cork extraction; as a result of this
   management cork oak woodlands may have both tree and shrub canopies,
   just tree and just shrub canopies, and just grasslands. Trees, shrubs,
   and grasses may respond differently to climatic variables and their
   combination may, therefore, affect measurements of productivity and the
   resulting productivity-biodiversity relationships. Here, we asked
   whether the relationship between productivity and climate is affected by
   the responses of trees, shrubs, and grasses in cork oak woodlands in
   Southern Portugal. To answer this question, we linked a 15-year time
   series of Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) derived from Landsat
   satellites to micrometeorological data to assess the relationship
   between trends in EVI and climate. Between 2000 and 2013 we observed an
   overall decrease in EVI. However, EVI increased over cork oaks and
   decreased over shrublands. EVI trends were strongly positively related
   to changes in relative humidity and negatively related to temperature.
   The intra-annual EVI cycle of grasslands and sparse cork oak woodland
   without understorey (savannah-like ecosystem) had higher variation than
   the other land-cover types. These results suggest that oaks and shrubs
   have different responses to changes in water availability, which can be
   either related to oak physiology, to oaks being either more resilient or
   having lagged responses to changes in climate, or to the fact that
   shrublands start senesce earlier than oaks. Our results also suggest
   that in the future EVI could improve because the rate of increase in
   minimum EVI is greater than the rate of decrease in maximum EVI, and
   that this is contingent on management of the shrub understorey as it
   affects the rate of decrease in maximum EVI. This will be the challenge
   for the persistence of cork oak woodlands, their associated biodiversity
   and social-ecological system.},

Title = {Integrating social and ecological data to model metapopulation dynamics
   in coupled human and natural systems},
Journal = {ECOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {100},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Understanding how metapopulations persist in dynamic working landscapes
   requires assessing the behaviors of key actors that change patches as
   well as intrinsic factors driving turnover. Coupled human and natural
   systems (CHANS) research uses a multidisciplinary approach to identify
   the key actors, processes, and feedbacks that drive metapopulation and
   landscape dynamics. We describe a framework for modeling metapopulations
   in CHANS that integrates ecological and social data by coupling
   stochastic patch occupancy models of metapopulation dynamics with
   agent-based models of land-use change. We then apply this framework to
   metapopulations of the threatened black rail (Laterallus jamaicensis)
   and widespread Virginia rail (Rallus limicola) that inhabit patchy,
   irrigation-fed wetlands in the rangelands of the California Sierra
   Nevada foothills. We collected data from five diverse sources (rail
   occupancy surveys, land-use change mapping, a survey of landowner
   decision making, climate and reservoir databases, and mosquito trapping
   and West Nile virus testing) and integrated them into an agent-based
   stochastic patch occupancy model. We used the model to (1) quantify the
   drivers of metapopulation dynamics, and the potential interactions and
   feedbacks among them; (2) test predictions of the behavior of
   metapopulations in dynamic working landscapes; and (3) evaluate the
   impact of three policy options on metapopulation persistence (irrigation
   district water cutbacks during drought, incentives for landowners to
   create wetlands, and incentives for landowners to protect wetlands).
   Complex metapopulation dynamics emerged when landscapes functioned as
   CHANS, highlighting the importance of integrating human activities and
   other ecological processes into metapopulation models. Rail
   metapopulations were strongly top-down regulated by precipitation, and
   the black rail's decade-long decline was caused by the combination of
   West Nile virus and drought. Theoretical predictions of the two
   metapopulations' responses to dynamic landscapes and incentive programs
   were complicated by heterogeneity in patch quality and CHANS couplings,
   respectively. Irrigation cutbacks during drought posed a serious
   extinction risk that neither incentive policy effectively ameliorated.},

Abstract = {A prototype Bayesian belief network (BBN) is described that provides
   catchment-to-reef integration of previously unlinked components of the
   Great Barrier Reef (GBR) social-ecological system.
   The BBN is developed to help decision-makers understand the
   socio-economic trade-offs associated with managing for resilient reef
   communities given the threat posed by climate change. The probability of
   severe coral bleaching events increases with climate-driven increases in
   surface ocean temperatures, but this threat is synergistically linked to
   the water quality within the GBR lagoon. Improved inshore water quality
   requires the adoption of `best practice' catchment management, which may
   incur considerable cost to the agricultural industry. However, this cost
   is countered by the associated benefit of safeguarding future reef
   tourism. The aim of this work is to develop a prototype model capable of
   investigating these key system linkages only. The BBN formalises this
   socio-ecological cost-benefit analysis within a risk assessment
   framework. This aids the difficult task of prioritising alternative
   management actions. The complexity of the problem represents a
   challenging modelling task with a large envelope of solutions needing to
   be represented, each with its own scale and configuration of `wins' and
   `losses' across diverse system sectors. To simplify the modelling task,
   we specifically targeted key elements of the reef, agriculture, and
   tourism sectors and then focused on developing the most parsimonious set
   of cross-sector linkages to generate an integrated systems model. We
   focus here on the approach used, as results are not yet available. The
   diverse nature of the individual sectors presented a major challenge for
   model construction, not least because the causal (i.e. dependence)
   relationships within individual sectors exist at different levels of
   understanding and scientific development, as do the relationships
   between the separate sectors. Furthermore, the data that captures the
   functional behaviour of each sector (as well as cross-sector
   interactions) exists as an eclectic mix of simulated, empirical and
   subjectively-derived information. Fortunately, the adopted BBN approach
   is capable of resolving these system domain and data uncertainties in a
   transparent fashion, which includes the assigning of error estimates for
   the alternate system trade-off scenarios. By making these trade-off
   uncertainties explicit, the resultant framework provides decision-makers
   with a rational (i.e. quantitative) method to resolve catchment level
   questions such as;
   Which reef protection target provides the lowest risk and maximum
   benefit for the local community?
   How soon must reef protection targets be realised in order to maximise
   cross-sector benefits?
   Can win/win strategies be pursued with acceptable levels of certainty?
   For a given reef protection target, what are the costs to industry and
   how are they distributed across sectors?
   What are the risks and benefits of maximum and `do nothing' reef
   protection targets, and how are these risks and benefits distributed?
   Are the economic benefits to tourism likely to be large enough to
   balance economic losses to agriculture?
   Are economic losses in any sector likely to exist at levels that
   substantially reduce community wellbeing?
   What are the most influential system components, and are they amenable
   to policy development?
   The framework is currently under review by participants. Once the
   structure is verified, the prototype will be parameterised and
   evaluated.},

Abstract = {Many coastal communities depend on ecosystems for goods and services
   that contribute to human well-being. As long-standing interactions
   between people and nature are modified by global environmental change,
   dynamic and diversified livelihood strategies that enable seasonal
   adaptation will be critical for vulnerable coastal communities. However,
   the success of such strategies depends on a range of poorly understood
   influences. Gleaning, the hand-based collection of marine organisms from
   littoral habitats, provides an interesting case study of dynamic change
   in social-ecological interactions. It is an important coastal livelihood
   strategy, yet seasonal gleaning dynamics have not been empirically
   explored in contemporary communities. We examined seasonal gleaning in
   eight coastal communities on Atauro Island, Timor-Leste, using household
   surveys and satellite-derived maps of shallow-water benthic habitats.
   Our analysis explored the factors affecting household decisions to glean
   in each season, the relationship between gleaning and seafood
   consumption, and seasonal gleaning pressure on near-shore coastal
   resources. Dynamic marine harvesting strategies differed among
   households and gleaning activity was seasonally heterogeneous. Not all
   gleaning households gleaned during the season characterised by rough sea
   conditions despite rough season gleaning being associated with greater
   seafood consumption stability among seasons. Households also gleaned
   less regularly, and catches were smaller, in the rough season.
   Differences in seasonal participation in gleaning were explained mostly
   by type and extent of shallow habitat proximate to a community. In the
   calm season, household gleaning was positively related to the total area
   of shallow habitat, and in the rough season the percentage of
   hard-bottom shallow habitat was also an important predictor of gleaning
   activity. Our findings illustrate how changes in the biophysical
   environment mediate human-nature interactions at fine scales through
   time and space. Consequently, this research highlights the importance of
   context-specific perspectives for understanding drivers and dynamics in
   fishing pressure on littoral ecosystems, access to ecosystem benefits
   and limits to adaptation. Factors influencing when livelihood activities
   are feasible and desirable are important for evaluating the social
   impacts of climate change, particularly in the context of rural
   communities in the Global South.

Title = {Traditional Ecological Knowledge and Contemporary Changes in the
   Agro-pastoral System of Upper Spiti Landscape, Indian Trans-Himalayas},
Journal = {PASTORALISM-RESEARCH POLICY AND PRACTICE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {10},

Abstract = {Pastoral systems are known to be prone to social, political and
   ecological uncertainties. Traditional ecological knowledge that the
   pastoral communities hold around their bio-physical environment has been
   a key to cope with stressors and adapt to the rapid socio-economic
   changes. We examined traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) on livestock
   and resource management, factors influencing livestock production and
   concurrent changes in an agro-pastoral system. We used mixed methods by
   conducting 44 semi-structured interviews, 10 key informants' interviews
   and resource mapping in five villages of Upper Spiti Landscape, western
   Himalaya. Our specific objectives were to (i) document TEK on livestock
   diet and management and (ii) understand the drivers and consequences of
   the change in the agro-pastoral society and associated traditional
   knowledge system. The herders of the study area possessed extensive
   knowledge of livestock diet and fodder species preference. They used
   this knowledge to optimize livestock grazing in pastures during summers
   and to fulfil the nutrient requirements of livestock species during
   stall feeding in winters. Seasonally, the aspect, altitude and
   accessibility of the pasture influenced the rotational use of pastures.
   In contrast, the quality of forage and water availability, distance of
   the pasture from village and threats from predators influenced the
   selection of grazing areas daily. There are evident changes in the
   livestock production system and signs that TEK is eroding in the region.
   Primary contributing factors to loss of TEK include changing aspirations
   of local people. These aspirations were related to employment in
   lucrative alternative options like cash crops and tourism, out-migration
   of the young generation for higher education and the arrival of
   immigrant labourers as new actors in livestock management. Livestock
   numbers in the study site remained dynamic between the year 2003-2016
   owing to the substantive social and ecological changes. Our results
   suggest that while the traditional knowledge persists, the signs of
   erosion in traditional knowledge and associated changes in current
   herding practices are evident. We argue that recent changes in the
   pastoral social-ecological system, especially loss of TEK and
   non-traditional rearing practices, due to increasing dependence on
   immigrant labourers, may have negative implications for livestock
   production, rangeland health and wildlife conservation goals in the long
   run. Long term site-specific studies on livestock production and
   associated knowledge would be critical for adaptive rangeland management
   and policies.},

Title = {Reimagining large river management using the Resist-Accept-Direct (RAD)
   framework in the Upper Mississippi River},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Month = {OCT 4},
Abstract = {Background Large-river decision-makers are charged with maintaining
   diverse ecosystem services through unprecedented social-ecological
   transformations as climate change and other global stressors intensify.
   The interconnected, dendritic habitats of rivers, which often demarcate
   jurisdictional boundaries, generate complex management challenges. Here,
   we explore how the Resist-Accept-Direct (RAD) framework may enhance
   large-river management by promoting coordinated and deliberate responses
   to social-ecological trajectories of change. The RAD framework
   identifies the full decision space of potential management approaches,
   wherein managers may resist change to maintain historical conditions,
   accept change toward different conditions, or direct change to a
   specified future with novel conditions. In the Upper Mississippi River
   System, managers are facing social-ecological transformations from more
   frequent and extreme high-water events. We illustrate how RAD-informed
   basin-, reach-, and site-scale decisions could: (1) provide
   cross-spatial scale framing; (2) open the entire decision space of
   potential management approaches; and (3) enhance coordinated
   inter-jurisdictional management in response to the trajectory of the
   Upper Mississippi River hydrograph.Results The RAD framework helps
   identify plausible long-term trajectories in different reaches (or
   subbasins) of the river and how the associated social-ecological
   transformations could be managed by altering site-scale conditions.
   Strategic reach-scale objectives may reprioritize how, where, and when
   site conditions could be altered to contribute to the basin goal, given
   the basin's plausible trajectories of change (e.g., by coordinating
   action across sites to alter habitat connectivity, diversity, and
   redundancy in the river mosaic).Conclusions When faced with long-term
   systemic transformations (e.g., > 50 years), the RAD framework helps
   explicitly consider whether or when the basin vision or goals may no
   longer be achievable, and direct options may open yet unconsidered
   potential for the basin. Embedding the RAD framework in hierarchical
   decision-making clarifies that the selection of actions in space and
   time should be derived from basin-wide goals and reach-scale objectives
   to ensure that site-scale actions contribute effectively to the larger
   river habitat mosaic. Embedding the RAD framework in large-river
   decisions can provide the necessary conduit to link flexibility and
   innovation at the site scale with stability at larger scales for
   adaptive governance of changing social-ecological systems.},

Title = {Fostering local crop-livestock integration via legume exchanges using an
   innovative integrated assessment and modelling approach based on the
   MAELIA platform},
Journal = {AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {189},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {CONTEXT: Crop diversification is now well-recognised as a strong lever
   to address the environmental challenges currently faced by agriculture.
   Connecting and fostering local exchanges between specialised arable crop
   and livestock farms can support the diversification of crops and
   relocate animal feeding with local protein (vs. soya supplements).
   However, the trade-offs and synergies between individual and collective
   objectives and perfor-mances generated by this system are still largely
   unknown. Innovative tools that consider the spatiotemporal heterogeneity
   underpinning the daily functioning of farms are needed to explore the
   implications of exchange scenarios.
   OBJECTIVES: To assess self-sufficiency, sustainability and vulnerability
   at the farm, group (arable vs. livestock) and territorial levels
   considering the baseline situation and scenarios that increase synergy
   between arable and livestock farms.
   METHODS: We demonstrated the utility of using MAELIA, a spatial
   agent-based integrated modelling framework, to support iterative design
   and assessment of self-sufficiency, sustainability and vulnerability of
   such scenarios. MAELIA was applied to model a collective of five arable
   and two livestock farmers in western France. In a participatory
   approach, scientists, agricultural advisers and the farmers co-designed
   three possible scenarios of legume exchanges.
   RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Only the most ambitious scenario based on
   strong collaboration allowed farmers to reach local protein
   self-sufficiency while reducing the variability in five of the seven
   indicators used to assess farm performances. Meeting livestock farms'
   demand for legumes had a positive influence on socio-economic
   performance at the territorial level, including an increase in the mean
   gross margin (of 71 (sic)/ha; 4\% higher), decrease in the use of
   nitrogen fertiliser (of ca. 21 kg N/ha; 11\% lower) and decrease in
   labour time (of ca. 12 min/ha; 5\% lower). No major trade-offs between
   self-sufficiency and vulnerability were observed. However, there were
   distinct individual performances related to the degree of changes
   imposed on each farm.
   SIGNIFICANCE: We show that by reducing the dependence to external
   inputs, these systems are promising al-ternatives to an environmentally
   sustainable, resilient and economically viable agroecological
   transition. The development of dedicated institutional support for
   direct bilateral or multilateral agreements, and specific financial and
   technical support would encourage farmers to join such initiatives and
   redesign their farming systems.},

Abstract = {Consequences of global climate change are predicted to increase risks to
   crop production in the future. However, the possible broader impact of
   climate change on social-ecological systems still needs to be evaluated.
   Therefore, the present study focuses on one such globally important
   agricultural social-ecological system referred to as the Village Tank
   Cascade System (VTCS) in the dry zone of Sri Lanka. The VTCS has
   considerable potential to withstand seasonal climate variability mainly
   through continuous supply of water by the village tank storage
   throughout the year. The current study aimed to investigate trends of
   climate variability and possible impacts on paddy production in the
   North and North-central VTCS zone. Observed and projected rainfall and
   temperature data were analysed to evaluate the past variability trends
   (1970 to 2020) and model future (up to 2100) scenarios of climate
   variability and trends. Long-term observed rainfall and temperature data
   (1946 to 2020) were analysed to identify possible anomalies. The Maximum
   Entropy (MaxEnt) model has been used to predict the situation of future
   paddy farming (2050 and 2070) under two climate scenarios (RCP4.5 and
   RCP8.5) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Six
   variables that would affect paddy growth and yield quality were used
   alongside the average monthly rainfall and temperature of two Global
   Climate Models (MIROC5 and MPI-ESM-LR). Climate suitability for two
   paddy cultivation seasons (Yala and Maha) were predicted for current and
   future climate scenarios. The findings revealed that observed and
   projected climate changes show considerable deviation of expected
   rainfall and temperature trends across the VTCS zone. Temperature
   exhibits warming of approximately 1.0 \& DEG;C during the declared
   Global Warming Period (1970 to 2020) in the study area. In addition,
   there is a trend of significant warming by 0.02 \& DEG;C/year, RCP4.5
   and 0.03 \& DEG;C/year, RCP8.5 from 1950 to 2100. Rainfall (1970-2020)
   shows high interannual variability but trends were not significant and
   less discernible. However, long-term projected rainfall data (1950-2100)
   analysis detected a significant (p = 0) upward trend (2.0 mm/year,
   RCP4.5 and 2.9 mm/year, RCP8.5), which is expected to continue up to the
   end of this century. Further, the study revealed some shifts in
   temperature towards higher values and positive anomalies in rainfall
   affecting seasonality and the likelihood of more extreme occurrences in
   the future, especially during the Maha cultivation season. The MaxEnt
   model predicts the following under future climate scenarios: (i)
   spatio-temporal shifts (conversions) in climate suitability for paddy
   farming in the VTCS zone; (ii) substantial low and moderate suitability
   areas that are currently suitable will remain unchanged; (iii) up to
   96\% of highly suitable and 38\% of moderately suitable paddy growing
   areas in the VTCS zone will be at risk due to a decline in future
   climate suitability; and (iv) expansion of lower suitability areas by
   approximately 22\% to 37\%, due to conversion from moderate suitability
   areas. The study provides evidence that the continuous warming trend
   with increasing variability in rainfall and shifting seasonality could
   increase the vulnerability of future paddy farming in the VTCS. Thus,
   findings of this study will help planners to make more targeted
   solutions to improve adaptive capacity and regain the resilience to
   adjust the paddy farming pattern to deal with predicted climate
   variability and change.},
